Exploiting the factthat genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis; are independent of non-geneticconfounding; and are unmodified by disease processes; mendelian randomisation can beused to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease iscausal. Methods We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First; we used as aninstrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPGAsn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20 913 myocardial infarction cases; 95 407controls).

This analysis identified 13 loci newly associated with CAD at P< 5× 10− 8 andconfirmed the association of 10 of 12 previously reported CAD loci. The 13 new loci showedrisk allele frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.91 and were associated with a 6% to 17%increase in the risk of CAD per allele. Notably; only three of the new loci showed significantassociation with traditional CAD risk factors and the majority lie in gene regions notpreviously implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD.

Frequent pattern mining: current status and future directions,Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Dong Xin; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research for overa decade. Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendousprogress has been made; ranging from efficient and scalable algorithms for frequent itemsetmining in transaction databases to numerous research frontiers; such as sequential patternmining; structured pattern mining; correlation mining; associative classification; and frequentpattern-based clustering; as well as their broad applications. In this article; we provide a briefoverview of the current status of frequent pattern mining and discuss a few promisingresearch directions. We believe that frequent pattern mining research has substantiallybroadened the scope of data analysis and will have deep impact on data miningmethodologies and applications in the long run.

Search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons in the vector boson fusion and associated ZH production modes,CMS collaboration,Abstract: A search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons is performed using the vector bosonfusion and associated ZH production modes. In the ZH mode; the Z boson is required todecay to a pair of charged leptons or ab b-bar quark pair. The searches use the 8 TeV ppcollision dataset collected by the CMS detector at the LHC; corresponding to an integratedluminosity of up to 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Certain channels include data from 7 TeVcollisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 inverse femtobarns. The searchesare sensitive to non-standard-model invisible decays of the recently observed Higgs boson;as well as additional Higgs bosons with similar production modes and large invisiblebranching fractions. In all channels; the observed data are consistent with the expectedstandard model backgrounds. Limits are set on the production cross section times …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1404.1344,2014,711
Graph clustering based on structural/attribute similarities,Yang Zhou; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into differentclusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity.Graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in alarge graph. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topologicalstructure for clustering; but largely ignore the vertex properties which are oftenheterogenous. In this paper; we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm; SA-Cluster;based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Ourmethod partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each clustercontains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effectivemethod is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,541
Approximately median-unbiased estimation of autoregressive models,Donald WK Andrews; Hong-Yuan Chen,This article introduces approximately median-unbiased estimators for univariate AR (p)models with time trends. Confidence intervals also are considered. The methods are appliedto the Nelson–Plosser macroeconomic data series; the extended Nelson–Plossermacroeconomic data series; and some annual stock-dividend and price series. The resultsshow that most of the series exhibit substantially greater persistence than least squaresestimates and some Bayesian estimates suggest. For example; for the extended Nelson–Plosser data set; 8 of the 14 series are estimated to have a unit root; but 6 are estimated tobe trend stationary. In contrast; the least squares estimates indicate trend stationarity for allof the series.,Journal of Business & Economic Statistics,1994,496
Viral reorganization of the secretory pathway generates distinct organelles for RNA replication,Nai-Yun Hsu; Olha Ilnytska; Georgiy Belov; Marianita Santiana; Ying-Han Chen; Peter M Takvorian; Cyrilla Pau; Hilde van der Schaar; Neerja Kaushik-Basu; Tamas Balla; Craig E Cameron; Ellie Ehrenfeld; Frank JM van Kuppeveld; Nihal Altan-Bonnet,Summary Many RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes to generate specialized sitesfor RNA replication. How membranes are remodeled and what properties make themconducive for replication are unknown. Here we show how RNA viruses can manipulatemultiple components of the cellular secretory pathway to generate organelles specialized forreplication that are distinct in protein and lipid composition from the host cell. Specific viralproteins modulate effector recruitment by Arf1 GTPase and its guanine nucleotide exchangefactor GBF1; promoting preferential recruitment of phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIβ(PI4KIIIβ) to membranes over coat proteins; yielding uncoated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) lipid-enriched organelles.

Discriminative frequent pattern analysis for effective classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Chih-Wei Hsu,The application of frequent patterns in classification appeared in sporadic studies andachieved initial success in the classification of relational data; text documents and graphs. Inthis paper; we conduct a systematic exploration of frequent pattern-based classification; andprovide solid reasons supporting this methodology. It was well known that featurecombinations (patterns) could capture more underlying semantics than single features.However; inclusion of infrequent patterns may not significantly improve the accuracy due totheir limited predictive power. By building a connection between pattern frequency anddiscriminative measures such as information gain and Fisher score; we develop a strategy toset minimum support in frequent pattern mining for generating useful patterns. Based on thisstrategy; coupled with a proposed feature selection algorithm; discriminative frequent …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,370
Mining significant graph patterns by leap search,Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract With ever-increasing amounts of graph data from disparate sources; there has beena strong need for exploiting significant graph patterns with user-specified objective functions.Most objective functions are not antimonotonic; which could fail all of frequency-centricgraph mining algorithms. In this paper; we give the first comprehensive study on generalmining method aiming to find most significant patterns directly. Our new mining framework;called LEAP (Descending Leap Mine); is developed to exploit the correlation betweenstructural similarity and significance similarity in a way that the most significant pattern couldbe identified quickly by searching dissimilar graph patterns. Two novel concepts; structuralleap search and frequency descending mining; are proposed to support leap search ingraph pattern space.

Rankclus: integrating clustering with ranking for heterogeneous information network analysis,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Peixiang Zhao; Zhijun Yin; Hong Cheng; Tianyi Wu,Abstract As information networks become ubiquitous; extracting knowledge from informationnetworks has become an important task. Both ranking and clustering can provide overallviews on information network data; and each has been a hot topic by itself. However;ranking objects globally without considering which clusters they belong to often leads todumb results; eg; ranking database and computer architecture conferences together may notmake much sense. Similarly; clustering a huge number of objects (eg; thousands of authors)in one huge cluster without distinction is dull as well. In this paper; we address the problemof generating clusters for a specified type of objects; as well as ranking information for alltypes of objects based on these clusters in a multi-typed (ie; heterogeneous) informationnetwork. A novel clustering framework called RankClus is proposed that directly …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,297
A major QTL; Ghd8; plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity; plant height; and heading date in rice,Wen-Hao Yan; Peng Wang; Hua-Xia Chen; Hong-Ju Zhou; Qiu-Ping Li; Chong-Rong Wang; Ze-Hong Ding; Yu-Shan Zhang; Si-Bin Yu; Yong-Zhong Xing; Qi-Fa Zhang,ABSTRACT Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by quantitative traitloci (QTLs). The dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying rice yield traits is importantfor developing high-yielding rice varieties. Here; we report the cloning and characterizationof Ghd8; a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield; heading date; and plant height.Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of Ghd8. Ghd8was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative genes; of which one encodesthe OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene wasregarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A complementary test confirmed the identity andpleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly; the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on itsgenetic background.

Projection-pursuit approach to robust dispersion matrices and principal components: primary theory and Monte Carlo,Guoying Li; Zhonglian Chen,Abstract This article proposes and discusses a type of new robust estimators forcovariance/correlation matrices and principal components via projection-pursuit techniques.The most attractive advantage of the new procedures is that they are of both rotationalequivariance and high breakdown point. Besides; they are qualitatively robust andconsistent at elliptic underlying distributions. The Monte Carlo study shows that the best ofthe new estimators compare favorably with other robust methods. They provide as good aperformance as M-estimators and somewhat better empirical breakdown properties.,Journal of the American Statistical Association,1985,283
Facile preparation of amperometric laccase biosensor with multifunction based on the matrix of carbon nanotubes–chitosan composite,Ying Liu; Xiaohu Qu; Hongwei Guo; Hongjun Chen; Baifeng Liu; Shaojun Dong,Abstract The carbon nanotubes–chitosan (CNTs–CS) composite provides a suitablebiosensing matrix due to its good conductivity; high stability; and good biocompatibility.Enzymes can be firmly incorporated into the matrix without the aid of other cross-linkingreagents. The composite is easy to form insoluble film in solution above pH 6.3. Based onthis; a facilely fabricated amperometric biosensor by entrapping laccase into the CNTs–CScomposite film has been developed. At pH 6.0; the fungi laccase incorporated into thecomposite film remains better catalytic activity than that dissolved in solution. The system isin favor of the accessibility of substrate to the active site of laccase; thus the affinity tosubstrates is improved greatly; such as 2; 2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonicacid) diammonium salt (ABTS); catechol; and O 2 with K m values of 19.86 μM; 9.43 μM …,Biosensors and Bioelectronics,2006,268

Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng,Abstract A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results.In many cases; a high min_sup threshold may discover only commonsense patterns but alow one may generate an explosive number of output patterns; which severely restricts itsusage. In this paper; we study the problem of compressing frequent-pattern sets. Typically;frequent patterns can be clustered with a tightness measure δ (called δ-cluster); and arepresentative pattern can be selected for each cluster. Unfortunately; finding a minimum setof representative patterns is NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods; RPglobal andRPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computationalcomplexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Ourperformance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,250

IncSpan: incremental mining of sequential patterns in large database,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real life sequence databases grow incrementally. It is undesirable to minesequential patterns from scratch each time when a small set of sequences grow; or whensome new sequences are added into the database. Incremental algorithm should bedeveloped for sequential pattern mining so that mining can be adapted to incrementaldatabase updates. However; it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally;especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may leadto the generation of many new patterns due to the interactions of the growing subsequenceswith the original ones. In this study; we develop an efficient algorithm; IncSpan; forincremental mining of sequential patterns; by exploring some interesting properties. Ourperformance study shows that IncSpan outperforms some previously proposed …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,245

In situ growth of NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays on Ni foam for supercapacitors: maximizing utilization efficiency at high mass loading to achieve ultrahigh areal pseudoca...,Haichao Chen; Jianjun Jiang; Li Zhang; Dandan Xia; Yuandong Zhao; Danqing Guo; Tong Qi; Houzhao Wan,Abstract Self-standing NiCo 2 S 4 nanotube arrays have been in situ grown on Ni foam bythe anion-exchange reaction and directly used as the electrode for supercapacitors. TheNiCo 2 S 4 nanotube in the arrays effectively reduces the inactive material and increases theelectroactive surface area because of the ultrathin wall; which is quite competent to achievehigh utilization efficiency at high electroactive materials mass loading. The NiCo 2 S 4nanotube arrays hybrid electrode exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 14.39 F cm− 2at 5 mA cm− 2 with excellent rate performance (67.7% retention for current increases 30times) and cycling stability (92% retention after 5000 cycles) at a high mass loading of 6 mgcm− 2. High areal capacitance (4.68 F cm− 2 at 10 mA cm− 2); high energy density (31.5 Whkg− 1 at 156.6 W kg− 1) and high power density (2348.5 W kg− 1 at 16.6 Wh kg− 1) can …,Journal of Power Sources,2014,225
Summarizing itemset patterns: a profile-based approach,Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin,Abstract Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively on scalable methods formining various kinds of patterns including itemsets; sequences; and graphs. However; thebottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability; due tothe huge number of patterns generated by the mining process. In this paper; we examinehow to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives; a smallnumber of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not onlycover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative modelis built to extract and profile these representatives; under which the supports of the patternscan be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset. Based on the restorationerror; we propose a quality measure function to determine the optimal value of parameter …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,222
Direct discriminative pattern mining for effective classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,The application of frequent patterns in classification has demonstrated its power in recentstudies. It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule) miningfollowed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However; this two-step process could becomputationally expensive; especially when the problem scale is large or the minimumsupport is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge numberof" patterns" that could not only slow down the mining process but also make featureselection hard to complete. In this paper; we propose a direct discriminative pattern miningapproach; DDPMine; to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach.DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative patternswithout generating the complete pattern set. Instead of selecting best patterns in a batch …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,214

To better understand this variability; theobjective of this study was to predict brain extracellular fluid (ECF) concentrations andreceptor occupancy of clozapine and norclozapine in human central nervous system bytranslating plasma and brain ECF pharmacokinetic (PK) relationships in the rat and couplingthese with known human disposition of clozapine in the plasma. Unbound concentrations ofclozapine and norclozapine were measured in rat brain ECF using quantitative microdialysisafter subcutaneous administration of a 10 mg/kg single dose of clozapine or norclozapine.These data were linked with plasma concentrations obtained in the same rats to develop aplasma–brain ECF compartmental model.

Maladaptive role of IL-6 in ischemic acute renal failure,Mariusz L Kielar; Reji John; Michael Bennett; James A Richardson; John M Shelton; Liying Chen; D Rohan Jeyarajah; Xin J Zhou; Hui Zhou; Brett Chiquett; Glenn T Nagami; Christopher Y Lu,Abstract The role of IL-6 was investigated in murine ischemic acute renal failure. The renalpedicles were clamped for 17 min; and the mice were studied at various times afterreperfusion. We found that serum IL-6 increased after murine ischemic renal injury. Thisincrease was associated with increased IL-6 mRNA in the ischemic kidney but not in thecontralateral kidney or the liver. Maximal IL-6 production occurred at 4 to 8 h and decreasedto baseline by 24 h. Reperfusion of the kidney was required for IL-6 production. In situhybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that macrophages infiltrated areasadjacent to the vascular bundles in the outer medulla within hours of reperfusion andshowed that these macrophages produced IL-6 mRNA.

Classification of software behaviors for failure detection: a discriminative pattern mining approach,David Lo; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Siau-Cheng Khoo; Chengnian Sun,Abstract Software is a ubiquitous component of our daily life. We often depend on the correctworking of software systems. Due to the difficulty and complexity of software systems; bugsand anomalies are prevalent. Bugs have caused billions of dollars loss; in addition toprivacy and security threats. In this work; we address software reliability issues by proposinga novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs. With thetechnique; it is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures andanomalies. Our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitiveseries of events from program execution traces. It then performs feature selection to selectthe best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to detectfailures.

SHANK3 overexpression causes manic-like behaviour with unique pharmacogenetic properties,Kihoon Han; J Lloyd Holder Jr; Christian P Schaaf; Hui Lu; Hongmei Chen; Hyojin Kang; Jianrong Tang; Zhenyu Wu; Shuang Hao; Sau Wai Cheung; Peng Yu; Hao Sun; Amy M Breman; Ankita Patel; Hui-Chen Lu; Huda Y Zoghbi,Abstract Mutations in SHANK3 and large duplications of the region spanning SHANK3 bothcause a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders; indicating that proper SHANK3 dosage iscritical for normal brain function. However; SHANK3 overexpression per se has not beenestablished as a cause of human disorders because 22q13 duplications involve severalgenes. Here we report that Shank3 transgenic mice modelling a human SHANK3duplication exhibit manic-like behaviour and seizures consistent with synapticexcitatory/inhibitory imbalance. We also identified two patients with hyperkinetic disorderscarrying the smallest SHANK3-spanning duplications reported so far. These findingsindicate that SHANK3 overexpression causes a hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorder. Toprobe the mechanism underlying the phenotype; we generated a Shank3 in vivo …,Nature,2013,161
NiCo 2 S 4 porous nanotubes synthesis via sacrificial templates: high-performance electrode materials of supercapacitors,Houzhao Wan; Jianjun Jiang; Jingwen Yu; Kui Xu; Ling Miao; Li Zhang; Haichao Chen; Yunjun Ruan,Recently; transition metal sulfides; such as CoS; 7 NiS; 8 MoS 2 ; 9 have been tried as a newtype of electrode materials and have achieved good performance. For instance; cobalt sulfidenanowires showed a high specific capacitance of 508 F g −1 at 2.5 A g −1 . 10 Ni 3 S 2 achieveda high capacitance of 717 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 . 11 In addition; the binary Ni–Co sulfides; similarto the binary Ni–Co oxides; may possess higher electrochemical activity than nickel sulfidesand cobalt sulfides based on richer redox reactions. 12 The binary Ni–Co sulfide nanostructuresmay be expected to be a potential candidate for the applications of supercapacitors … A perfectelectrode material of a faradic pseudocapacitor is that of rougher nanostructures with large specificsurface areas which immediately lead to electrolyte ions more efficiently contacting more electroactivesites for faradic energy storage. 13 An effective route is to construct a nanotube with …,CrystEngComm,2013,158
A model-based approach to attributed graph clustering,Zhiqiang Xu; Yiping Ke; Yi Wang; Hong Cheng; James Cheng,Abstract Graph clustering; also known as community detection; is a long-standing problem indata mining. However; with the proliferation of rich attribute information available for objectsin real-world graphs; how to leverage structural and attribute information for clusteringattributed graphs becomes a new challenge. Most existing works take a distance-basedapproach. They proposed various distance measures to combine structural and attributeinformation. In this paper; we consider an alternative view and propose a model-basedapproach to attributed graph clustering. We develop a Bayesian probabilistic model forattributed graphs. The model provides a principled and natural framework for capturing bothstructural and attribute aspects of a graph; while avoiding the artificial design of a distancemeasure. Clustering with the proposed model can be transformed into a probabilistic …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2012,156

Identification of phosphatases for Smad in the BMP/DPP pathway,Hong B Chen; Jiali Shen; Y Tony Ip; Lan Xu,Abstract Phosphorylation of the SSXS motif of Smads is critical in activating the transforminggrowth factor β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways. However; thephosphatase (s) involved in dephosphorylating and hence inactivating Smads remainedelusive. Through RNA interference (RNAi)-based screening of serine/threoninephosphatases in Drosophila S2 cells; we identified pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase(PDP) to be required for dephosphorylation of Mothers against Decapentaplegic (MAD); aDrosophila Smad. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggest that PDP directlydephosphorylates MAD and inhibits signal transduction of Decapentaplegic (DPP). Weshow that the mammalian PDPs are important in dephosphorylation of BMP-activatedSmad1 but not TGF-β-activated Smad2 or Smad3. Thus; PDPs specifically inactivate …,Genes & development,2006,149
Direct mining of discriminative and essential frequent patterns via model-based search tree,Wei Fan; Kun Zhang; Hong Cheng; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip Yu; Olivier Verscheure,Abstract Frequent patterns provide solutions to datasets that do not have well-structuredfeature vectors. However; frequent pattern mining is non-trivial since the number of uniquepatterns is exponential but many are non-discriminative and correlated. Currently; frequentpattern mining is performed in two sequential steps: enumerating a set of frequent patterns;followed by feature selection. Although many methods have been proposed in the past fewyears on how to perform each separate step efficiently; there is still limited success ineventually finding highly compact and discriminative patterns. The culprit is due to theinherent nature of this widely adopted two-step approach. This paper discusses theseproblems and proposes a new and different method. It builds a decision tree that partitionsthe data onto different nodes. Then at each node; it directly discovers a discriminative …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,136
Adaptive responses of Lepidium latifolium to soil flooding: biomass allocation; adventitious rooting; aerenchyma formation and ethylene production,Hongjun Chen; Robert G Qualls; Glenn C Miller,Abstract Lepidium latifolium; perennial pepperweed; is an exotic crucifer that has spreadexplosively in recent years in wetlands and riparian areas of the western United States.Adaptive responses of L. latifolium to different durations of 0; 3; 7; 15; 30 and 50-day soilflooding treatment were investigated. Biomass allocation; adventitious rooting; aerenchymadevelopment and ethylene production in plants were measured. Compared with controlsmaintained at− 20 kPa soil matric water potential; flooding stress reduced total biomass of L.latifolium. After 7 days of flooding; the total biomass and root/shoot ratio of flooded plantswere significantly less than those of unflooded controls. The number of adventitious roots onthe stem base increased with the duration of flooding. Root porosity was much higher in theflooded plants than in the unflooded controls after 3 days of treatment and rose to 43 …,Environmental and Experimental Botany,2002,132
Photolithographic boronate affinity molecular imprinting: a general and facile approach for glycoprotein imprinting,Li Li; Yue Lu; Zijun Bie; Hong‐Yuan Chen; Zhen Liu,Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs);[1] as economical and stable mimics of antibodiesand enzymes; have found important applications; such as chemical separation andcatalysis. The imprinting of proteins is challenging; which is due to conformational changesduring polymerization and slow mass transfer in the polymers.[2] Although severalstrategies; such as surface imprinting;[3] epitope imprinting;[4] and Pickering emulsions;[5]have been proposed to solve these issues; the imprinting of proteins still remains achallenge. Glycoproteins; which occupy more than 50% of the total proteins in mammaliansystems; play key roles in many biological processes; such as molecular recognition; inter-and intra-cellular signaling; and immune response. Furthermore; many glycoproteins aredisease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Therefore; the imprinting of glycoproteins is …,Angewandte Chemie,2013,130
Identifying bug signatures using discriminative graph mining,Hong Cheng; David Lo; Yang Zhou; Xiaoyin Wang; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Bug localization has attracted a lot of attention recently. Most existing methodsfocus on pinpointing a single statement or function call which is very likely to contain bugs.Although such methods could be very accurate; it is usually very hard for developers tounderstand the context of the bug; given each bug location in isolation. In this study; wepropose to model software executions with graphs at two levels of granularity: methods andbasic blocks. An individual node represents a method or basic block and an edgerepresents a method call; method return or transition (at the method or basic blockgranularity). Given a set of graphs of correct and faulty executions; we propose to extract themost discriminative subgraphs which contrast the program flow of correct and faultyexecutions. The extracted subgraphs not only pinpoint the bug; but also provide an …,Proceedings of the eighteenth international symposium on Software testing and analysis,2009,128
One-step preparation and characterization of PDDA-protected gold nanoparticles,Hongjun Chen; Yuling Wang; Yizhe Wang; Shaojun Dong; Erkang Wang,Abstract Poly (diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA); an ordinary and watersolublecationic polyelectrolyte; was investigated for its ability to generate and stabilize gold colloidsfrom a chloroauric acid precursor. In this reaction; PDDA acted as both reducing andstabilizing agents for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). More importantly; PDDA is a quaternaryammonium polyelectrolyte; which shows that the scope of the reducing and stabilizingagents for metal nanoparticles can be extended from the amine-containing molecules toquaternary ammonium polyelectrolytes or salts. UV–vis spectroscopy; transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM); X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)were used to characterize the synthetic AuNPs. The PDDA-protected AuNPs obtained arevery stable and have relative narrow size distribution.,Polymer,2006,128
Ionic liquid-enhanced solid state electrolyte interface (SEI) for lithium–sulfur batteries,Jianming Zheng; Meng Gu; Honghao Chen; Praveen Meduri; Mark H Engelhard; Ji-Guang Zhang; Jun Liu; Jie Xiao,Li–S batteries are a complicated system with many challenges existing before their finalmarket penetration. While most of the reported work for Li–S batteries is focused on thecathode design; we demonstrate in this work that the anode consumption accelerated bycorrosive polysulfide solution also critically determines the Li–S cell performance. Tovalidate this hypothesis; ionic liquid (IL) N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Py14TFSI) has been employed to modify the properties of theSEI layer formed on the Li metal surface in Li–S batteries. It is found that the IL-enhancedpassivation film on the lithium anode surface exhibits very different morphology andchemical composition; effectively protecting lithium metal from continuous attack by solublepolysulfides. Therefore; both the cell impedance and the irreversible consumption of …,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,2013,124
Mining e-Learning domain concept map from academic articles,Nian-Shing Chen; Chun-Wang Wei; Hong-Jhe Chen,Abstract Recent researches have demonstrated the importance of concept map and itsversatile applications especially in e-Learning. For example; while designing adaptivelearning materials; designers need to refer to the concept map of a subject domain.Moreover; concept maps can show the whole picture and core knowledge about a subjectdomain. Research from literature also suggests that graphical representation of domainknowledge can reduce the problems of information overload and learning disorientation forlearners. However; construction of concept maps typically relied upon domain experts in thepast; it is a time consuming and high cost task. Concept maps creation for emerging newdomains such as e-Learning is even more challenging due to its ongoing developmentnature.

Extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns,Dong Xin; Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Observed in many applications; there is a potential need of extracting a small set offrequent patterns having not only high significance but also low redundancy. Thesignificance is usually defined by the context of applications. Previous studies have beenconcentrating on how to compute top-k significant patterns or how to remove redundancyamong patterns separately. There is limited work on finding those top-k patterns whichdemonstrate high-significance and low-redundancy simultaneously. In this paper; we studythe problem of extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns from a large collection offrequent patterns. We first examine the evaluation functions for measuring the combinedsignificance of a pattern set and propose the MMS (Maximal Marginal Significance) as theproblem formulation. The problem is known as NP-hard. We further present a greedy …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,124

Facilely synthesized porous NiCo2O4 flowerlike nanostructure for high-rate supercapacitors,Haichao Chen; Jianjun Jiang; Li Zhang; Tong Qi; Dandan Xia; Houzhao Wan,Abstract We have developed a facile and scalable method to grow porous NiCo 2 O 4nanostructure. The conductivity is measured by a linear sweep voltammetry; which indicatesthat the conductivity of the NiCo 2 O 4 sample is at least two orders of magnitude higher thanthose of NiO and Co 3 O 4 samples. The conductive NiCo 2 O 4 hybrid electrode delivers anenhanced specific capacitance of 658 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 compared to NiO and Co 3 O 4.Excellent rate capability; 78% specific capacitance retention for a 20-time current densityincrease and 77% specific capacitance retention for a 50-time scan rate rise; is achieved.The NiCo 2 O 4 sample demonstrates ultralong cycling lifespan; no observable degradationis found for the total cycle numbers as high as 10000 cycles.

Surface enhanced Raman scattering of p-aminothiophenol self-assembled monolayers in sandwich structure fabricated on glass,Yuling Wang; Hongjun Chen; Shaojun Dong; Erkang Wang,A sandwich structure consisting of Ag nanoparticles (NPs); p-aminothiophenol (p-ATP) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs); and Ag NPs was fabricated on glass and characterized bysurface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The SERS spectrum of ap-ATP SAM in suchsandwich structure shows that the electromagnetic enhancement is greater than that on AgNPs assembled on glass. The obtained enhancement factors (EF) on solely one sandwichstructure were as large as 6.0±0.62× 10 4 and 1.2±0.62× 10 7 for the 7 a and 3 b (b 2)vibration modes; respectively. The large enhancement effect of p-ATP SAMs is likely a resultof plasmon coupling between the two layers of Ag NP (localized surface plasmon)resonance; creating a large localized electromagnetic field at their interface; where p-ATPresides. Moreover; the fact that large EF values (∼ 1.9±0.7× 10 4 and 9.4±0.7× 10 6 for …,The Journal of chemical physics,2006,118
Clustering large attributed graphs: An efficient incremental approach,Yang Zhou; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In recent years; many networks have become available for analysis; including socialnetworks; sensor networks; biological networks; etc. Graph clustering has shown itseffectiveness in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goal of graph clustering is topartition vertices in a large graph into clusters based on various criteria such as vertexconnectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graph clustering methods mainlyfocus on the topological structures; but largely ignore the vertex properties which are oftenheterogeneous. Recently; a new graph clustering algorithm; SA-Cluster; has been proposedwhich combines structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. SA-Cluster performs matrix multiplication to calculate the random walk distances between graphvertices.

Sparse hashing for fast multimedia search,Xiaofeng Zhu; Zi Huang; Hong Cheng; Jiangtao Cui; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Hash-based methods achieve fast similarity search by representing high-dimensional data with compact binary codes. However; both generating binary codes andencoding unseen data effectively and efficiently remain very challenging tasks. In this article;we focus on these tasks to implement approximate similarity search by proposing a novelhash based method named sparse hashing (SH for short). To generate interpretable (orsemantically meaningful) binary codes; the proposed SH first converts original data into low-dimensional data through a novel nonnegative sparse coding method. SH then converts thelow-dimensional data into Hamming space (ie; binary encoding low-dimensional data) by anew binarization rule. After this; training data are represented by generated binary codes.

AMIGO and friends: an emerging family of brain-enriched; neuronal growth modulating; type I transmembrane proteins with leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and cell adhe...,Yanan Chen; Selina Aulia; Lingzhi Li; Bor Luen Tang,Abstract Leucine-rich repeats (LRR) are protein–protein interaction domains (20–29 aminoacid residues in length) found in proteins with diverse structure and functions. We note herean emerging group of central nervous system-enriched; type I surface proteins with anectodomain containing LRR repeats and motifs found in cell adhesion molecules. Membersof this group include the Amphoterin-induced gene and ORF-1 (AMIGO-1); LRR and Igdomain containing Nogo Receptor interacting protein I (LINGO-1) and the netrin-G1 ligandNGL-1. The above proteins carry; in addition to the LRR repeats; an immunoglobin (Ig)-likesegment in their ectodomain.

Near-optimal supervised feature selection among frequent subgraphs,Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Jiawei Han; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alex Smola; Le Song; Philip S Yu; Xifeng Yan; Karsten Borgwardt,Abstract Graph classification is an increasingly important step in numerous applicationdomains; such as function prediction of molecules and proteins; computerised sceneanalysis; and anomaly detection in program flows. Among the various approaches proposedin the literature; graph classification based on frequent subgraphs is a popular branch:Graphs are represented as (usually binary) vectors; with components indicating whether agraph contains a particular subgraph that is frequent across the dataset. On large graphs;however; one faces the enormous problem that the number of these frequent subgraphsmay grow exponentially with the size of the graphs; but only few of them possess enoughdiscriminative power to make them useful for graph classification. Efficient and discriminativefeature selection among frequent subgraphs is hence a key challenge for graph mining …,*,2009,103

What's your next move: User activity prediction in location-based social networks,Jihang Ye; Zhe Zhu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Location-based social networks have been gaining increasing popularity in recentyears. To increase users' engagement with location-based services; it is important to provideattractive features; one of which is geo-targeted ads and coupons. To make ads and coupondelivery more effective; it is essential to predict the location that is most likely to be visited bya user at the next step. However; an inherent challenge in location prediction is a hugeprediction space; with millions of distinct check-in locations as prediction target. In this paperwe exploit the check-in category information to model the underlying user movement pattern.We propose a framework which uses a mixed hidden Markov model to predict the categoryof user activity at the next step and then predict the most likely location given the estimatedcategory distribution. The advantages of modeling the category level include a …,*,2013,98
Alternating layer and island growth of Pb on Si by spontaneous quantum phase separation,Hawoong Hong; C-M Wei; MY Chou; Z Wu; L Basile; H Chen; M Holt; T-C Chiang,Abstract Real-time in situ x-ray studies of continuous Pb deposition on S i (111)−(7× 7) at180 K reveal an unusual growth behavior. A wetting layer forms first to cover the entiresurface. Then islands of a fairly uniform height of about five monolayers form on top of thewetting layer and grow to fill the surface. The growth then switches to a layer-by-layer modeupon further deposition. This behavior of alternating layer and island growth can beattributed to spontaneous quantum phase separation based on a first-principles calculationof the system energy.,Physical review letters,2003,98

Effect of low frequency ultrasound on the in vitro percutaneous absorption of clobetasol 17-propionate,Jia-You Fang; Chia-Lang Fang; KC Sung; Hsiang-Yin Chen,Abstract The effect of low frequency ultrasound (20 kHz) on the permeation of clobetasol 17-propionate (CP) through skin (sonophoresis) was studied. The ultrasound was applied ateither continuous or discontinuous modes and at different intensities. The results showedthat low frequency ultrasound significantly enhanced the permeability of CP across hairlessmouse skin in vitro. Delivering the same amount of ultrasonic energy in different modes ofapplication markedly influenced the flux and skin residual of CP. The on/off discontinuousultrasound had greater enhancement on CP permeation than the continuous ultrasound.The results of skin histopathology and permeation experiment using various membranesdemonstrate that both disordering of stratum corneum and convective flow resulted from thecavitation effect were responsible for sonophoretic enhancement of CP.

Among thesecatalysts; ZrO (OH) 2· xH 2 O was found to be most active. EL conversion of 93.6% and GVLselectivity of 94.5% were achieved when 2-propanol was used as a hydrogen donor at 473K with a reaction time of only 1 h. The complete reaction pathway and the probable main by-products for the conversion of EL to GVL were clearly deduced for the first time. The ZrO(OH) 2· xH 2 O catalyst could be reused at least ten times without any significant loss ofcatalytic activity. Furthermore; characterizations were carried out on the fresh and spent ZrO(OH) 2· xH 2 O catalysts with XRD; FT-IR; BET; TGA-DTA.

Realizing a SnO 2-based ultraviolet light-emitting diode via breaking the dipole-forbidden rule,Yongfeng Li; Wanjian Yin; Rui Deng; Rui Chen; Jing Chen; Qingyu Yan; Bin Yao; Handong Sun; Su-Huai Wei; Tom Wu,Abstract Although many oxide semiconductors possess wide bandgaps in the ultraviolet(UV) regime; currently the majority of them cannot efficiently emit UV light because the band-edge optical transition is forbidden in a perfect lattice as a result of the symmetry of the band-edge states. This quantum mechanical rule severely constrains the optical applications ofwide-bandgap oxides; which is also the reason why so few oxides enjoy the success of ZnO.Here; using SnO 2 as an example; we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentallythat UV photoluminescence and electroluminescence can be recovered and enhanced inwide-bandgap oxide thin films with 'forbidden'energy gaps by engineering theirnanocrystalline structures.

Mining discriminative patterns for classifying trajectories on road networks,Jae-Gil Lee; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Hong Cheng,Classification has been used for modeling many kinds of data sets; including sets of items;text documents; graphs; and networks. However; there is a lack of study on a new kind ofdata; trajectories on road networks. Modeling such data is useful with the emerging GPS andRFID technologies and is important for effective transportation and traffic planning. In thiswork; we study methods for classifying trajectories on road networks. By analyzing thebehavior of trajectories on road networks; we observe that; in addition to the locations wherevehicles have visited; the order of these visited locations is crucial for improvingclassification accuracy. Based on our analysis; we contend that (frequent) sequentialpatterns are good feature candidates since they preserve this order information.Furthermore; when mining sequential patterns; we propose to confine the length of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,82

Focusing of tandem bistatic SAR data using the chirp-scaling algorithm,Shichao Chen; Mengdao Xing; Song Zhou; Lei Zhang; Zheng Bao,Abstract Based on an exact analytical bistatic point target spectrum; an efficient chirp-scalingalgorithm is proposed to correct the range cell migration of different range gates to the one ofthe reference range for tandem bistatic synthetic aperture radar data processing. The lengthof the baseline (baseline to range ratio) does not give a direct influence to the proposedalgorithm; which can be applied to the processing of tandem bistatic data with a largebaseline even when the baseline is equal to the range. No interpolation is needed duringthe entire processing; only fast Fourier transforms and phase multiplications are needed;which result in efficiency. The validity of the proposed algorithm has been verified bysimulated experiments.,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,2013,78

Hybrid rice isone of the most successful apotheoses in crops utilizing heterosis. Transcriptional profilingof F 1 super-hybrid rice Liangyou-2186 and its parents by serial analysis of gene expression(SAGE) revealed 1183 differentially expressed genes (DGs); among which DGs were foundsignificantly enriched in pathways such as photosynthesis and carbon-fixation; and most ofthe key genes involved in the carbon-fixation pathway exhibited up-regulated expression inF 1 hybrid rice. Moreover; increased catabolic activity of corresponding enzymes andphotosynthetic efficiency were also detected; which combined to indicate that carbon fixationis enhanced in F 1 hybrid; and might probably be associated with the yield vigor and …,Molecular plant,2010,77
pH-dependent conformational flexibility within the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center,GREGORY W MUTH; LI CHEN; ANNE B KOSEK; SCOTT A STROBEL,Abstract A universally conserved adenosine; A2451; within the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center has been proposed to act as a general acid–base catalyst during peptidebond formation. Evidence in support of this proposal came from pH-dependentdimethylsulfate (DMS) modification within Escherichia coli ribosomes. A2451 displayedreactivity consistent with an apparent acidity constant (p K a) near neutrality; though pH-dependent structural flexibility could not be rigorously excluded as an explanation for theenhanced reactivity at high pH. Here we present three independent lines of evidence insupport of the alternative interpretation. First; A2451 in ribosomes from the archaebacteriaHaloarcula marismortui displays an inverted pH profile that is inconsistent with proton-mediated base protection. Second; in ribosomes from the yeast Saccharomyces …,RNA,2001,76
Multilayer structured carbon nanotubes/poly-L-lysine/laccase composite cathode for glucose/O2 biofuel cell,Liu Deng; Li Shang; Yizhe Wang; Tie Wang; Hongjun Chen; Shaojun Dong,Abstract Multilayer film of laccase; poly-l-lysine (PLL) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes(MWNTs) were prepared by a layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. The results of the UV–vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrated a uniform growthof the multilayer. The catalytic behavior of the modified electrode was investigated. The(MWNTs/PLL/laccase) n multilayer modified electrode catalyzed four-electron reduction of O2 to water; without any mediator. The possible application of the laccase-catalyzed O 2reduction at the (MWNTs/PLL/laccase) n multilayer modified ITO electrode was illustrated byconstructing a glucose/O 2 biofuel cell with the (MWNTs/thionine/AuNPs) 8 GDH filmmodified ITO electrode as a bioanode and the (MWNTs/PLL/laccase) 15 film modified ITOelectrode as a biocathode.

The Wnt–β-catenin pathway represses let-7 microRNA expression through transactivation of Lin28 to augment breast cancer stem cell expansion,Wang-Yu Cai; Tong-Zhen Wei; Qi-Cong Luo; Qiu-Wan Wu; Qing-Feng Liu; Meng Yang; Guo-Dong Ye; Jia-Fa Wu; Yuan-Yuan Chen; Guang-Bin Sun; Yun-Jia Liu; Wen-Xiu Zhao; Zhi-Ming Zhang; Bo-An Li,Summary Wnt signalling through β-catenin and the lymphoid-enhancing factor 1/T-cell factor(LEF1/TCF) family of transcription factors maintains stem cell properties in both normal andmalignant tissues; however; the underlying molecular pathway involved in this process hasnot been completely defined. Using a microRNA microarray screening assay; we identifiedlet-7 miRNAs as downstream targets of the Wnt–β-catenin pathway. Expression studiesindicated that the Wnt–β-catenin pathway suppresses mature let-7 miRNAs but not theprimary transcripts; which suggests a post-transcriptional regulation of repression.Furthermore; we identified Lin28; a negative let-7 biogenesis regulator; as a novel directdownstream target of the Wnt–β-catenin pathway. Loss of function of Lin28 impairs Wnt–β-catenin-pathway-mediated let-7 inhibition and breast cancer stem cell expansion; …,J Cell Sci,2013,74

Their ability to thrive underlow-light conditions has been linked to the evolution of a novel chimeric photoreceptor—neochrome—that fuses red-sensing phytochrome and blue-sensing phototropin modulesinto a single gene; thereby optimizing phototropic responses. Despite being implicated infacilitating the diversification of modern ferns; the origin of neochrome has remained amystery. We present evidence for neochrome in hornworts (a bryophyte lineage) anddemonstrate that ferns acquired neochrome from hornworts via horizontal gene transfer(HGT). Fern neochromes are nested within hornwort neochromes in our large-scalephylogenetic reconstructions of phototropin and phytochrome gene families. Divergencedate estimates further support the HGT hypothesis; with fern and hornwort neochromes …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2014,73
Poly (N‐vinylpyrrolidone)‐modified surfaces for biomedical applications,Xiaoli Liu; Yajun Xu; Zhaoqiang Wu; Hong Chen,Abstract Poly (N-vinylpyrrolidone)(PVP); an important water soluble synthetic polymer; hasmany desirable properties including low toxicity; chemical stability; and goodbiocompatibility. Since PVP is hemocompatible and physiologically inactive; it has beenused as a blood plasma substitute. Surface modification with PVP has been investigatedextensively over the past few years as a means of preventing nonspecific protein adsorption.PVP may therefore be seen as a promising antifouling surface modifier comparable to poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG). In this review; various approaches for the design and preparation ofPVP-modified surfaces are summarized and potential biomedical applications of these PVP-modified materials are indicated. Finally; some perspectives on future research on PVP forsurface modification are discussed.,*,2013,73
Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Lu Qin; Wentao Tian; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Community detection which discovers densely connected structures in a networkhas been studied a lot. In this paper; we study online community search which is practicallyuseful but less studied in the literature. Given a query vertex in a graph; the problem is to findmeaningful communities that the vertex belongs to in an online manner. We propose a novelcommunity model based on the k-truss concept; which brings nice structural andcomputational properties. We design a compact and elegant index structure which supportsthe efficient search of k-truss communities with a linear cost with respect to the communitysize. In addition; we investigate the k-truss community search problem in a dynamic graphsetting with frequent insertions and deletions of graph vertices and edges.

By applying the three methods to common water samples; theefficiencies of XAD; PPL and RO/ED DOM isolation were compared. XAD recovered 42% ofdissolved organic carbon (DOC) from deep water (25% with XAD-8; 17% with XAD-4) and30% from surface water (16% with XAD-8; 14% with XAD-4). PPL recovered 61±3% of DOCfrom deep water and 61% from surface water. RO/ED recovered 82±3% of DOC from deepwater; 14±3% of which was recovered in a sodium hydroxide rinse; and 75±5% of DOC fromsurface water; with 12±2% in the sodium hydroxide rinse.

Complete and persistent phenotypic correction of phenylketonuria in mice by site-specific genome integration of murine phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA,Li Chen; Savio LC Woo,Abstract We explored the potential of using a bacteriophage integrase system to achieve site-specific genome integration of murine phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA in the livers ofphenylketonuric (PKU) mice. The phiBT1 phage integrase is an enzyme that catalyses theefficient recombination between unique sequences in the phage and bacterial genomes;leading to the site-specific integration of the former into the latter in a unidirectional manner.Here we showed that this phage integrase functions efficiently in mouse cells; and severalnaturally occurring pseudo-attP sites located in the intergenic regions of the mouse genomehave been identified and molecularly characterized. We further demonstrated that theaddition of nuclear localization signal sequences to the C terminus of the phage integraseenhanced the efficiency for transgene integration into the mouse genome.

Clustering large attributed graphs: A balance between structural and attribute similarities,Hong Cheng; Yang Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Social networks; sensor networks; biological networks; and many other informationnetworks can be modeled as a large graph. Graph vertices represent entities; and graphedges represent their relationships or interactions. In many large graphs; there is usuallyone or more attributes associated with every graph vertex to describe its properties. In manyapplication domains; graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting denselyconnected groups in a large graph as well as for understanding and visualizing a largegraph. The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into differentclusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity.Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure forclustering; but largely ignore the vertex properties; which are often heterogenous.

An effective hydrothermal route for the synthesis of multiple PDDA-protected noble-metal nanostructures,Hongjun Chen; Yuling Wang; Shaojun Dong,In this Article; we demonstrate an effective hydrothermal route for the synthesis of multiplePDDA-protected (PDDA= poly (diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride) noble-metal (includingsilver; platinum; palladium; and gold) nanostructures in the absence of any seeds andsurfactants; in which PDDA; an ordinary and water-soluble polyelectrolyte; acts as both areducing and a stabilizing agent. Under optimal experimental conditions; Ag nanocubes; Ptand Pd nanopolyhedrons; and Au nanoplates can be obtained; which were characterized bytransmission electron microscopy; scanning electron microscopy; energy-dispersivespectroscopy; and X-ray diffraction. More importantly; the nanostructures synthesized showpotential applications in surface-enhanced Raman scattering and electrocatalysis; in whichAg nanocubes and Pt nanopolyhedrons were chosen as the examples; respectively.,Inorganic chemistry,2007,70
Answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections: The ranking cube approach,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Xiaolei Li,Abstract Observed in many real applications; a top-k query often consists of two componentsto reflect a user's preference: a selection condition and a ranking function. A user may notonly propose ad hoc ranking functions; but also use different interesting subsets of the data.In many cases; a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processingmainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. Theproblem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not beenwell addressed yet. This paper proposes a new computational model; called ranking cube;for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube; capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,70
Synergistic effect of Fe3O4/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for supercapacitors with good cycling life,Tong Qi; Jianjun Jiang; Haichao Chen; Houzhao Wan; Ling Miao; Li Zhang,Abstract Fe 3 O 4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites were prepared through a facilehydrolysis route and subsequent annealing process and used as the electroactive materialsfor supercapacitors. The as-prepared Fe 3 O 4/rGO composites exhibit much higher specificcapacitances than either pure rGO or pure Fe 3 O 4; meanwhile; the electrochemicalperformance of Fe 3 O 4/rGO composites with different amount of RGO has been compared.The optimized Fe 3 O 4/rGO composites (FG-0.8) exhibit the highest specific capacitance of350.6 F g− 1 at 1 mV s− 1; 157.6 F g− 1 of the specific capacitance can still be retained whenthe scan rate increases 100 times to 100 mV s− 1; indicating a good rate capability. TheseFe 3 O 4/rGO composites also show excellent cycling performance without any decrease ofspecific capacitance after 10;000 cycles.

Enteroviruses harness the cellular endocytic machinery to remodel the host cell cholesterol landscape for effective viral replication,Olha Ilnytska; Marianita Santiana; Nai-Yun Hsu; Wen-Li Du; Ying-Han Chen; Ekaterina G Viktorova; Georgy Belov; Anita Brinker; Judith Storch; Christopher Moore; Joseph L Dixon; Nihal Altan-Bonnet,Summary Cholesterol is a critical component of cellular membranes; regulating assemblyand function of membrane-based protein/lipid complexes. Many RNA viruses; includingenteroviruses; remodel host membranes to generate organelles with unique lipid blueprintson which they assemble replication complexes and synthesize viral RNA. Here we find thatclathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is harnessed by enteroviruses to traffic cholesterolfrom the plasma membrane (PM) and extracellular medium to replication organelles; wherecholesterol then regulates viral polyprotein processing and facilitates genome synthesis.When CME is disrupted; cellular cholesterol pools are instead stored in lipid droplets;cholesterol cannot be trafficked to replication organelles; and replication is inhibited. Incontrast; replication is stimulated in cholesterol-elevated cells like those lacking caveolins …,Cell host & microbe,2013,69

Forward semi-supervised feature selection,Jiangtao Ren; Zhengyuan Qiu; Wei Fan; Hong Cheng; S Yu Philip,Abstract Traditionally; feature selection methods work directly on labeled examples.However; the availability of labeled examples cannot be taken for granted for many realworld applications; such as medical diagnosis; forensic science; fraud detection; etc; wherelabeled examples are hard to find. This practical problem calls the need for “semi-supervised feature selection” to choose the optimal set of features given both labeled andunlabeled examples that return the most accurate classifier for a learning algorithm. In thispaper; we introduce a “wrapper-type” forward semi-supervised feature selection framework.In essence; it uses unlabeled examples to extend the initial labeled training set. Extensiveexperiments on publicly available datasets shows that our proposed framework; generally;outperforms both traditional supervised and state-of-the-art “filter-type” semi-supervised …,Pacific-Asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,67

The influence of several processvariables; such as process temperature; initial mole ratio of acetic acid over n-butanol; theratio of the effective membrane area over the volume of reacting mixture and catalystcontent; on the esterification was discussed. The calculated results for the conversion of n-butanol to water and permeation flux were consistence with the experimental data.

The aim is to develop the microphones with high sensitivity and lowfabrication cost. Slotted and corrugated diaphragms have been designed and fabricated inorder to increase the mechanical sensitivity of microphones. At the same time; we developedthe fabrication process for the low stress or stress-free multilayers polysilicon used as themicrophone diaphragms.

Generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns with context analysis,Qiaozhu Mei; Dong Xin; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; ChengXiang Zhai,Abstract As a fundamental data mining task; frequent pattern mining has widespreadapplications in many different domains. Research in frequent pattern mining has so farmostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequentpatterns; but little attention has been paid to the important nextstep-interpreting thediscovered frequent patterns. Although some recent work has studied the compression andsummarization of frequent patterns; the proposed techniques can only annotate a frequentpattern with non-semantical information (eg support); which provides only limited help for auser to understand the patterns. In this paper; we propose the novel problem of generatingsemantic annotations for frequent patterns. The goal is to annotate a frequent pattern with in-depth; concise; and structured information that can better indicate the hidden meanings of …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,65
Observation of Dirac cone warping and chirality effects in silicene,Baojie Feng; Hui Li; Cheng-Cheng Liu; Ting-Na Shao; Peng Cheng; Yugui Yao; Sheng Meng; Lan Chen; Kehui Wu,We performed low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy(STS) studies on the electronic properties of (√ 3×√ 3) R30° phase of silicene on Ag (111)surface. We found the existence of Dirac Fermion chirality through the observation of− 1.5and− 1.0 power law decay of quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns. Moreover; in contrastto the trigonal warping of Dirac cone in graphene; we found that the Dirac cone of silicene ishexagonally warped; which is further confirmed by density functional calculations andexplained by the unique superstructure of silicene. Our results demonstrate that the (√ 3×√3) R30° phase is an ideal system to investigate the unique Dirac Fermion properties ofsilicene.,ACS nano,2013,64

Predicting positive and negative links in signed social networks by transfer learning,Jihang Ye; Hong Cheng; Zhe Zhu; Minghua Chen,Abstract Different from a large body of research on social networks that has focused almostexclusively on positive relationships; we study signed social networks with both positive andnegative links. Specifically; we focus on how to reliably and effectively predict the signs oflinks in a newly formed signed social network (called a target network). Since usually only avery small amount of edge sign information is available in such newly formed networks; thissmall quantity is not adequate to train a good classifier. To address this challenge; we needassistance from an existing; mature signed network (called a source network) which hasabundant edge sign information. We adopt the transfer learning approach to leverage theedge sign information from the source network; which may have a different yet related jointdistribution of the edge instances and their class labels.

Dispersion modeling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from combustion of biomass and fossil fuels and production of coke in Tianjin; China,Shu Tao; Xinrong Li; Yu Yang; Raymond M Coveney; Xiaoxia Lu; Haitao Chen; Weiran Shen,A USEPA; procedure; ISCLT3 (Industrial Source Complex Long-Term); was applied tomodel the spatial distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted fromvarious sources including coal; petroleum; natural gas; and biomass into the atmosphere ofTianjin; China. Benzo [a] pyrene equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) were calculated for riskassessment. Model results were provisionally validated for concentrations and profilesbased on the observed data at two monitoring stations. The dominant emission sources inthe area were domestic coal combustion; coke production; and biomass burning. Mainlybecause of the difference in the emission heights; the contributions of various sources to theaverage concentrations at receptors differ from proportions emitted. The shares of domesticcoal increased from∼ 43% at the sources to 56% at the receptors; while the contributions …,Environmental science & technology,2006,62

Nuclear targeting of transforming growth factor-β-activated Smad complexes,Hong Bing Chen; Jonathan G Rud; Kai Lin; Lan Xu,Abstract Upon stimulation by the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β); Smad2 and Smad3are phosphorylated at their C termini and assemble into stable heteromeric complexes withSmad4. These complexes are the functional entities that translocate into the nucleus andregulate the expression of TGF-β target genes. Here we report that the TGF-β-activatedphospho-Smad3/Smad4 complex utilizes an importin-independent mechanism for nuclearimport and engages different nucleoporins for nuclear import compared with the monomericSmad4. Within the heteromeric complex; phospho-Smad3 appears to dominate over Smad4in the nuclear import process and guides the complex to its nuclear destination. We alsodemonstrate that the binding of phospho-Smad3 to Smad4 prevents Smad4 from interactingwith the nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1.

CdS/CdSe co-sensitized vertically aligned anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays for efficient solar cells,Hua-Shang Rao; Wu-Qiang Wu; Yu Liu; Yang-Fan Xu; Bai-Xue Chen; Hong-Yan Chen; Dai-Bin Kuang; Cheng-Yong Su,Abstract The vertically aligned anatase TiO 2 nanowire arrays with smooth or branchedarchitectures were grown on TCO substrate directly via a simple surfactant-freehydrothermal route. And they were utilized to fabricate efficient quantum-dot sensitized solarcells (QDSSCs) for the first time. The thickness of CdS and CdSe shell were confirmed byhigh-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX). A power conversion efficiency of 4.2%was attained with the hierarchical TiO 2 nanowires based cell; which is 30% higher than thatof smooth nanowires devices due to improved short-circuit current density (J SC) and fillfactor (FF). The increased J SC profits from superior light-scattering ability of branchedhierarchical TiO 2 nanowires for enhanced light-harvesting efficiency and the prominent …,Nano Energy,2014,59

Copper hexacyanoferrate multilayer films on glassy carbon electrode modified with 4-aminobenzoic acid in aqueous solution,Guocheng Yang; Yan Shen; Mingkui Wang; Hongjun Chen; Baifeng Liu; Shaojun Dong,Abstract 4-Aminobenzoic acid (4-ABA) was covalently grafted on a glassy carbon electrode(GCE) by amine cation radical formation during the electrooxidation process in 0.1 M KClaqueous solution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement proves thepresence of 4-carboxylphenylamine on the GCE. Electron transfer processes of Fe (CN) 63− in solutions of various pHs at the modified electrode are studied by both cyclicvoltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Changing thesolution pH would result in the variation of the terminal group's charge state; based on whichthe surface pK a values were estimated. The copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) multilayerfilms were formed on 4-ABA/GCE prepared in aqueous solution; and which exhibit goodelectrochemical behavior with high stability.,Talanta,2006,56
V-val subtype of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 preferentially exists in biopsies of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Xiao-Shi Zhang; Hong-He Wang; Li-Fu Hu; Ang Li; Ru-Hua Zhang; Hai-Qiang Mai; Jian-Chuan Xia; Li-Zheng Chen; Yi-Xin Zeng,Abstract Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been suggested to be involved in pathogenesis ofnasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However; EBV infection is ubiquitous; whereas NPCoccurs with strong geographic and racial distribution. Whether a substrain of EBVcontributes to this phenomenon remains uncertain. Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1(EBNA-1) is one of the most frequently detected EBV proteins in NPC tissues. Based on thepolymorphism of amino acids at position 487; EBNA-1 is classified into five subtypes: P-ala;P-thr; V-val; V-leu and V-pro. To examine the relationship between subtypes of EBNA-1 andNPC; we determined the subtypes of EBNA-1 in biopsies of NPC; peripheral bloodlymphocytes (PBL); and throat washings (TWs) obtained in endemic and non-endemic areasof NPC within China. The results revealed that V-val was the only subtype detected in …,Cancer letters,2004,56
CD133 is a temporary marker of cancer stem cells in small cell lung cancer; but not in non-small cell lung cancer,Fei Cui; Jian Wang; Duan Chen; Yi-Jiang Chen,Abstract Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Currentinvestigations in the field of cancer research have intensively focused on the 'cancer stemcell'or 'tumor-initiating cell'. While CD133 was initially considered as a stem cell marker onlyin the hematopoietic system and the nervous system; the membrane antigen also identifiestumorigenic cells in certain solid tumors. In this study; we investigated the human lungcancer cell lines A549; H157; H226; Calu-1; H292 and H446. The results of real-time PCRanalysis after chemotherapy drug selection and the fluorescence-activated cell sortinganalysis showed that CD133 only functioned as a marker in the small cell lung cancer lineH446. The sorted CD133+ subset presented stem cell-like features; including self-renewal;differentiation; proliferation and tumorigenic capacity in subsequent assays. Furthermore …,Oncology reports,2011,55

Facile fabrication of large area of aggregated gold nanorods film for efficient surface-enhanced Raman scattering,Yuling Wang; Shaojun Guo; Hongjun Chen; Erkang Wang,Abstract An effective and facile method for fabrication of large area of aggregated goldnanorods (AuNRs) film was proposed by self-assembly of AuNRs at a toluene/waterinterface for the first time. It was found that large area of aggregated AuNRs film could beformed at the interface of toluene and water due to the interfacial tension between the twophases. The obtained large area of aggregated AuNRs film exhibits strong surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity with 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) and 2-aminothiophenol (2-ATP) as the probe molecules based on the strong electromagneticcoupling effect between the very adjacent AuNRs. Enhancement factors (EF) were used toestimate the SERS activity of the aggregated AuNRs film; which is obtained to be 1.7× 10 5for 7a vibration of 4-ATP. SERS intensity is compared with AuNRs deposited directly on …,Journal of colloid and interface science,2008,53
Robust reputation-based ranking on bipartite rating networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffery Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,Abstract With the growth of the Internet and E-commerce; bipartite rating networks areubiquitous. In such bipartite rating networks; there exist two types of entities: the users andthe objects; where users give ratings to objects. A fundamental problem in such networks ishow to rank the objects by user's ratings. Although it has been extensively studied in the pastdecade; the existing algorithms either cannot guarantee convergence; or are not robust tothe spammers. In this paper; we propose six new reputation-based algorithms; where theusers' reputation is determined by the aggregated difference between the users' ratings andthe corresponding objects' rankings. We prove that all of our algorithms converge into aunique fixed point. The time and space complexity of our algorithms are linear wrt the size ofthe graph; thus they can be scalable to large datasets. Moreover; our algorithms are …,*,2012,52
Enhanced oncolytic potency of vesicular stomatitis virus through vector-mediated inhibition of NK and NKT cells,Jennifer Altomonte; Lan Wu; Marcia Meseck; Li Chen; Oliver Ebert; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; John Fallon; John Mandeli; Savio LC Woo,Abstract Recombinant oncolytic viruses represent a promising alternative option for thetreatment of malignant cancers. We have reported earlier the safety and efficacy ofrecombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors in a rat model of hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC). However; the full potential of VSV therapy is limited by a sudden declinein intratumoral virus replication observed early after viral administration; a phenomenon thatcoincides with an accumulation of inflammatory cells within infected lesions. To overcomethe antiviral function of these cells; we present a recombinant virus; rVSV-UL141; whichexpresses a protein from human cytomegalovirus known to downregulate the natural killer(NK) cell-activating ligand CD155. The modified vector resulted in an inhibition of NK cellrecruitment in vitro; as well as decreased intratumoral accumulations of NK and NKT cells …,Cancer gene therapy,2009,52
An approach for synthesizing nanometer-to micrometer-sized silver nanoplates,Xiangqin Zou; Erbo Ying; Hongjun Chen; Shaojun Dong,Abstract Silver nanoplates with controlled size are synthesized by seed-mediated growthapproach in the presence of citrate. These nanoplates are single crystal with a mean size of25–1073 nm and thickness of ca. 10–22 nm. The optical in-plane dipole plasmon resonancebands of these plates can be tuned from 458 to 2400 nm. Control experiments have beenexplored for a more thorough understanding of the growth mechanism. It was found that theadditional citrate ions in the growth solution were the key to controlling the aspect ratio ofsilver nanoplates. Similar to the surfactants or polymers in the solution; citrate ions could belikewise dynamically adsorbed on the growing silver nanoparticles and promote the two-dimensional growth of silver nanoparticles under certain conditions. Small silver seeds werealso found to play an important role in the formation of large thin silver nanoplates …,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,2007,52

To answer a shortest distance query; the precomputed distances from thelandmarks to the two query nodes are used to compute an approximate shortest distancebased on the triangle inequality. In this paper; we analyze the factors that affect the accuracyof distance estimation in landmark embedding. In particular; we find that a globally selected;query-independent landmark set may introduce a large relative error; especially for nearbyquery nodes. To address this issue; we propose a query-dependent local landmark scheme;which identifies a local landmark close to both query nodes and provides more accurate …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,49
Self-assembly of TGA-capped CdTe nanocrystals into three-dimensional luminescent nanostructures,Hongjun Chen; Vladimir Lesnyak; Nadja C Bigall; Nikolai Gaponik; Alexander Eychmüller,In this paper; we report on a convenient and quick self-assembly of thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) into three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures in solution; inwhich large-scale nanowires are found as building blocks. The wet 3D nanostructures canbe further dried by critical CO2 to obtain solids with a volume of about 1 cm3 and a density ofabout 1/2500th of bulk CdTe. By SEM; EDS; and HRTEM characterization; it is found that thenanowires actually are CdTe@ Cd− TGA complex hybrid nanostructures in which many well-separated CdTe NCs are uniformly distributed. The hybrid nanowires can reach severalmicrometers in length and 25±8 nm in width. As a result of the CdTe NCs with their integrityand effective protection by the Cd− TGA complex; the hybrid nanowires and 3Dnanostructures still show visually bright luminescence and retain the size-quantized …,Chemistry of Materials,2010,49
Anaerobic metabolism in the roots of seedlings of the invasive exotic Lepidium latifolium,Hongjun Chen; Robert G Qualls,Abstract Lepidium latifolium is an invasive exotic crucifer that is widely distributed in riparianzones and wetlands. In this study; anoxic carbohydrate metabolism and post-anoxic injury inthe roots of L. latifolium seedlings were examined. A significant increase in the activity of thefermentative enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inroots occurred under anoxia and increased with the duration of anaerobic treatment during 7days. However; pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activitywas maintained at relatively stable levels under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Solubleprotein concentration in anoxic roots was two to three times that in aerobic roots throughout7 days of anoxia. The concentration of the fermentation product ethanol in roots was twotimes greater under anoxia than under aerobic conditions.

Experimental validation of critical temperature-pressure theory of scuffing,Si C Lee; Huanliang Chen,A series of experiments was conducted for validating a newly developed theory of scuffing.The Critical Temperature-Pressure (CTP) theory is based on the physisorption behavior oflubricants and is capable of predicting the onset of scuffing failures over a wide range ofoperating conditions; including the contacts operating in the boundary lubrication and in thepartial elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regimes. According to the CTP theory; failuresoccur when the contact temperature exceeds a certain critical value which is a function of thelubricant pressure generated by the hydrodynamic action of the EHL contact. A specialdevice capable of simulating the ambient conditions of the partial EHL conjunctions (ofcontact temperature; pressure; and the lubricant pressure) was constructed.

A surfactant-free strategy for synthesizing and processing intermetallic platinum-based nanoparticle catalysts,Hao Chen; Deli Wang; Yingchao Yu; Kathryn A Newton; David A Muller; Héctor Abruña; Francis J DiSalvo,Using Pt3Fe nanoparticles as an example; a surfactant-free Np-KCl matrix method (Npstands for nanoparticle) is developed for the synthesis of nanoparticles with controlled sizeand structure. In this method; the Np-KCl assembly is formed in a one-pot reduction in THFat room temperature. KCl is an insoluble byproduct of the reaction and serves as a matrixthat traps the nanoparticles to avoid particle agglomeration and to control the coalescence ofnanoparticles during thermal annealing up to 600° C. By varying the molar ratio of metalprecursors and KCl; as well as the time and temperature of annealing; the final particle sizesand crystalline order can be independently controlled. After thermal processing;nanoparticles were released from the KCl matrix and transferred in an ethylene glycol–watersolution to support materials forming a uniform Np-support assembly.

Rejection of metastatic 4T1 breast cancer by attenuation of Treg cells in combination with immune stimulation,Li Chen; Tian-Gui Huang; Marcia Meseck; John Mandeli; John Fallon; Savio LC Woo,4T1 breast carcinoma is a highly malignant and poorly immunogenic murine tumor modelthat resembles advanced breast cancer in humans; and is refractory to most immunestimulation-based treatments. We hypothesize that the ineffectiveness of immune stimulatorytreatment is mediated by the suppressive effects of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells;which can be attenuated by engaging the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factorreceptor family-related protein with its natural ligand (GITRL); further; combination treatmentwith existing immune stimulation regimens will augment anti-tumor immunity and eradicatemetastatic 4T1 tumors in mice.

Fabrication of UV-crosslinked chitosan scaffolds with conjugation of RGD peptides for bone tissue engineering,Wei-Bor Tsai; Yi-Ru Chen; Hsuan-Liang Liu; Juin-Yih Lai,Abstract In this study; a simple process was established to fabricate RGD-conjugated andcrosslinked chitosan scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Two types of chitosan derivativeswere synthesized: one containing photoreactive azido groups and the other tethered withRGD. Their mixture was fabricated into chitosan scaffolds by freeze-drying and UVcrosslinking. The pore size and mechanical property of the chitosan scaffolds wereincreased by 1.36 and 2.41 folds; respectively; by the post-crosslinking process.Incorporation of RGD enhanced the culture of the rat primary osteoblasts. After 10 days ofculture; the cell number in the RGD-contained chitosan scaffolds was increased by 50%compared to the control. Furthermore; the calcium deposition by the osteoblasts in the RGD-incorporated chitosan scaffolds was almost doubled compared to the control; and thus …,Carbohydrate polymers,2011,42
Discriminative frequent subgraph mining with optimality guarantees,Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Jiawei Han; Hans‐Peter Kriegel; Alex Smola; Le Song; Philip S Yu; Xifeng Yan; Karsten M Borgwardt,Abstract The goal of frequent subgraph mining is to detect subgraphs that frequently occur ina dataset of graphs. In classification settings; one is often interested in discoveringdiscriminative frequent subgraphs; whose presence or absence is indicative of the classmembership of a graph. In this article; we propose an approach to feature selection onfrequent subgraphs; called CORK; that combines two central advantages. First; it optimizes asubmodular quality criterion; which means that we can yield a near-optimal solution usinggreedy feature selection. Second; our submodular quality function criterion can beintegrated into gSpan; the state-of-the-art tool for frequent subgraph mining; and help toprune the search space for discriminative frequent subgraphs even during frequentsubgraph mining.

Self-Assembly of Ionic Liquids-Stabilized Pt Nanoparticles into Two-Dimensional Patterned Nanostructures at the Air− Water Interface,Hongjun Chen; Shaojun Dong,In this paper; we demonstrate the self-assembly of ionic liquids (ILs)-stabilized Ptnanoparticles into two-dimensional (2D) patterned nanostructures at the air− water interfaceunder ambient conditions. Here; ILs are not used as solvents but as mediators by virtue oftheir pronounced self-organization ability in synthesis of self-assembled; highly organizedhybrid Pt nanostructures. It is also found that the morphologies of the 2D patternednanostructures are directly connected with the quantities of ILs. Due to the special structuresof ILs-stabilized Pt nanoparticles; 2D patterned Pt nanostructures can be formed through theπ− π stack interactions and hydrogen bonds. The resulting 2D patterned Pt nanostructuresexhibit good electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction.,Langmuir,2007,42
Study of buoyancy-induced flows subjected to partially heated sources on the left and bottom walls in a square enclosure,Tzong-Huei Chen; Li-Yueh Chen,Abstract In this paper; numerical simulations of laminar; steady; two-dimensional naturalconvection flows in a square enclosure with discrete heat sources on the left and bottomwalls are presented using a finite-volume method. Two different orientated wall boundaryconditions are designed to investigate the natural convection features. The computationalresults are expressed in the form of streamlines and isothermal lines for Rayleigh numbersranging from 10 2 to 10 7 in the cavity. In the course of study; a combination of third-orderand exponential interpolating profile based on the convective boundedness criterion isproposed and tested against the partially heated cavity flow up to the highest Rayleighnumber 10 7. The effects of thermal strength and heating length on the hydrodynamic andthermal fields inside the enclosure are also presented.

Partial paramagnetism of the chromium-chromium quadruple bond,F Albert Cotton; Hong Chen; Lee M Daniels; Xuejun Feng,Abstract: Variable-temperature NMR measurements show that Cr2 (02CR); L2 compounds(L= MeOH; H20; py; MeCN) and closely related on= possess inherent; temperature-dependent partial paramagnetism. This may be attributed to a Boltzmann distributionbetween a ground state with S= 0 and a low-lying (-400-1000 cm-I) state with S= 1. When Ris kept constant (as CHI) and the Cr-Cr distance is changed by changing L; the singlet-tripletseparation varies inversely with the Cr-Cr distance; suggesting that the low-lying triplet statemay be the 3A2u state arising from a dr4r466* configuration. Other explanations may alsobe considered; and cannot be falsified conclusively. The carbamato compound Cr2(02CNEt2) 4 (NEt2H) 2 has also been studied. Despite the fact that the Cr-Cr distance issimilar to those in the acetates; the singlet-triplet gap is much smaller; ca. 600 cm-I. This …,Journal of the American Chemical Society,1992,42
Forest of gold nanowires: A new type of nanocrystal growth,Jiating He; Yawen Wang; Yuhua Feng; Xiaoying Qi; Zhiyuan Zeng; Qing Liu; Wei Shan Teo; Chee Lip Gan; Hua Zhang; Hongyu Chen,We report a nanowire growth that is highly unconventional:(1) nanowires can grow fromsubstrate-bound seeds but cannot from colloidal seeds under otherwise the sameconditions;(2) the nanowires grow from only one side of the seeds; with their diameterindependent of the size of the seeds; and (3) vertically aligned ultrathin nanowires areobtained on substrates; using aqueous solution and ambient conditions. With carefullydesigned experiments; we propose and test a new mechanism that can explain theseunusual phenonmena. It turns out that the strong binding of ligands in this system forcesselective deposition of Au at the ligand-deficient interface between Au seeds and oxidesubstrates. This means of promoting anisotropic growth of nanocrystals into nanowires ispreviously unknown in the literature. We are able to pinpoint the site of active growth and …,ACS nano,2013,41
Hadamard transform combined with companding transform technique for PAPR reduction in an optical direct-detection OFDM system,Jiangnan Xiao; Jianjun Yu; Xinying Li; Qi Tang; Hongxian Chen; Fan Li; Zizheng Cao; Lin Chen,In this paper; we propose a novel method to reduce the high peak-to-average power ratio(PAPR) of the optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The methodis based on the technique of the Hadamard transform combined with a compandingtransform. We experimentally demonstrate that; in an optical intensity-modulation direct-detection OFDM transmission system; the hybrid method has better performance in reducingthe PAPR compared with the case of applying only the Hadamard transform or only acompanding transform.,IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking,2012,41
The Batten disease gene CLN3 is required for the response to oxidative stress,Richard I Tuxworth; Haiyang Chen; Valerie Vivancos; Nancy Carvajal; Xun Huang; Guy Tear,Abstract Mutations in the CLN3 gene cause juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL orBatten disease); an early onset neurodegenerative disorder. JNCL is the most common ofthe NCLs; a group of disorders with infant or childhood onset that are caused by single genemutations. The NCLs; although relatively rare; share many pathological and clinicalsimilarities with the more common late-onset neurodegenerative disorders; while theirsimple genetic basis makes them an excellent paradigm. The early onset and rapid diseaseprogression in the NCLs suggests that one or more key cellular processes are severelycompromised. To identify the functional pathways compromised in JNCL; we haveperformed a gain-of-function modifier screen in Drosophila. We find that CLN3 interactsgenetically with the core stress signalling pathways and components of stress granules …,Human molecular genetics,2011,41

The combined effect of low frequency ultrasound (20 kHz) andenhancers on the indomethacin permeation was also evaluated. The experimental datademonstrated that capsaicin and nonivamide significantly enhanced the flux ofindomethacin across nude mouse skin. Enhancement effects of both analogues were verysimilar and depended predominantly on the concentration tested. Histological examinationcoupled with visual scores indicated the safety of capsaicin and nonivamide on skinstructure. Simultaneous application of ultrasound and enhancers significantly increased skinpermeation of indomethacin compared with either ultrasound or enhancers alone.

An information-gain approach to detecting three-way epistatic interactions in genetic association studies,Ting Hu; Yuanzhu Chen; Jeff W Kiralis; Ryan L Collins; Christian Wejse; Giorgio Sirugo; Scott M Williams; Jason H Moore,Abstract Background Epistasis has been historically used to describe the phenomenon thatthe effect of a given gene on a phenotype can be dependent on one or more other genes;and is an essential element for understanding the association between genetic andphenotypic variations. Quantifying epistasis of orders higher than two is very challengingdue to both the computational complexity of enumerating all possible combinations ingenome-wide data and the lack of efficient and effective methodologies. Objectives In thisstudy; we propose a fast; non-parametric; and model-free measure for three-way epistasis.Methods Such a measure is based on information gain; and is able to separate all lowerorder effects from pure three-way epistasis.

Ac-close: Efficiently mining approximate closed itemsets by core pattern recovery,Hong Cheng; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Recent studies have proposed methods to discover approximate frequent itemsets in thepresence of random noise. By relaxing the rigid requirement of exact frequent patternmining; some interesting patterns; which would previously be fragmented by exact patternmining methods due to the random noise or measurement error; are successfully recovered.Unfortunately; a large number of" uninteresting" candidates are explored as well during themining process; as a result of the relaxed pattern mining methodology. This severely slowsdown the mining process. Even worse; it is hard for an end user to distinguish the recoveredinteresting patterns from these uninteresting ones. In this paper; we propose an efficientalgorithm AC-Close to recover the approximate closed itemsets from" core patterns".

Differential expression of RANTES chemokine; TGF-β; and leukocyte phenotype in acute cellular rejection and quilty B lesions,Paul J Michaels; Jon Kobashigawa; Hillel Laks; Amir Azarbal; Maria L Espejo; Leslie Chen; Michael C Fishbein,Abstract Background Because of the complexity of the trabeculated endocardial surface andtangential histologic sectioning; the differentiation of acute cellular rejection (ACR) fromQuilty B lesions (QB) in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) is problematic. We hypothesizedthat the phenotype chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation; normal T cell expressedand secreted) expression of infiltrating cells and the pattern of expression of transforminggrowth factor–β (TGF-β) may distinguish ACR from QB. In previous studies; the number ofRANTES-positive cells and the expression of TGF-β correlated with the severity of rejection.Methods We used immunohistochemical techniques to stain sections of human EMBs withonly QB (n= 14) or with only ACR (International Society for Heart and Lung TransplantationGrades 1A and 1B; n= 7; Grades 3A and 3B; n= 7) for B (CD20) and T-lymphocytes (CD3) …,The Journal of heart and lung transplantation,2001,39
Production of black carbon-like and aliphatic molecules from terrestrial dissolved organic matter in the presence of sunlight and iron,Hongmei Chen; Hussain AN Abdulla; Rebecca L Sanders; Satish CB Myneni; Kenneth Mopper; Patrick G Hatcher,Photochemical processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural waters can alter itscomposition and structure; supply particulate organic matter (POM) to sediments; and delivermodified terrestrial DOM to the ocean. Our studies show that terrestrial DOM exposed tosimulated sunlight is altered to produce POM with a markedly different molecularcomposition enriched with newly formed aliphatic and condensed aromatic molecules. Thisprocess is closely tied to the chemistry of iron; which primarily exists as dissolved Fe (II) andFe (III)–organic complexes in initial DOM and photochemically matures to Fe (III)oxyhydroxides before coprecipitating out with POM. The newly formed condensed aromaticcompounds resemble black carbon; which until now was thought to be produced by onlycombustion.

K-reach: who is in your small world,James Cheng; Zechao Shang; Hong Cheng; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We study the problem of answering k-hop reachability queries in a directed graph;ie; whether there exists a directed path of length k; from a source query vertex to a targetquery vertex in the input graph. The problem of k-hop reachability is a general problem ofthe classic reachability (where k=∞). Existing indexes for processing classic reachabilityqueries; as well as for processing shortest path queries; are not applicable or not efficient forprocessing k-hop reachability queries. We propose an index for processing k-hopreachability queries; which is simple in design and efficient to construct. Our experimentalresults on a wide range of real datasets show that our index is more efficient than the state-of-the-art indexes even for processing classic reachability queries; for which these indexes areprimarily designed.

Finding top-k similar graphs in graph databases,Yuanyuan Zhu; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Querying similar graphs in graph databases has been widely studied in graphquery processing in recent years. Existing works mainly focus on subgraph similarity searchand supergraph similarity search. In this paper; we study the problem of finding top-k graphsin a graph database that are most similar to a query graph. This problem has manyapplications; such as image retrieval and chemical compound structure search. Regardingthe similarity measure; feature based and kernel based similarity measures have been usedin the literature. But such measures are rough and may lose the connectivity informationamong substructures. In this paper; we introduce a new similarity measure based on themaximum common subgraph (MCS) of two graphs. We show that this measure can bettercapture the common and different structures of two graphs.

Retracted: CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling in spinal glia induces pain hypersensitivity through MAPKs‐mediated neuroinflammation in bone cancer rats,Xue‐Ming Hu; Yan‐Nan Liu; Hai‐Long Zhang; Shou‐Bin Cao; Ting Zhang; Li‐Ping Chen; Wen Shen,Abstract The activation of MAPK pathways in spinal cord and subsequent production ofproinflammatory cytokines in glial cells contribute to the development of spinal centralsensitization; the basic mechanism underlying bone cancer pain (BCP). Our previous studyshowed that spinal CXCL12 from astrocytes mediates BCP generation by binding to CXCR4in both astrocyters and microglia. Here; we verified that CXCL12/CXCR4 signalingcontributed to BCP through a MAPK-mediated mechanism. In naïve rats; a single intrathecaladministration of CXCL12 considerably induced pain hyperalgesia and phosphorylationexpression of spinal MAPK members (including extracellular signal-regulated kinase; p38;and c-Jun N-terminal kinase); which could be partially prevented by pre-treatment withCXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100. This CXCL12-induced hyperalgesia was also reduced by …,Journal of neurochemistry,2015,37
Analysis of rapidly synthesized guest-filled porous complexes with synchrotron radiation: practical guidelines for the crystalline sponge method,Timothy R Ramadhar; S-L Zheng; Y-S Chen; Jon Clardy,A detailed set of synthetic and crystallographic guidelines for the crystalline sponge methodbased upon the analysis of expediently synthesized crystal sponges using third-generationsynchrotron radiation are reported. The procedure for the synthesis of the zinc-based metal–organic framework used in initial crystal sponge reports has been modified to yieldcompetent crystals in 3 days instead of 2 weeks. These crystal sponges were tested onsome small molecules; with two being unexpectedly difficult cases for analysis with in-housediffractometers in regard to data quality and proper space-group determination. Theseissues were easily resolved by the use of synchrotron radiation using data-collection timesof less than an hour.

Germline stem cell gene PIWIL2 mediates DNA repair through relaxation of chromatin,De-Tao Yin; Qien Wang; Li Chen; Meng-Yao Liu; Chunhua Han; Qingtao Yan; Rulong Shen; Gang He; Wenrui Duan; Jian-Jian Li; Altaf Wani; Jian-Xin Gao,DNA damage response (DDR) is an intrinsic barrier of cell to tumorigenesis initiated bygenotoxic agents. However; the mechanisms underlying the DDR are not completelyunderstood despite of extensive investigation.

Preparation and oxidation of an Y2O3-dispersed chromizing coating by pack cementation at 800° C,YB Zhou; H Chen; H Zhang; Y Wang,Abstract Preparation and oxidation of an Y 2 O 3-dispersed chromizing coating wasinvestigated by chromizing an as-electrodeposited Ni–Y 2 O 3 composite film using aconventional pack-cementation method but at a greatly decreased temperature (800° C). Forcomparison; chromizing was also performed in the same condition on an as-deposited Nifilm without Y 2 O 3 particles. Oxidation at 900° C indicated that compared to the Y 2 O 3-freechromizing coating; the Y 2 O 3-dispersed chromizing coating exhibited an increasedoxidation resistance; due to the formation of purer and denser chromia scale. The Y 2 O 3effects on the coating formation and the coating oxidation behavior are discussed in detail.,Vacuum,2008,37

It wasfound that silver clusters could be formed on a layer of positively charged poly (diallyldimethylammonium)(PDDA) anchored to a carbon surface by 4-aminobenzoic acidwhen a drop containing silver nanoparticles was deposited on it. The characteristics of theobtained silver clusters have been investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM); SERSand an SERS-based Raman mapping technique in the form of line scanning. The AFMimage shows that the silver clusters consist of several silver nanoparticles and the size of theclusters is in the range 80–100 nm.

Human neural precursor cells promote neurologic recovery in a viral model of multiple sclerosis,Lu Chen; Ronald Coleman; Ronika Leang; Ha Tran; Alexandra Kopf; Craig M Walsh; Ilse Sears-Kraxberger; Oswald Steward; Wendy B Macklin; Jeanne F Loring; Thomas E Lane,Summary Using a viral model of the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS); we showthat intraspinal transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells(hNPCs) results in sustained clinical recovery; although hNPCs were not detectable beyondday 8 posttransplantation. Improved motor skills were associated with a reduction inneuroinflammation; decreased demyelination; and enhanced remyelination. Evidenceindicates that the reduced neuroinflammation is correlated with an increased number ofCD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords. Coculture of hNPCswith activated T cells resulted in reduced T cell proliferation and increased Treg numbers.The hNPCs acted; in part; through secretion of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. These findings indicatethat the transient presence of hNPCs transplanted in an animal model of MS has powerful …,Stem cell reports,2014,36

Vitamin K does not prevent soft tissue mineralization in a mouse model of pseudoxanthoma elasticum,Christopher Brampton; Yukiko Yamaguchi; Olivier Vanakker; Lut Van Laer; Li-Hsieh Chen; Manoj Thakore; Anne De Paepe; Viola Pomozi; Pál T Szabó; Ludovic Martin; András Váradi; Olivier Le Saux,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable disease characterized by calcified elasticfibers in cutaneous; ocular; and vascular tissues. PXE is caused by mutations in ABCC6;which encodes a protein of the ATP-driven organic anion transporter family. The inability ofthis transporter to secrete its substrate into the circulation is the likely cause of PXE. VitaminK plays a role in the regulation of mineralization processes as a co-factor in thecarboxylation of calcification inhibitors such as Matrix Gla Protein (MGP). Vitamin Kprecursor or a conjugated form has been proposed as potential substrate (s) for ABCC6.

Carbon nanotube composite films with switchable transparency,Fancheng Meng; Xiaohua Zhang; Geng Xu; Zhenzhong Yong; Hongyuan Chen; Minghai Chen; Qingwen Li; Yuntian Zhu,A composite film with switchable transparency is fabricated by sandwiching a carbonnanotube (CNT) sheet within polyurethane (PU) films. The introduction of CNTs not onlymakes the composite film electrically conductive but also induces a rapid crystal melting ofsoft segments in the PU. As a result; the film can be switched from opaque to transparent injust several seconds after turning on voltage; and reversed back to opaque after turning offvoltage. The film also possesses several other attractive properties; including excellentflexibility; low energy consumption; switching speed insensitivity to ambient temperature;and easy coloration; which make the film promising for a wide variety of practicalapplications.,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2011,36

Chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose polyelectrolyte complex scaffolds for pulp cells regeneration,Huangqin Chen; Mingwen Fan,Novel polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) chitosan/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) scaffolds areprepared using a freeze-dry process. The microstructure is characterized by SEM and theaverage pore diameters and internal porosities are calculated. The morphology anddistribution of pulp cells on these three-dimensional scaffolds are investigated by SEM andconfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The expression of osteonectin (ON) and dentinsialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The scaffolds are then implanted subcutaneously into BALB/c mice. The additionof CMC to chitosan decreases the pore diameter and increases internal porosity. The pulpcells co-cultured in these PEC scaffolds show improved adhesion; spreading; cell capacity;and three-dimensional configurations compared to pure chitosan scaffolds.

However;the response rate to trastuzumab among the patients is low. The molecular mechanismsunderlying trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer are unknown. Our in vitro data show thatactivation of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) triggered by catecholamine caused “targetingfailure” of trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells. The antitumor activities of trastuzumab weresignificantly impeded by chronic catecholamine stimulation in gastric cancer cells and in themice bearing human gastric cancer xenografts. Mechanistically; catecholamine inducedupregulation of the MUC4 expression at both transcription and protein levels via activatingSTAT3 and ERK. The effects of catecholamine could be effectively blocked by β2-ARantagonist ICI-118;551; indicating that β2-AR–mediated signaling pathway plays a key …,The Journal of Immunology,2013,35

Disturbance attenuation control of active suspension with non-linear actuator dynamics,M-M Ma; H Chen,This study suggests an approach to design an active suspension controller with non-linearactuator dynamics; which can achieve good ride comfort while respecting safety constraintssuch as road holding and limited suspension strokes. The procedure includes two steps:design a state feedback ℋ∞ controller for the linear subsystem with time-domain constraints;and then apply the backstepping technique to deal with non-linear actuator dynamics and toderive the control law. The closed-loop system achieves a bounded disturbance attenuationlevel (the l2 gain); which gives a measure of ride comfort in the case of general roaddisturbances. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the designedcontroller.,IET control theory & applications,2011,35

On compressing frequent patterns,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng,Abstract A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results.To compress the frequent patterns; we propose to cluster frequent patterns with a tightnessmeasure δ (called δ-cluster); and select a representative pattern for each cluster. Theproblem of finding a minimum set of representative patterns is shown NP-Hard. We developtwo greedy methods; RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compressionbound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds butis far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality usingRPlocal is very close to RPglobal; and both can reduce the number of closed frequentpatterns by almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore; RPlocal mines even faster thanFPClose [G. Grahne; J. Zhu; Efficiently using prefix-trees in mining frequent itemsets; in …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,35

In air-saturatedstrong alkaline solution three ECL processes were obtained at− 1.2;+ 1.34 and+ 1.75 Vversus Ag/AgCl without adding any special coreactants. The different ECL processesresulted from the electron transfer reactions between positively or negatively charged CdSeHSAs and some electrogenerated species. Selective quench of the anodic and cathodicECL processes were achieved by controlling the solution pH value or the concentration ofdissolved oxygen. Comparing the ECL processes of the entrapped CdSe nanocrystals withthe entrapped HSAs; the architecture of the HSAs showed important effects on their ECLbehaviors.

Graph classification: a diversified discriminative feature selection approach,Yuanyuan Zhu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng; Lu Qin,Abstract A graph models complex structural relationships among objects; and has beenprevalently used in a wide range of applications. Building an automated graph classificationmodel becomes very important for predicting unknown graphs or understanding complexstructures between different classes. The graph classification framework being widely usedconsists of two steps; namely; feature selection and classification. The key issue is how toselect important subgraph features from a graph database with a large number of graphsincluding positive graphs and negative graphs. Given the features selected; a genericclassification approach can be used to build a classification model. In this paper; we focuson feature selection. We identify two main issues with the most widely used feature selectionapproach which is based on a discriminative score to select frequent subgraph features …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,32

Genetic differentiation in populations of Drosophila melanogaster from the Peoples' Republic of China: comparison with patterns on other continents,Chengshan Jiang; John B Gibson; Huazhong Chen,Abstract Geographic variation at eight allozyme loci in eight natural populations ofDrosophila melanogaster from the People's Republic of China (PRC) was collated with datafrom Japanese populations and compared with previous reports for other continents. G6pdF; Est-6 1· 00 and Adh s were significantly correlated with latitude. Whilst the variation in Est-6 1· 00 was opposite to that previously reported; Adh s showed latitudinal clines consistentwith data from the northern and southern hemispheres. A thermostable variant; Adh FChD;was found at high frequency in the southern PRC populations and it is suggested that themutation occurred in this region and was then dispersed to other continents.,Heredity,1989,31
Experimental study on improving the efficiency of dust removers by using acoustic agglomeration as pretreatment,Dong Zhou; Zhongyang Luo; Jianping Jiang; Hao Chen; Mengshi Lu; Mengxiang Fang,Abstract Fine particles are significantly harmful to the human body and the atmosphericenvironment. However; the efficiency of current conventional dust removal devices for PM2.5 is low. Acoustic agglomeration is a promising pretreatment technology; which uses high-intensity sound wave to induce particles to agglomerate and improves the efficiency ofconventional dust removal devices. In this study; an experimental setup of acousticagglomeration was built and connected to an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and a bag filter.The influence of acoustic agglomeration on dust removal efficiency was investigated.Results show that acoustic agglomeration has a significant positive effect on improving thedust removal efficiency of the ESP and bag filter. The removal efficiency increases with theincrease in sound pressure level. The optimal frequencies or frequency ranges that are …,Powder Technology,2016,30

The dual-sparse topic model: mining focused topics and focused terms in short text,Tianyi Lin; Wentao Tian; Qiaozhu Mei; Hong Cheng,Abstract Topic modeling has been proved to be an effective method for exploratory textmining. It is a common assumption of most topic models that a document is generated from amixture of topics. In real-world scenarios; individual documents usually concentrate onseveral salient topics instead of covering a wide variety of topics. A real topic also adopts anarrow range of terms instead of a wide coverage of the vocabulary. Understanding thissparsity of information is especially important for analyzing user-generated Web content andsocial media; which are featured as extremely short posts and condensed discussions. Inthis paper; we propose a dual-sparse topic model that addresses the sparsity in both thetopic mixtures and the word usage. By applying a" Spike and Slab" prior to decouple thesparsity and smoothness of the document-topic and topic-word distributions; we allow …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,2014,30
Novel molecular-level evidence of iodine binding to natural organic matter from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry,Chen Xu; Hongmei Chen; Yuko Sugiyama; Saijin Zhang; Hsiu-Ping Li; Yi-Fang Ho; Chia-ying Chuang; Kathleen A Schwehr; Daniel I Kaplan; Chris Yeager; Kimberly A Roberts; Patrick G Hatcher; Peter H Santschi,Abstract Major fractions of radioiodine (129 I) are associated with natural organic matter(NOM) in the groundwater and surface soils of the Savannah River Site (SRS). Electrosprayionization coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) was applied to elucidate the interactions between inorganic iodine species(iodide and iodate) and a fulvic acid (FA) extracted from a SRS surface soil. Iodate is likelyreduced to reactive iodine species by the lignin-and tannin-like compounds or the carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM); during which condensed aromatics and lignin-likecompounds were generated. Iodide is catalytically oxidized into reactive iodine species byperoxides; while FA is oxidized by peroxides into more aliphatic and less aromaticcompounds.

Histone acetyltransferase PCAF regulates inflammatory molecules in the development of renal injury,Jin Huang; Danyang Wan; Jianshuang Li; Hong Chen; Kun Huang; Ling Zheng,Kidney diseases; including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI); areassociated with inflammation. The mechanism that regulates inflammation in these renalinjuries remains unclear. Here; we demonstrated that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF); ahistone acetyltransferase; was overexpressed in the kidneys of db/db mice andlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice. Moreover; elevated histone acetylation; such asH3K18ac; and up-regulation of some inflammatory genes; such as ICAM-1; VCAM-1; andMCP-1; were found upon these renal injuries. Furthermore; increased H3K18ac wasrecruited to the promoters of ICAM-1; VCAM-1; and MCP-1 in the kidneys of LPS-injectedmice. In vitro studies demonstrated that PCAF knockdown in human renal proximal tubuleepithelial cells (HK-2) led to downregulation of inflammatory molecules; including VCAM …,Epigenetics,2015,29

Inferring protein function by domain context similarities in protein-protein interaction networks,Song Zhang; Hu Chen; Ke Liu; Zhirong Sun,Genome sequencing projects generate massive amounts of sequence data but there are stillmany proteins whose functions remain unknown. The availability of large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to develop new function prediction methodsbased on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Although several existing methodscombine multiple information resources; there is no study that integrates protein domaininformation and PPI networks to predict protein functions. The domain context similarity canbe a useful index to predict protein function similarity. The prediction accuracy of our methodin yeast is between 63%-67%; which outperforms the other methods in terms of ROC curves.This paper presents a novel protein function prediction method that combines proteindomain composition information and PPI networks.

Integrated control of in-wheel motor electric vehicles using a triple-step nonlinear method,Haiyan Zhao; Bingzhao Gao; Bingtao Ren; Hong Chen,Abstract To improve the vehicle stability of an electric vehicle with four in-wheel motors; anintegrated control scheme with active front wheel steering and direct yaw moment isproposed using a triple-step nonlinear method. The method handles the nonlinear tirecharacteristics explicitly and actualizes a decoupling control for the considered two-input two-output nonlinear system; in the sense that the closed-loop error dynamics evolveindependently. The design procedure is formalized as a triple-step deduction; and thederived controller consists of three parts: steady-state-like control; feedforward controlconsidering reference variations; and state-dependent error feedback control. Finally; thedesigned controller is evaluated in a realistic seven DOF vehicle model and results aresatisfying.,Journal of the Franklin Institute,2015,28
Why fine tree roots are stronger than thicker roots: The role of cellulose and lignin in relation to slope stability,Chao-Bo Zhang; Li-Hua Chen; Jing Jiang,Abstract Plant roots help to reinforce the soil; increase slope stability and decrease watererosion. Root tensile strength plays an important role in soil reinforcement and slopestabilization. The relationship between tensile strength and internal chemical composition ofroots is unknown due to limited studies. Thus; it is difficult to determine why root tensilestrength tends to decrease with increasing root diameter. In this study; biomechanical andbiochemical tests were performed on the roots of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) todetermine the relationships among tensile strength and the contents of the main chemicalcomposition: cellulose; alpha-cellulose and lignin in the roots with different diameters. Ourresults confirmed that the tensile strength of Chinese pine roots decreased with increasingroot diameter; and this relationship might be a power function.

A survey and tutorial on low-complexity turbo coding techniques and a holistic hybrid ARQ design example,Hong Chen; Robert G Maunder; Lajos Hanzo,Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) has become an essential error control techniquein communication networks; which relies on a combination of arbitrary error correction codesand retransmissions. When combining turbo codes with HARQ; the associated complexitybecomes a critical issue; since conventionally iterative decoding is immediately activatedafter each transmission; even though the iterative decoder might fail in delivering an error-free codeword even after a high number of iterations. In this scenario; precious battery-power would be wasted. In order to reduce the associated complexity; we will presentdesign examples based on Multiple Components Turbo Codes (MCTCs) and demonstratethat they are capable of achieving an excellent performance based on the lowest possiblememory octally represented generator polynomial (2; 3) o.

Coverage-based search result diversification,Wei Zheng; Xuanhui Wang; Hui Fang; Hong Cheng,Abstract Traditional retrieval models may provide users with less satisfactory searchexperience because documents are scored independently and the top ranked documentsoften contain excessively redundant information. Intuitively; it is more desirable to diversifysearch results so that the top-ranked documents can cover different query subtopics; ie;different pieces of relevant information. In this paper; we study the problem of search resultdiversification in an optimization framework whose objective is to maximize a coverage-based diversity function. We first define the diversity score of a set of search results throughmeasuring the coverage of query subtopics in the result set; and then discuss how to usethem to derive diversification methods. The key challenge here is how to define anappropriate coverage function given a query and a set of search results. To address this …,Information Retrieval,2012,28

Internal threats avoiding based forwarding protocol in social selfish delay tolerant networks,Xin Guan; Cong Liu; Min Chen; Hongyang Chen; Tomoaki Ohtsuki,In traditional delay tolerant networks (DTNs); there exists a potential assumption that thenodes are willing to help others for packet forwarding. However; in the real applicationscenarios; such as civilian DTNs; selfish behaviors always widely exist. Therefore; theassumption that nodes are cooperative is not realistic in all applications. Currently; most ofthe existing incentive mechanism focuses on individual selfish behaviors. Few researchwork is proposed on social selfish behavior in DTNs. In this paper; we stimulate the nodes tocooperate with others by using a virtual bank mechanism. This incentive mechanism caneffectively avoid individual selfish behaviors. Meanwhile; we observe that under thisindividual selfish incentive mechanism; the social distribution is unfair. That means thepoverty nodes would appear in the networks; and become the internal threats for the …,Communications (ICC); 2011 IEEE international conference on,2011,28

A major role of PKC θ and NFκB in the regulation of hTERT in human T lymphocytes,Wei-Yun Sheng; Yi-Ru Chen; Tzu-Chien V Wang,Abstract Expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) is the rate-limitingdeterminant of telomerase activity in most human cells. In this work; we examined theparticipation of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of hTERT expression in human Tlymphocytes. Transient expression assays using luciferase reporter plasmids containinghTERT promoter showed that overexpression of PKC θ; but not the other PKC isoforms;could activate the promoter activity of hTERT in resting T lymphocytes. Among the PKC θ-activated signalings; we presented evidence that the expression of hTERT is mediatedthrough NFκB but not through MEK or c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Analysis of thehTERT promoter occupancy in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays; however;did not detect an increased binding of NFκB to the hTERT promoter in the activated T …,FEBS letters,2006,28

Control of stress in highly doped polysilicon multi-layer diaphragm structure,Longqing Chen; Jianmin Miao; Lihui Guo; Rongming Lin,Abstract Polysilicon films can be used as stress regulating (or compensating) films toachieve zero resultant stress or low resultant tensile stress in a multi-layer diaphragmstructure. Influence of LPCVD deposition condition; substrate; film thickness; crystallizeddegree and pre-annealing on residual stress in LPCVD polysilicon films was studied. Thepolysilicon deposited on PSG substrate shows the lowest residual stress. The relationshipbetween crystallized degree of polysilicon films and the film thickness was investigated withthe aid of Raman Scattering Spectrometry. The residual stress shows a significantdependence on the film thickness because the crystallized degree raises with the filmthickness. The test results show that:(1) for a thinner film (0.20 μm); even if a higherdeposition temperature is used (630° C); its crystallized degree is still quite low and a …,Surface and Coatings Technology,2001,28
Comparison of the punch-through and non-punch-through IGT structures,Hamza Yilmaz; John L Benjamin; Raymond F Dyer; Li-Shu S Chen; W Ron Van Dell; George C Pifer,The insulated gate transistor (IGT) has been modeled as a wide-base bipolar junctiontransistor (BJT) driven by a MOSFET. Therefore; the vertical wide-base BJT structureinfluences the following IGT characteristics: 1) the forward current-voltage characteristics; 2)the fall time/forward-voltage drop trade-offs; 3) the high-temperature blocking; and 4) the turn-off current tail. An IGT with punch-through (PT) BJT yields lower forward voltage than that ofan IGT with non-punch-through (NPT) BJT due to the thinner base of the PT BJT structure.The punch-through IGT has lower off-state (leakage) current and also shorter turn-off currenttail due to lower current gain of a PT BJT than that of an NPT BJT. Both PT and NPT IGT'shave large safe operation areas.,IEEE transactions on industry applications,1986,28

Generalized higher-order orthogonal iteration for tensor decomposition and completion,Yuanyuan Liu; Fanhua Shang; Wei Fan; James Cheng; Hong Cheng,Abstract Low-rank tensor estimation has been frequently applied in many real-worldproblems. Despite successful applications; existing Schatten 1-norm minimization (SNM)methods may become very slow or even not applicable for large-scale problems. To addressthis difficulty; we therefore propose an efficient and scalable core tensor Schatten 1-normminimization method for simultaneous tensor decomposition and completion; with a muchlower computational complexity. We first induce the equivalence relation of Schatten 1-normof a low-rank tensor and its core tensor. Then the Schatten 1-norm of the core tensor is usedto replace that of the whole tensor; which leads to a much smaller-scale matrix SNMproblem. Finally; an efficient algorithm with a rank-increasing scheme is developed to solvethe proposed problem with a convergence guarantee.

Field programmable gate array/system on a programmable chip-based implementation of model predictive controller,H Chen; F Xu; Y Xi,To improve the on-line computational performance of model predictive control (MPC) for fastsystems and/or embedded systems; this study proposes a novel scheme for the MPCcontroller implementation based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) and system on aprogrammable chip (SOPC) technology. A Nios II processor clocked at 150 MHz isembedded into the FPGA chip. AC/C++ model of the MPC algorithm which is run in the NiosII processor is created. The dual method is adopted to solve the quadratic programming (QP)problem. Based on FPGA and dSPACE®; a rapid prototyping platform is introduced to testand verify the function and computational performance of the MPC controller.

Early Neolithic diets at Baijia; Wei River valley; China: stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human and faunal remains,Pia Atahan; John Dodson; Xiaoqiang Li; Xinying Zhou; Songmei Hu; Liang Chen; Fiona Bertuch; Kliti Grice,Abstract Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values are presented for faunal and humanbone collagen from Baijia; in the Wei River valley region of Shaanxi Province; China. Theremains have a calibrated age range of ca. 5709–5389 BC; and correspond with the earlyNeolithic Laoguantai Period. Stable isotopic results indicate that human diets included milletand probably aquatic foods such as fish and shellfish. Bovid samples are tentativelyidentified as water buffalo; and have a mean δ 13 C value of− 14.6‰; which reflects somemillet consumption. Whether bovids were grazing on wild millet; or had diets directlyinfluenced by humans; is not known. The single Sus sample from Baijia had a dietdominated by C3 plants and is thus unlikely to have been a domesticated animal.

The released polysaccharide of the cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica inhibits flocculation of the alga with ferric chloride,Li Chen; Pengfu Li; Zhili Liu; Qingcai Jiao,Abstract The effect of the released polysaccharide (RPS) of the cyanobacteriumAphanothece halophytica GR02 on the recovery of the alga by flocculation with ferricchloride was studied. With increasing RPS concentration in algal cultures from 0 to 68 mg L−1 the flocculation efficiency at the same dosage of ferric chloride decreased; and higherdosages of ferric chloride were required to attain the same flocculation efficiency. It isdemonstrated that RPS could form complexes with ferrum during flocculation. In conclusion;RPS of A. halophytica GR02 had a significant inhibitory effect on flocculation of the alga withferric chloride. The inhibitory mechanism of A. halophytica GR02 RPS allows the RPS tocompete for ferrum by forming complexes with ferrum; thus leading to the consumption offerrum in ferric chloride.,Journal of applied phycology,2009,27

In practice;software evolves from one version to another in its life span. The effort of mining frequentsequential patterns across multiple versions of a software can be substantially reduced byefficient incremental mining. This problem is challenging in this domain since the databasesare usually updated in all kinds of manners including insertion; various modifications as wellas removal of sequences. Also; different mining tools may have various mining constraints;such as low minimum support. None of the existing work can be applied effectively due tovarious limitations of such work. For example; our recent work; IncSpan; failed solving theproblem because it could neither handle low minimum support nor removal of sequences …,*,2008,26

Data-driven predictive gearshift control for dual-clutch transmissions and FPGA implementation,Xiaohui Lu; Hong Chen; Bingzhao Gao; Zhenwei Zhang; Weiwei Jin,During the gearshift management process; the shift time and the shift shock affect the shiftquality (smoothness and efficiency) greatly. In this paper; a gearshift controller is designedusing a data-driven predictive control technique to improve the shift quality of vehicles with adual-clutch transmission (DCT). It is directly obtained from the input-output data of a DCTmodel constructed by the commercial software AMESim. In order to obtain an offset-freecontrol for the reference input; a predictor equation is gained with the incremental input andoutputs. The conflicting control requirements of a short shift time and a small shift shock aretaken into account in the optimal objective function by smoothly tracking a selected properreference trajectory and limiting the change rate of the actuator.

Fluorescence imaging is a widely used method; but itsuffers from blinking and photobleaching; and fluorescence tags may block or affect bindingsites on DNA. We report on label-free imaging of single DNA molecules with a differentialplasmonic imaging technique. The technique produces high contrast images due to thescattering of surface plasmonic waves by the molecules and the removal of backgroundnoises and interference patterns; allowing for quantitative analysis of individual DNAmolecules. Simulation of the images based on a scattering model shows good agreementwith the experiment. We further demonstrate optical mapping of single DNA molecules.,ACS nano,2014,25

Top-k nearest keyword search on large graphs,Miao Qiao; Lu Qin; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wentao Tian,Abstract It is quite common for networks emerging nowadays to have labels or textualcontents on the nodes. On such networks; we study the problem of top-k nearest keyword (k-NK) search. In a network G modeled as an undirected graph; each node is attached withzero or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight measuring its length.Given a query node q in G and a keyword λ; a k-NK query seeks k nodes which contain λand are nearest to q. k-NK is not only useful as a stand-alone query but also as a buildingblock for tackling complex graph pattern matching problems. The key to an accurate k-NKresult is a precise shortest distance estimation in a graph. Based on the latest distanceoracle technique; we build a shortest path tree for a distance oracle and use the treedistance as a more accurate estimation. With such representation; the original k-NK query …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,25

Ultrasonically assisted synthesis of 3D hierarchical silver microstructures,Hongjun Chen; Ellen Kern; Christoph Ziegler; Alexander Eychmüller,In this paper; we report on a facile; environmentally friendly; and ultrasonically assisted routeto synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical silver microstructures. This is achievedwithout the use of any templates; surfactants; or polymers. By reducing [Ag (NH3) 2]+ withH2O2 in an aqueous solution; 3D flowerlike silver microstructures (FSMs) are formed withina few minutes. It is found that the duration of sonication and the quantity of H2O2 playimportant roles in the formation of the 3D FSMs. The addition of citrate as a protecting agentchanges the morphology of the products into that of 3D cauliflower-like silver microstructures(CSMs). Due to their large surface areas; these 3D hierarchical silver microstructures mayfind use as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering applications.,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2009,25

The storm clouds clear over China: the memoir of Ch'en Li-fu; 1900-1993,Hsu-hsin Chang; Lifu Chen; Sidney H Ch'en Li-Fu; Ramon Hawley Myers Chang,Introduction marshall pétain once said that" to write one's memoirs is to speak ill ofeverybody except oneself." 1 Does the memoir make for a true; reliable history; or is it a self-serving account to interpret history in a particular way? How do we judge the authenticity ofthe memoir; especially when the author was at the center of great events? By whatstandards can we judge a memoir to be true and credible? These are questions worthpondering when we read the personal account of how Ch'en Li-fu (now ninety-four yearsold) served Chiang Kai-shek for twenty-five years and moved in the highest circles of powerwithin the Chinese Nationalist party (Kuomintang; or KMT) and the government of theRepublic of China (ROC).

The attractive electronic and photophysical properties of pyrenederivatives make the hybrid promising for studying and understanding electron transfermechanisms in organic-functionalized POMs. The hybrid has an electronic absorption at 450nm; indicating that there is a strong electronic interaction between the organic pyreneimidogroup and inorganic hexamolybdate cluster. The electron transfer mechanism of the as-prepared hybrid is illuminated via the combined studies of theoretical calculations andtransient absorption spectroscopy. Time-dependent density functional theory studiesrevealed that the strong electronic absorption at the visible region mainly comes from theoptically allowed π–π* transitions of the pyreneimido component (S0 to S2 transition) …,Dalton Transactions,2012,24
A study on the excitations of ligand-to-metal charge transfer in complexes Cp2MCl2 (Cp= π-C5H5; M= Ti; Zr; Hf) by density functional theory,Xiaojing Wang; Lv Chen; Akira Endou; Momoji Kubo; Akira Miyamoto,Abstract The excitations of ligand-to-metal charge transfer in the UV–vis spectra of thecomplexes Cp 2 MCl 2 (Cp= π-C 5 H 5; M= Ti; Zr; Hf) were described with the time-dependent density functional theory and the differential self-consistent-field densityfunctional theory (ΔSCF–DFT). The nature of the main spectral features was interpreted onthe basis of the electronic structure of the complexes. The optimization of the molecularstructure for Cp 2 MCl 2 yielded consistent pseudotetrahedral geometries. With the transitionfrom ground state to excited state; the electrons transferred from Cp ligands to the centralmetals M; accompanied by an increase in the binding length of M Cl.

The results show that the electroactive white deposit attached to the goldsubstrate is actually composed of zirconium hexacyanoferrate (II). The electrochemicalbehavior of the ZrHCF modified electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry; the peakcurrent is proportional to the sweep rate up to 200 mV s− 1. Under optimized conditions thepeak-to-peak separation is only 3 mV; showing the characteristics of the surface reaction.Ion effects of the supporting electrolyte suggest that cations have a considerable effect onthe electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode.,Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,2001,24
Detection of ferritin in human serum with a MAP–H2O2–HRP voltammetric enzyme-linked immunoassay system,Shusheng Zhang; Kui Jiao; Hongyuan Chen; Manxia Wang,Abstract A voltammetric enzyme-linked immunoassay based on new system of m-aminophenol (MAP)–H 2 O 2–horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has firstly been developed andused for the detection of HRP; labelled HRP and ferritin in human serum. HRP or labelledHRP catalyzes the oxidation reaction of MAP with H 2 O 2; the product of which produces asensitive voltammetric peak at potential of− 0.46 V (vs. SCE) in Britton–Robinson (BR) buffersolution. By using this voltammetric peak; HRP can be measured with a detection limit of9.5× 10− 1 mU/l and a linear range of 2.5–2.5× 10 2 mU/l. The detection limit to ferritin is0.25 ng/ml and the linear range 0.25–320 ng/ml. The processes of the electro-reduction ofthe product of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction have been investigated in detail.,Talanta,1999,24

Robust principal component analysis with missing data,Fanhua Shang; Yuanyuan Liu; James Cheng; Hong Cheng,Abstract Recovering matrices from incomplete and corrupted observations is a fundamentalproblem with many applications in various areas of science and engineering. In theory;under certain conditions; this problem can be solved via a natural convex relaxation.However; all current provable algorithms suffer from superlinear per-iteration cost; whichseverely limits their applicability to large scale problems. In this paper; we propose a robustprincipal component analysis (RPCA) plus matrix completion framework to recover low-rankand sparse matrices from missing and grossly corrupted observations. Under the unifiedframework; we first present a convex robust matrix completion model to replace the linearprojection operator constraint by a simple equality one. To further improve the efficiency ofour convex model; we also develop a scalable structured factorization model; which can …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,23
GBAGC: a general bayesian framework for attributed graph clustering,Zhiqiang Xu; Yiping Ke; Yi Wang; Hong Cheng; James Cheng,Abstract Graph clustering; also known as community detection; is a long-standing problem indata mining. In recent years; with the proliferation of rich attribute information available forobjects in real-world graphs; how to leverage not only structural but also attribute informationfor clustering attributed graphs becomes a new challenge. Most existing works took adistance-based approach. They proposed various distance measures to fuse structural andattribute information and then applied standard techniques for graph clustering based onthese distance measures. In this article; we take an alternative view and propose a novelBayesian framework for attributed graph clustering. Our framework provides a general andprincipled solution to modeling both the structural and the attribute aspects of a graph.

The exact distance to destination in undirected world,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Hong Cheng; Miao Qiao,Abstract Shortest distance queries are essential not only in graph analysis and graph miningtasks but also in database applications; when a large graph needs to be dealt with. Suchshortest distance queries are frequently issued by end-users or requested as a subroutine inreal applications. For intensive queries on large graphs; it is impractical to compute shortestdistances on-line from scratch; and impractical to materialize all-pairs shortest distances. Inthe literature; 2-hop distance labeling is proposed to index the all-pairs shortest distances. Itassigns distance labels to vertices in a large graph in a pre-computing step off-line and thenanswers shortest distance queries on-line by making use of such distance labels; whichavoids exhaustively traversing the large graph when answering queries.

Phylogenetic analysis of the bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 from cattle herds revealing the existence of a genotype A strain in China,Yong-Jun Wen; Xin-Chuan Shi; Feng-Xue Wang; Wei Wang; Shu-Qin Zhang; Guo Li; Ni Song; Li-Zhi Chen; Shi-Peng Cheng; Hua Wu,Abstract In 2009; a bovine parainfluenza virus (BPIV3); named as NM09; was isolated usingMDBK cell culture from the nasal swabs of normal cattle in China. The NM09 isolate wascharacterized by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis. Its complete genome was15;456 nucleotides in length. Similar to other sequenced PIV strains; the NM09 virusconsisted of six non-overlapping genes; which were predicted to encode nine proteins withconserved and complementary 3′ leader and 5′ trailer regions; conserved gene starts;gene stops; and trinucleotide intergenic sequences. Nucleotide phylogenetic analysis ofmatrix and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene demonstrated that this NM09 isolatebelonged to BPIV3 genotype A instead of the previously reported BPIV3 genotype C inChina. It is implicated that the different genotypes A and C might coexist infection for a …,Virus genes,2012,22
Clustering large attributed information networks: an efficient incremental computing approach,Hong Cheng; Yang Zhou; Xin Huang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract In recent years; many information networks have become available for analysis;including social networks; road networks; sensor networks; biological networks; etc. Graphclustering has shown its effectiveness in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goalof graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into clusters based on variouscriteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graphclustering methods mainly focus on the topological structures; but largely ignore the vertexproperties which are often heterogeneous. Recently; a new graph clustering algorithm; SA-cluster; has been proposed which combines structural and attribute similarities through aunified distance measure. SA-Cluster performs matrix multiplication to calculate the randomwalk distances between graph vertices. As part of the clustering refinement; the graph …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,22
Including climate change in pest risk assessment: the peach fruit fly; Bactrocera zonata (Diptera: Tephritidae),WL Ni; Zhi Hong Li; HJ Chen; FH Wan; WW Qu; Z Zhang; DJ Kriticos,Abstract Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) is one of the most harmful species of Tephritidae. Itcauses extensive damage in Asia and threatens many countries located along or near theMediterranean Sea. The climate mapping program; CLIMEX 3.0; and the GIS software;ArcGIS 9.3; were used to model the current and future potential geographical distribution ofB. zonata. The model predicts that; under current climatic conditions; B. zonata will be ableto establish itself throughout much of the tropics and subtropics; including some parts of theUSA; southern China; southeastern Australia and northern New Zealand. Climate changescenarios for the 2070s indicate that the potential distribution of B. zonata will expandpoleward into areas which are currently too cold. The main factors limiting the pest's rangeexpansion are cold; hot and dry stress. The model's predictions of the numbers of …,Bulletin of entomological research,2012,22

A controllable error-drift elimination scheme for watermarking algorithm in H. 264/AVC stream,Weijing Huo; Yuesheng Zhu; Hongyuan Chen,Embedding watermark into H. 264/AVC streams directly can reduce computationalcomplexity compared to encoder-based watermarking algorithms. However; it would causeintra error propagation and decrease the video quality. To improve the video quality andreduce the computational complexity; an improved compensation scheme is developed inthis paper. In this scheme; only some of the integer transform (IT) coefficients are processedas opposed to process all the IT-coefficients as seen in other compensation methods. Thisapproach helps to reduce the computation complexity of this compensation scheme. Thesimulation results have shown that our proposed method has lower computationalcomplexity compared to other algorithms.,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2011,22
Querying shortest path distance with bounded errors in large graphs,Miao Qiao; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Shortest paths and shortest path distances are important primary queries for usersto query in a large graph. In this paper; we propose a new approach to answer shortest pathand shortest path distance queries efficiently with an error bound. The error bound iscontrolled by a user-specified parameter; and the online query efficiency is achieved withprepossessing offline. In the offline preprocessing; we take a reference node embeddingapproach which computes the single-source shortest paths from each reference node to allthe other nodes. To guarantee the user-specified error bound; we design a novel coverage-based reference node selection strategy; and show that selecting the optimal set ofreference nodes is NP-hard. We propose a greedy selection algorithm which exploits thesubmodular property of the formulated objective function; and use a graph partitioning …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,22
The first phylogenetic analysis of Tetrastigma (Miq.) Planch.; the host of Rafflesiaceae,Pingting Chen; Longqing Chen; Jun Wen,Tetrastigma (Vitaceae) comprises about 95 species widely distributed throughoutsubtropical and tropical Asia; and extending to Australia. The genus is best known for beingthe host plants of Rafflesia; with the largest flower in the world; and other members ofRafflesiaceae. The phylogeny ofTetrastigma; however; remains poorly known.

Strong ground motion simulation of the 1999 Chi‐Chi; Taiwan earthquake from a realistic three‐dimensional source and crustal structure,Shiann‐Jong Lee; How‐Wei Chen; Kuo‐Fong Ma,Abstract [1] We simulate the strong ground motion of 1999 Chi-Chi; Taiwan earthquake (Mw= 7.6) by considering a three-dimensional source rupture model in a full waveform three-dimensional wave propagation study. The strong ground motion records during the 1999Chi-Chi earthquake show various characteristics at different sites in Taiwan. We adopt athree-dimensional source model derived from an inversion study with identical path effectsas considered in this three-dimensional forward study. Comparisons between the simulationresults and observed waveforms from dense island-wide strong motion stations demonstratethat the fault geometry; lateral velocity variation; and complex source rupture process greatlyinfluence the distribution of strong ground shaking.

Synthesis and evaluation of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives as potential antitumor agents,Wei-Hua Cheng; Bo Cao; Hai Shang; Cong Niu; Li-Ming Zhang; Zhong-Heng Zhang; Dan-Li Tian; Shi Zhang; Hong Chen; Zhong-Mei Zou,Abstract Cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) is a common cause of treatment failure incancer patients. Increased expression of permeability glycoprotein (P-gp); which is alsoknown as MDR-1; is the main cause of multidrug resistance. Podophyllotoxin derivativeshold great promise in the battle to overcome multidrug resistance; as they can inducecytotoxicity through multiple mechanisms. Here; we synthesized sixteen novelpodophyllotoxin derivatives and evaluated their cytotoxicities in human cancer cell lines;HeLa; K562 and K562/A02. Some of these compounds were more potent than etoposide; aclinically relevant inhibitor of DNA repair enzymes. In particular; compound 5p exhibited themost potent activity toward drug-resistant K562/A02 cells; as it robustly inhibited tumor cellproliferation and induced apoptosis. Furthermore; preliminary investigation suggested …,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2014,21
A Monte Carlo algorithm for cold start recommendation,Yu Rong; Xiao Wen; Hong Cheng,Abstract Recommendation systems have been widely used in E-commerce sites; socialnetworks; etc. One of the core tasks in recommendation systems is to predict the users'ratings on items. Although many models and algorithms have been proposed; how to makeaccurate prediction for new users with extremely few rating records still remains a bigchallenge; which is called the cold start problem. Many existing methods utilize additionalinformation; such as social graphs; to cope with the cold start problem. However; the sideinformation may not always be available. In contrast to such methods; we propose a moregeneral solution to address the cold start problem based on the observed user ratingrecords only. Specifically we define a random walk on a bipartite graph of users and items tosimulate the preference propagation among users; in order to alleviate the data sparsity …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,2014,21

Improved optimal controller for start-up of amt trucks in consideration of driver’s intention,B-Z Gao; H Chen; X-H Lu; K Sanada,Abstract A linear-quadratic optimal controller is proposed for vehicle start-up; which isdesigned as a linear feedback form of the states and the measured (estimated)disturbances. The requirements of less friction loss and less driveline shock are representedby the weighting matrices of the cost function. The driver's intension is also considered andthe controller gains are adjusted on-line accordingly. The designed control strategy is testedon a complete powertrain simulation model. Through large amount of simulations; it isverified that the system is robust to the variations of driving conditions; such as variation ofvehicle mass and road grade. It is also shown that the control performance is influencedgreatly by the estimation error of engine torque and clutch torque; and the acceptable levelof mean estimation error is about±10%.,International Journal of Automotive Technology,2013,21

These eel-like fish use leucine-richrepeat–based receptors for Ag recognition instead of the Ig-based receptors used in jawedvertebrates. We report that in Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica); variable lymphocytereceptor (VLR) B interacts with C1q and C3 proteins to mediate complement-dependentcytotoxicity for bacteria and tumor cells. The immune-based lysis involves deposition ofVLRB and C1q-like protein complex on the surface of target cells; activation of C3; andultimate disruption of cell wall integrity.

However; LVI as a prognostic factor for survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. Methodology/Principal Findings Ameta-analysis of published studies from PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases wasperformed to quantity the effects of LVI on both relapse-free survival and overall survival forpatients with NSCLC. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) wereused to assess the strength of these effects. This meta-analysis included 18;442 NSCLCpatients from 53 eligible studies. LVI appeared in 32.1%(median; range; 2.8% to 70.9%) oftumor samples. In all; patients with LVI were 2.48 times more likely to relapse by univariateanalysis (95% CI: 1.92–3.22) and 1.73 times by multivariate analysis (95% CI: 1.24–2.41) …,PloS one,2012,21
CFD simulation of dynamic characteristics in liquid–solid fluidized beds,Kai Zhang; Guiying Wu; Stefano Brandani; Honggang Chen; Yongping Yang,Abstract A simple two-fluid model is used to predict the hydrodynamics of liquid–solidfluidization after a step change in liquid velocity. Based on the inviscid model A of Gidaspow(1994); the effect of the particles dispersed on the momentum equations is considered in thismodel. Numerical simulations are conducted in the platform of CFX 4.4; a commercial CFDcode; together with user-defined FORTRAN subroutines. Predicted overall bed voidage inthis work is much closer to the experimental measurement than that based on the kinetictheory of granular flow in the literature (Cornelissen et al.; 2007). The results show that thecomputational bed heights in the expansion process fit in with the idealized curve except atthe transitional stage; which leads to actual response time slightly greater than itscorresponding idealized value.

Photocatalytic degradation of pesticide pyridaben. 3. In surfactant/TiO2 aqueous dispersions,Xinle Zhu; Chunwei Yuan; Huilan Chen,The effective TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of pyridaben in an acetronitrile/waterdispersion has been investigated in previous work; but could not be achieved in the case ofreal waters. In this paper; photocatalytic degradation of pyridaben on TiO2 particles underUV light (λ> 360 nm) illumination in surfactant CTAB (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide)aqueous dispersions was studied. 1H NMR was used to determine quantitative informationabout the adsorption mode of pyridaben in CTAB micelles. The results showed that theupfield 1H shifts were largest for long chain protons of CTAB; indicating that the hydrophobicaromatic rings were primarily located in this region. Adsorption models on TiO2 surface werethus proposed. The reaction rates decreased with the increase of pH value; which can beattributed to the surface charge variations of pyridaben adsorbed onto TiO2 particles.

Mining e-learning domain concept map from academic articles,Nian-Shing Chen; Prof Kinshuk; Chun-Wang Wei; Hong-Jhe Chen,Recent research has demonstrated the important of ontology and its applications. Forexample; while designing adaptive learning materials; designers need to refer to theontology of a subject domain. Moreover; ontology can show the whole picture and coreknowledge about a subject domain. Research from literature also suggested that graphicalrepresentation of ontology can reduce the problems of information overload and learningdisorientation for learners. However; ontology constructions used to rely on domain expertsin the past; it is a time consuming and high cost task.

Nonlinear controller for a gantry crane based on partial feedback linearization,Xiaohua Zhang; Bingtuan Gao; Hongjun Chen,This paper presents a nonlinear controller design scheme for a gantry crane system basedon partial feedback linearization. In the underactuated gantry crane system; the activedegrees corresponding to the freedom are linearized based on I/O linearization techniques;while the passive degree is taken as the internal dynamics of the system. The trajectorytracking control of the linearized system is studied by choosing the active degrees as thesystem outputs. The analysis of the system internal dynamics shows that the stability of thezero dynamics guarantees the stability of the control system. Finally; experimental results onthe scale crane show feasibility of the developed controller design scheme.,Control and Automation; 2005. ICCA'05. International Conference on,2005,21
Tectonic controls on the Pleistocene–Holocene Wudalianchi volcanic field (northeastern China),Yu Wang; Hongzhou Chen,Abstract The Wudalianchi volcanic field developed during the Pleistocene–Holocene but isdormant at present. Its latest eruption occurred in 1719–1721 AD. The volcanic rocks arehigh-potassium alkaline basalts derived from the upper mantle (c. 100–120 km depth) asindicated by geochemical data. The field is located in an old tectonic transition zonesurrounded by four regional normal faults. The volcanic craters are aligned along NE–NNE-striking fractures and faults; although a NNW-striking sub-surface fracture zone probablycontrolled the eruptions beginning at 1.33±0.08 Ma. Beneath the volcanic field; the Mohointerface lies at a depth of 33.5–35 km. Eruptions evolved from fissure type to central typeeruptions. The field is characterized by an intraplate tectonic setting in a non-orogeniccompressional regime which resulted from the subduction of the West Pacific plate …,Journal of Asian Earth Sciences,2005,21

An investigation of the preparation of TiO2-based catalysts using methods of thermal analysis,D Qin; W Chang; J Zhou; Y Chen,Abstract Thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction techniques were used to investigate thepreparation of TiO 2-based catalysts. It was found that anatase can transform to rutile; ahighly stable modification; at high temperature (⪢ 1000 K); but with anatase alone thetransformation is slow and not completed at 1273 K. An La promoter has little effect on thetransformation. However; an Li promoter dramatically accelerates the transformation anddecreases the transformation temperature to 853 K. The effect of an Li promoter on thetransformation is possibly due to the substitution of Li+ ions for lattice Ti 4+ ions.

Acquisition of radioresistance in docetaxel-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cells is linked with dysregulation of miR-451/c-Myc-survivin/rad-51 signaling,Rui Wang; Dong-Qin Chen; Jia-Yuan Huang; Kai Zhang; Bing Feng; Ban-Zhou Pan; Jing Chen; Wei De; Long-Bang Chen,Abstract Chemoresistant tumors usually fail to respond to radiotherapy. However; themechanisms involved in chemo-and radiotherapy cross resistance are not fully understood.Previously; we have identified microRNA (miR)-451 as a tumor suppressor in lungadenocarcinoma (LAD). However; whether miR-451 plays critical roles in chemo-andradiotherapy cross resistance in LAD is unclear. Here; we established two docetaxel-resistant LAD cell models (SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX); and showed that miR-451 wassignificantly downregulated in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. Gain-and loss-of-functionassays indicated that re-expression of miR-451 could reverse radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells both in vitro and in vivo through promoting apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).

Top-k structural diversity search in large networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Social contagion depicts a process of information (eg; fads; opinions; news)diffusion in the online social networks. A recent study reports that in a social contagionprocess the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connectedcomponents in an individual's neighborhood. Such a number is termed structural diversity ofan individual and it is shown to be a key predictor in the social contagion process. Based onthis; a fundamental issue in a social network is to find top-k users with the highest structuraldiversities. In this paper; we; for the first time; study the top-k structural diversity searchproblem in a large network. Specifically; we develop an effective upper bound of structuraldiversity for pruning the search space. The upper bound can be incrementally refined in thesearch process. Based on such upper bound; we propose an efficient framework for top-k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,20

Methodology for agricultural and rural NPS pollution in a typical county of the North China Plain,Yong Yang; Ying Chen; Xiaolan Zhang; Edwin Ongley; Lei Zhao,Abstract Agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution has been recently identified by theChinese government as a major source of aquatic pollution. Methodologies commonly usedto make basin-wide or area-wide assessments are problematic and regional distinctionshave not been made relative to rainfall and runoff. Using a typical agricultural county in theHai River basin of the North China Plan we developed methodology to estimate potentialload and delivered load for crops (field crops+ rice); animal production; rural living and fromatmospheric N input. We use scenarios to allow for uncertainty in delivery to estimate therelative roles of different rural forms of pollution. Livestock raising is the major source of NPSpollution. Despite a 75% rural population; rural living contributes almost nothing to surfacewater pollution. While over-fertilization is typical; nutrient runoff from crops is low.

Circular dichroism in double-layer metallic crossed-gratings,Wensheng Gao; Ho Ming Leung; Yunhui Li; Hong Chen; Wing Yim Tam,Abstract We report on the fabrication of double-layer gold crossed-gratings consisting of aconvoluted top gold grating superposed on a bottom gold grating by using an e-beam directwrite technique together with a lift-off process. The crossed-gratings exhibit; in the visiblerange; strong circular dichroism which is dependent upon the incident direction due to theconvoluted top gold grating and also the substrate. Resonance dips in the transmittance ofcircularly polarized light are also observed. The experimental results are explainedqualitatively by simulations using a finite-integration technique. The simulations confirm thatthe dips in the transmittance are electromagnetic resonances corresponding to parallel andanti-parallel current flows in the crossed-gratings.,Journal of optics,2011,20

First; the CIS precursor powdersare synthesized by solvothermal technology. Second; the CIS films are deposited via spin-coating from precursor slurry consisting of CIS particles and selenization process. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD); scanning electron microscopy (SEM); energy dispersive X-rayspectroscopy (EDS) and absorption spectroscopy measurement; the CIS nanoparticleprecursors consisted mainly of plate-like particles showing the chalcopyrite structure withpreferred (1 1 2) orientation. Typical near stoichiometric single phase CIS films with a micron-sized dense grains are prepared after selenization process. An energy band gap about 1.02eV and an absorption coefficient exceeding 10 5 cm− 1 are also obtained in our work.,Physica B: Condensed Matter,2010,20

As compared to the undoped TiO 2; the synthesized N-doped TiO 2 had visible-light photoresponse and exhibited a significant increase in thephotocurrent under Xe-light irradiation. Then high-porous NiO was deposited onto the N-doped TiO 2 layer by chemical bath deposition (CBD) to obtain TiO 2− x N x/NiO bilayer thinfilms. The TiO 2− x N x/NiO electrode showed excellent photoelectrochromic properties andenergy storage capability. Upon light irradiation; the formed holes gave rise to the oxidationof NiO to NiOOH; and the color of the TiO 2− x N x/NiO electrode changed from colorless tobrown. After 2 h irradiation; the discharge time was about 4.2 h at the current density of …,Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells,2010,20
Synthesis of different gold nanostructures by solar radiation and their SERS spectroscopy,Hongjun Chen; Yuling Wang; Shaojun Dong,Abstract In this article; a simple and novel photochemical synthesis of different goldnanostructures is proposed using solar radiation. This method is rapid; convenient and oflow cost; and can be performed under ambient conditions. By adjusting the concentration ofsodium acetate (NaAc); different morphologies of the products can be easily obtained.Without NaAc; the products obtained are mainly polyhedral gold particles; lowerconcentration of NaAc (0.05 and 0.1 M) accelerates the formation of flowerlike goldnanostructures; while higher concentration of NaAc (0.5 M) facilitates the formation of avariety of gold nanowires and nanobelts. It is found that the morphology change of goldnanaostructures is the result of the synergistic effect of poly (diallyl dimethylammonium)chloride (PDDA); Ac− ions; and the pH value. In addition; the different gold nanostructures …,Journal of Raman Spectroscopy,2009,20

Dense community detection in multi-valued attributed networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The proliferation of rich information available for real world entities and theirrelationships gives rise to a general type of graph; namely multi-valued attributed graph;where graph vertices are associated with a number of attributes and a vertex may havemultiple values on an attribute. It would be useful if we can cluster such graphs into denselyconnected components with homogeneous attribute values. Recent work has studied graphclustering in attributed graphs considering the full attribute space. However; full spaceclustering often leads to poor results due to irrelevant attributes. In this paper; we studysubspace clustering in multi-valued attributed graph and propose an algorithm SCMAG forcommunity detection.

Adrenergic signaling promotes angiogenesis through endothelial cell–tumor cell crosstalk,Hongyu Chen; Dan Liu; Zhengyan Yang; Limin Sun; Que Deng; Shuo Yang; Lu Qian; Liang Guo; Ming Yu; Meiru Hu; Ming Shi; Ning Guo,Abstract Angiogenesis is an important factor in invasive tumor growth; progression; andmetastasis. Multiple proangiogenic mechanisms are involved in tumor angiogenesis. In thisstudy; we showed that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine upregulated VEGF (VEGFA)expression in breast cancer cells and that the culture supernatant from norepinephrine-treated breast cancer cells promoted the formation of the capillary-like network of endothelialcells. However; the effects of norepinephrine were further enhanced when the endothelialcells were cocultured with breast cancer cells; indicating a critical role of tumor cell–endothelial cell contacts in norepinephrine-induced tumor angiogenesis. Interestingly;norepinephrine dramatically induced the activation of the Notch pathway; which is a cell-contact-mediated intercellular signaling pathway and tightly linked to tumor cell–stromal …,Endocrine-related cancer,2014,19

An investigation on InxGa1− xN/GaN multiple quantum well solar cells,Qingwen Deng; Xiaoliang Wang; Hongling Xiao; Cuimei Wang; Haibo Yin; Hong Chen; Qifeng Hou; Defeng Lin; Jinmin Li; Zhanguo Wang; Xun Hou,Abstract The conversion efficiency of In x Ga 1− x N/GaN multiple quantum well solar cells isoriginally investigated in theory based on the ideal diode model and the ideal unity quantumwell model. The results reveal that the conversion efficiency partially depends on the widthof the quantum well and the thickness of the barrier region but is dominated by the numberof quantum wells and indium content of In x Ga 1− x N. The calculated results are found tobe basically trustworthy by comparing with reported experimental results. An In 0.15 Ga 0.85N/GaN multiple quantum well solar cell is successfully fabricated with a conversionefficiency of 0.2%. The main discrepancy between calculated and experimental results is thematerial quality and manufacturing technology which need to be improved.,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2011,19

Homotopy continuation method for calculating critical loci of binary mixtures,Ming Chung Wang; David Shan Hill Wong; Hongyuan Chen; Wei Yan; Tian-Min Guo,Abstract This work describes an algorithm that uses the Heidemann and Khalil (1980; AI Ch.EJ; 26; 769–779) critical point criteria and a homotopy continuation technique for calculatingcritical loci in binary mixtures. This approach is able to track smoothly transition from G/Lcritical points to L/L critical points without the need of changing initial estimates. Suchtransitions marked by the existence of a turning point in the critical locus are commonlyfound in type III and IV mixtures. The tangent plane global stability tests are included tolocate UCEPs and LCEPs which are intersections of the critical locus and the LLG line. Thecontinuation method is as efficient as a gradient-based approach like Heidemann andKhalil's method and as robust as the Hicks and Young's grid-search approach.

The couplingconstants between 183W and 31P are about 110 and 300 Hz for the trans and cis isomers;respectively; which is consistent with the differences in WP bond distances. The cis andtrans isomers come to equilibrium in solution; with detectable amounts of both present. The[trans] l [cis] equilibrium constant at 50" C for the PMezPh system is 0.40 f 0.05. The rates ofthe isomerization for the PMezPh system is greatly slowed down by free phosphine insolution; but they are basically unchanged when free phosphine concentrations increasefrom 0.0021 to 0.415 M. Competing mechanisms; one involving phosphine dissociation asthe rate determining step and the other a unimolecular one are proposed. It is suggested …,Inorganic Chemistry,1994,19

Pressure-induced polymerization of nitrogen in potassium azides,Jianfu Li; Xiaoli Wang; Ning Xu; Daoyong Li; Dongchao Wang; Li Chen,Abstract The phase transition and structural evolution of KN 3 are systematically studiedusing first-principles density functional (DFT) methods and the particle swarm optimization(PSO) structure search algorithm under pressures up to 400 GPa. For the first time; weidentify three stable phases with $ C2/m $; $ P6/\textit {mmm} $ and $ C2/m {\_}\text {II} $structure at pressures of 15.7; 41.4 and 298.6 GPa. The analysis of the crystal structures ofthree new predicted phases reveals that the transition of N 3− ions goes from linearmolecules to benzene-like rings and then to polymer chains induced by pressure. The studyof atomic and electronic structures of three predicted phases reveals that the structuralchanges are accompanied and driven by the change of atomic orbital hybridization; first fromsp to sp 2; and then from sp 2 to sp 3. Our result provides a new view of the pressure …,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2013,18

Two models in which the new heavy particle is a color singlet or acolor triplet are considered; decaying; respectively; to tq or tq; leading to a resonance withinthe t t+ jets signature. The full 2011 ATLAS pp collision data set from the LHC (4.7 fb− 1) isused to search for tt events produced in association with jets; in which one of the W bosonsfrom the top quarks decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically. The data areconsistent with the Standard Model expectation; and a new particle with mass below 430Gev for both W′ boson and color triplet models is excluded at 95% confidence level;assuming unit right-handed coupling.,Physical Review D,2012,18

This imbalance of polymer formation leadsto consistent bending action along the etched NWs; coiling the resulting Ag-PThnanocomposites into planar spirals. We studied the etching intermediates and also theeffects of the surface ligands in order to understand the symmetry-breaking action. Thedefect-dependent etching chemistry offers a new means to induce motion and a novelperspective in the ordered occurrence of certain defects.

Metabolic basis of sexual dimorphism in PKU mice after genome-targeted PAH gene therapy,Li Chen; Swan N Thung; Savio LC Woo,We have previously reported a transgene delivery system based on phiBT1 bacteriophageintegrase that results in targeted insertion of transgenes into mammalian genomes; and itsuse in the delivery of murine phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) complementary DNA (cDNA)into the hepatocytes of male phenylketonuria (PKU) mice; leading to a complete andpermanent correction of their hyperphenylalaninemic phenotype. In this study; we reportonly partial phenotypic correction in female PKU mice; even though hepatic PAH activities inboth sexes after gene treatment were similar. Daily injections of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4);an essential co-factor for phenylalanine hydroxylation; in the gene-treated females led tocomplete correction of their PKU phenotype. After gonadectomy; serum phenylalanine levelsin the gene-treated females were reduced to normal; whereas those in the gene-treated …,Molecular Therapy,2007,17
Investigations of the light-induced scattering varied with Hf O 2 codoping in Li Nb O 3: Fe crystals,Wenbo Yan; Hongjian Chen; Lihong Shi; Shiguo Liu; Yongfa Kong,Light-induced scattering in Li Nb O 3: Fe crystals codoped with different concentrations of HfO 2 has been investigated. Unusual behaviors with varied Hf O 2 codoping are observedand explained. Li vacancies are suggested to be the main contributor to the darkconductivity of the crystal and subsequently to induce the threshold effect of the pump lightintensity for the light-induced scattering. High photovoltaic field produced in the crystals isthought to be the cause of the serious light-induced scattering at high pump intensity. As aresult; Li Nb O 3: Fe; Hf crystals exhibit an enhanced ability to suppress the light-inducedscattering at moderate pump intensity.,Applied physics letters,2007,17
Photochemical formation of silver and gold nanostructures at the air–water interface and their electrocatalytic properties,Hongjun Chen; Jianbo Jia; Shaojun Dong,Abstract In this paper; we report a simple method of fabricating silver and goldnanostructures at the air–water interface; which can be spontaneously assembled throughthe reduction of AgNO 3 and HAuCl 4 with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in the presence ofpolyacrylic acid (PAA); respectively. It was found that the building blocks in the silvernanostructure are mainly interwoven silver nanofilaments; while those of the goldnanostructure are mainly different sizes of gold nanoparticles and some truncated goldnanoplates; and even coalescence into networks. At the air–water interface; these silver andgold nanostructures can be easily transferred onto the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO)slides and used for electrochemical measurements. After a replacement reaction with H 2PdCl 4; the silver nanostructure is transformed into a Ag–Pd bimetallic nanostructure; with …,Nanotechnology,2007,17
Optimization of the trienzyme extraction for the microbiological assay of folate in vegetables,Liwen Chen; Ronald R Eitenmiller,Response surface methodology was applied to optimize the trienzyme digestion for theextraction of folate from vegetables. Trienzyme extraction is a combined enzymatic digestionby protease; α-amylase; and conjugase (γ-glutamyl hydrolase) to liberate the carbohydrateand protein-bound folates from food matrices for total folate analysis. It is the extractionmethod used in AOAC Official Method 2004.05 for assay of total folate in cereal grainproducts. Certified reference material (CRM) 485 mixed vegetables was used to representthe matrix of vegetables. Regression and ridge analysis were performed by statisticalanalysis software. The predicted second-order polynomial model was adequate (R 2=0.947); without significant lack of fit (p> 0.1). Both protease and α-amylase have significanteffects on the extraction. Ridge analysis gave an optimum trienzyme digestion time …,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2007,17

Role of TRPV1 channels in ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury,Lan Chen; Lajos Markó; Mario Kaßmann; Ye Zhu; Kaiyin Wu; Maik Gollasch,Objectives Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-positive sensory nerves arewidely distributed in the kidney; suggesting that TRPV1-mediated action may participate inthe regulation of renal function under pathophysiological conditions. Stimulation of TRPV1channels protects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI).However; it is unknown whether inhibition of these channels is detrimental in AKI or not. Wetested the role of TRPV1 channels in I/R-induced AKI by modulating these channels withcapsaicin (TRPV1 agonist); capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist) and using Trpv1−/− mice.Methods and Results Anesthetized C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 25 min of renalischemia and 24 hrs of reperfusion.

Measuring the impact of MVC attack in large complex networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Zechao Shang,Abstract Measuring the impact of network attack is an important issue in network science. Inthis paper; we study the impact of maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack in large complexnetworks; where the attacker aims at deleting as many edges of the network as possible byattacking a small fraction of nodes. First; we present two metrics to measure the impact ofMVC attack. To compute these metrics; we propose an efficient randomized greedyalgorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee. Second; we generalize the MVC attackinto an uncertain setting; in which a node is deleted by the attacker with a prior probability.We refer to the MVC attack under such uncertain environment as the probabilistic MVCattack. Based on the probabilistic MVC attack; we propose two adaptive metrics; and thenpresent an adaptive greedy algorithm for calculating such metrics accurately and …,Information Sciences,2014,16
The major cholesterol metabolite cholestane-3β; 5α; 6β-triol functions as an endogenous neuroprotectant,Haiyan Hu; Yuehan Zhou; Tiandong Leng; Ailing Liu; Youqiong Wang; Xiuhua You; Jingkao Chen; Lipeng Tang; Wenli Chen; Pengxin Qiu; Wei Yin; Yijun Huang; Jingxia Zhang; Liwei Wang; Hanfei Sang; Guangmei Yan,Overstimulation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors is believed to be responsible forneuronal death of the CNS in various disorders; including cerebral and spinal cordischemia. However; the intrinsic and physiological mechanisms of modulation of thesereceptors are essentially unknown. Here we report that cholestane-3β; 5α; 6β-triol (triol); amajor metabolite of cholesterol; is an endogenous neuroprotectant and protects againstneuronal injury both in vitro and in vivo via negative modulation of NMDA receptors.Treatment of cultured neurons with triol protects against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity;and administration of triol significantly decreases neuronal injury after spinal cord ischemiain rabbits and transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats.

Identification of Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Coastal Waters in Sanya Bay; South China Sea by Chemometrics.,J Ling; ML Wu; YF Chen; YY Zhang; JD Dong,Abstract Anthropogenic influence and natural processes exert important effects on theaquatic ecosystem of Sanya Bay in the northern part of the South China Sea. These effectsresult to the temporal and spatial differences of water quality in the bay. In this study; four-way principal component analysis is employed to identify the natural characteristics of thewater in this bay; as well as the anthropogenic effects on its water quality. The resultsindicate that anthropogenic influence (nutrients as indicator) is the dominant factor thataffects the water quality at the mouth of Sanya River (S1). This region exhibits the maximumeffects of the discharge from Saya River; which is indicated by higher nutrient levels and Chla than in outer bay. Both upwelling and mixing caused by monsoons are the dominantfactors that affect water quality in the central and outer bays. The water exchange …,Journal of Environmental Informatics,2014,16
Monthly variation of some parameters about internal solitary waves in the South China sea,Shuqun Cai; Jieshuo Xie; Jiexin Xu; Dongxiao Wang; Zhiwu Chen; Xiaodong Deng; Xiaomin Long,Abstract In this paper; by non-dimensional analysis; it is found that finite-depth theory ismore appropriate to the study of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in the South China Sea (SCS)than shallow-water theory. The 1-degree grid data of monthly mean temperature and salinitydata at standard levels in the SCS are used to solve the linearized vertical eigenvalueproblem. The nonlinear parameter and the wave phase speed are computed; then thenonlinear phase speed and the characteristic half-width of ISWs are calculated respectivelyby two different theories to investigate the difference between these two parameters in theSCS. The nonlinearity is the strongest near the continental slope of the SCS or islandswhere the bottom topography changes sharply; it is stronger in summer than that in winter; itincreases (decreases) as pycnocline depth deepens (shallows); stratification strengthens …,Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers,2014,16
A car pooling model and solution method with stochastic vehicle travel times,Shangyao Yan; Chun-Ying Chen; Sheng-Chieh Chang,Carpooling is one method that can be easily instituted and can help resolve a variety ofproblems that continue to plague urban areas; ranging from energy demands and trafficcongestion to environmental pollution. However; most carpooling organizations currentlyuse a trial-and-error process; in accordance with the projected vehicle travel times; forcarpooling; which is neither effective nor efficient. In other words; stochastic disturbancesarising from variations in vehicle travel times in actual operations are neglected. In the worstcase scenario; where vehicle travel times fluctuate wildly during operations; the plannedschedule could be disturbed enough to lose its optimality. Therefore; we constructed astochastic carpooling model that considers the influence of stochastic travel times. Themodel is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem.

The influence of SVC on voltage stability of power system based on bifurcation theory [J],Xiu YANG; Hong-he JIN; Chen-ji GUO; Yu CHEN; Hong-yu CHEN,The bifurcation study of power system voltage stability has an important role inunderstanding the voltage unstable process deeply. Especially for flexible AC system(FACTS); such as static Var compensator (SVC); the bifurcation study can analyze theimpact of dynamic control performance on voltage stability. In this paper; the bifurcationanalysis software AUTO2000 is used for the comparative study for power system with andwithout SVC; and the bifurcation point and bifurcation behavior on the point is studied. Thenwith double parameters bifurcation analysis; the bifurcation boundary is obtained. Thestudied results show that with SVC; the SNB and Hopf bifurcation (HB) point can be delayed;which mean that SVC can add load limit to improve voltage stability.

Spontaneous Formation of Two-Dimensional Gold Networks at the Air− Water Interface and Their Application in Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS),Hongjun Chen; Yuling Wang; Heqing Jiang; Baifeng Liu; Shaojun Dong,Two-dimensional (2-D) gold networks were spontaneously formed at the air− water interfaceafter HAuCl4 reacted with fructose at 90° C in a sealed vessel; in a reaction in which fructoseacted as both a reducing and a protecting agent. Through fine-tuning of the molar ratio ofHAuCl4 to fructose; the thus-formed 2-D gold networks can be changed from a coalescedpattern to an interconnected pattern. In the coalesced pattern; some well-defined single-crystalline gold plates at the micrometer-scale could be seen; while in the interconnectedpattern; many sub-micrometer particles and some irregular gold plates instead of well-defined gold plates appeared. It is also found that the 2-D gold networks in the form of aninterconnected pattern can be used as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering(SERS) because of the strong localized electromagnetic field produced by the gaps …,Crystal Growth & Design,2007,16
Mutation analysis of ARVCF gene on chromosome 22q11 as a candidate for a schizophrenia gene,Hsiang-Yin Chen; Jih-I Yeh; Chen-Jee Hong; Chia-Hsiang Chen,Schizophrenia is a devastating chronic mental illness affecting approximately 1% of thegeneral population worldwide. Previously; researchers have demonstrated a high degree ofheritance in its etiology; but the complex nature of schizophrenia such as clinicalheterogeneity; incomplete penetrance; uncertain mode of inheritance and geneticheterogeneity has made the mapping of the gene for this illness challenging.Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is characterized by clinical phenotypes such asconotruncal heart defects; cleft palate and/or lip; and dysmorphic facial features; and isassociated with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 22q11. Patients with VCFS have ahigher prevalence of schizophrenic disorder than that seen in the general population(Shprintzen et al.; 1992; Murphy et al.; 1999); which indicates that the deleted region of …,Schizophrenia research,2005,16

Mechanism of the interaction between bromophenol blue and bovine serum albumin,WG Cao; QC Jiao; Y Fu; L Chen; Q Liu,The mechanism of the interaction between Bromophenol Blue (BPB) and Bovine SerumAlbumin (BSA) was studied spectrophotometrically. Absorption spectral changes of BPB–BSA and BPB–Chitosan mixtures in different BSA and Chitosan concentrations arediscussed. The influence of different experimental conditions on the absorption spectra ofBPB–BSA mixtures was investigated. Through these experiments; the conclusion was drawnthat the bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra of the BPB–BSA reaction system resultsmainly from hydrophobic interaction between BPB and BSA; while electrostatic force isnecessary for the formation of the BPB–BSA complex.,Spectroscopy letters,2003,16

Repairing vertex labels under neighborhood constraints,Shaoxu Song; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lei Chen,Abstract A broad class of data; ranging from similarity networks; workflow networks to proteinnetworks; can be modeled as graphs with data values as vertex labels. The vertex labels(data values) are often dirty for various reasons such as typos or erroneous reporting ofresults in scientific experiments. Neighborhood constraints; specifying label pairs that areallowed to appear on adjacent vertexes in the graph; are employed to detect and repairerroneous vertex labels. In this paper; we study the problem of repairing vertex labels tomake graphs satisfy neighborhood constraints. Unfortunately; the relabeling problem isproved to be NP hard; which motivates us to devise approximation methods for repairing;and identify interesting special cases (star and clique constraints) that can be efficientlysolved. We propose several approximate repairing algorithms including greedy heuristics …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,15

Factor matrix trace norm minimization for low-rank tensor completion,Yuanyuan Liu; Fanhua Shang; Hong Cheng; James Cheng; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Most existing low-n-rank minimization algorithms for tensor completion suffer fromhigh computational cost due to involving multiple singular value decompositions (SVDs) ateach iteration. To address this issue; we propose a novel factor matrix trace normminimization method for tensor completion problems. Based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition; we first formulate a factor matrix rank minimization model bydeducing the relation between the rank of each factor matrix and the mode-n rank of atensor.

Random-walk domination in large graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,We introduce and formulate two types of random-walk domination problems in graphsmotivated by a number of applications in practice (eg; item-placement problem in onlinesocial networks; Ads-placement problem in advertisement networks; and resource-placement problem in P2P networks). Specifically; given a graph G; the goal of the first typeof random-walk domination problem is to target k nodes such that the total hitting time of anL-length random walk starting from the remaining nodes to the targeted nodes is minimized.The second type of random-walk domination problem is to find k nodes to maximize theexpected number of nodes that hit any one targeted node through an L-length random walk.We prove that these problems are two special instances of the submodular set functionmaximization with cardinality constraint problem. To solve them effectively; we propose a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,15

Redox-mediated dissolution of paramagnetic nanolids to achieve a smart theranostic system,Aifei Wang; Mingyi Guo; Nan Wang; Jianyun Zhao; Wenxiu Qi; Faheem Muhammad; Liang Chen; Yingjie Guo; Nam-Trung Nguyen; Guangshan Zhu,Manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising T1 contrastagent. In this study; for the first time; we demonstrated an interaction of Mn3O4 with abiological system; and found redox sensitive behavior of these paramagnetic nanoparticlesin intracellular reducing environment. Inspired by these findings; we for the first time usedthis interaction for some therapeutic advantages and designed a versatile mesoporous silicabased nanotheranostic system to realize redox-activated enhanced magnetic resonanceimaging and responsive anticancer drug delivery. Contrary to previous reports; we firstlyprepared high quality amine terminated hydrophilic Mn3O4 nanolids; without using multistepligand exchange strategies.

3rd tone sandhi in standard Chinese: A corpus approach,JH Yuan; YY Chen,Abstract In Standard Chinese; a low tone (Tone3) is often realized with a rising F0 contourbefore another low tone; this tone change is known as the 3rd tone sandhi. This studyinvestigated the acoustic characteristics of the 3rd tone sandhi in Standard Chinese intelephone conversations and broadcast news speech. The sandhi rising tone was found tobe different from the lexical rising tone (Tone2) in disyllabic words in two measures: themagnitude of the F0 rise and the time span of the F0 rise. We also found that word frequencyaffected the realization of the sandhi rising tone. Specifically; the sandhi rising tone in highlyfrequent words exhibited a smaller F0 rise (ie; a greater difference from the lexical risingtone) than that observed in less frequent words. This result suggests that different processesmay be involved in producing high-vs. low-frequency words in Chinese.,Journal of Chinese Linguistics,2014,15
The level of hepatic ABCC6 expression determines the severity of calcification after cardiac injury,Christopher Brampton; Zouhair Aherrahrou; Li-Hsieh Chen; Ludovic Martin; Arthur AB Bergen; Theo GMF Gorgels; Jeannette Erdfdi; Heribert Schunkert; Zalán Szabó; András Váradi; Olivier Le Saux,Because vascular or cardiac mineralization is inversely correlated with morbidity and long-term survival; we investigated the role of ABCC6 in the calcification response to cardiacinjury in mice. By using two models of infarction; nonischemic cryoinjury and thepathologically relevant coronary artery ligation; we confirmed a large propensity to acutecardiac mineralization in Abcc6−/− mice. Furthermore; when the expression of ABCC6 wasreduced to approximately 38% of wild-type levels in Abcc6+/− mice; no calcium deposits ininjured cardiac tissue were observed. In addition; we used a gene therapy approach todeliver a functional human ABCC6 via hydrodynamic tail vein injection to approximately13% of mouse hepatocytes; significantly reducing the calcification response to cardiaccryoinjury. We observed that the level and distribution of known regulators of …,The American journal of pathology,2014,15

Intracellularfree Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) elevation induced by infection can cause cell death; but[Ca2+] i changes and high [Ca2+] i-induced death of macrophages due to infection ofLeptospira have not been previously reported. Methodology/Principal Findings We first useda Ca2+-specific fluorescence probe to confirm that the infection of L. interrogans strain Laitriggered a significant increase of [Ca2+] i in mouse J774A. 1 or human THP-1macrophages. Laser confocal microscopic examination showed that the [Ca2+] i elevationwas caused by both extracellular Ca2+ influx through the purinergic receptor; P2X7; andCa2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum; as seen by suppression of [Ca2+] i …,PLoS One,2013,15
Non-linear modelling and control of semi-active suspensions with variable damping,Huang Chen; Chen Long; Chao-Chun Yuan; Hao-Bin Jiang,Electro-hydraulic dampers can provide variable damping force that is modulated by varyingthe command current; furthermore; they offer advantages such as lower power; rapidresponse; lower cost; and simple hardware. However; accurate characterisation of non-linear f–v properties in pre-yield and force saturation in post-yield is still required.Meanwhile; traditional linear or quarter vehicle models contain various non-linearities. Thedevelopment of a multi-body dynamics model is very complex; and therefore; SIMPACK wasused with suitable improvements for model development and numerical simulations.

An exploration of pattern-based subtopic modeling for search result diversification,Wei Zheng; Xuanhui Wang; Hui Fang; Hong Cheng,Abstract Traditional information retrieval models do not necessarily provide users withoptimal search experience because the top ranked documents may contain the same pieceof relevant information; ie; the same subtopic of a query. The goal of search resultdiversification is to return search results that not only are relevant to the query but also coverdifferent subtopics. Therefore; the subtopic modeling is an important research topic in searchresult diversification. In this paper; we propose a novel pattern based method to extractsubtopics from retrieved documents. The basic idea is to explicitly model a query subtopic asa semantically meaningful text unit in relevant documents. We apply a frequent patternmining algorithm to efficiently extract these text units (patterns) from retrieved documents.We then model a query subtopic with a single pattern and rank subtopics based on their …,Proceedings of the 11th annual international ACM/IEEE joint conference on Digital libraries,2011,15
Low-complexity multiple-component turbo-decoding-aided hybrid ARQ,Hong Chen; Robert G Maunder; Lajos Hanzo,Previous research has focused on improving the throughput of hybrid automatic repeatrequest (HARQ) schemes. However; since turbo codes have been introduced into HARQschemes; their complexity has increased owing to the iterative Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv(BCJR) operations that are required following each retransmission. This paper explores thecomplexity of turbo HARQ schemes and proposes a new early stopping (ES) approach foriterative decoding based on mutual information (MI); which dynamically determines theappropriate number of BCJR operations to be performed following each incrementalredundancy (IR) transmission. We demonstrate that the proposed ES-based multiple-component turbo code (MCTC)-aided and systematic twin-component turbo code (TCTC)-assisted HARQ schemes exhibit 60%-85% reduced complexity for signal-to-noise ratios …,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2011,15

Fountain-code aided file transfer in 802.11 WLANs,Hong Chen; R Maunder; Lajos Hanzo,Fountain codes constitute novel erasure codes; which have been standardized for ForwardError Correction (FEC) in broadcast network protocols and by the Third-GenerationPartnersonhip Project (3 GPP). The basic operational units of Fountain codes are sourcepackets; which have a particular fixed length. These codes are invoked here in an 802.11Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) scenario for protecting file transfers. More specifically;the optimal packet length is selected by considering the 802.11 Media Access Control(MAC) retransmission rate and the properties of the physical layer's modulation scheme.Naturally; owing to the limited memory of the encoders/decoders; large source files must bedecomposed into shorter transport blocks.

Improvement of spectral resolution by using the excitation dependence of dipole–dipole interaction in a dense atomic gas,H Li; TS Varzhapetyan; VA Sautenkov; Yu V Rostovtsev; H Chen; D Sarkisyan; MO Scully,Abstract We have studied the selective reflection from the interface between a denserubidium (Rb) atomic vapor and a transparent dielectric. A remarkable narrowing of thespectrum; which can be used to improve the resolution of spectroscopy of dense media; hasbeen demonstrated. This narrowing results from the reduction of the dipole–dipoleinteraction between atoms when the Rb vapor is excited by a strong pump laser. By usingthis technique; we have resolved the hyperfine structure of the Rb D 2 line; which is hiddenby collisional broadening.,Applied Physics B,2008,15

Since EUVis not ready; double patterning combined with Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET)such as shrink techniques seems to be the most possible solution. Companies such asTSMC [1] and IBM [2] etc. are pushing out EUV to extend immersion ArF lithography to32nm/22nm nodes. Last year; we presented our development work on 32nm node contact(50nm hole at 100nm pitch) using dry ArF lithography by double patterning with SAFIERshrink process [3]. To continue the work; we further extend our dry litho capability towardsthe 22nm node. We demonstrated double patterning capability of 40nm holes at 80nm pitchusing ASML XT1400E scanner.

Electrochemical properties of ferrocene adsorbed on multi-walled carbon nanotubes electrode,Dahao Zheng; Hong Li; Baoyi Lu; Zhenghe Xu; Hongyu Chen,Abstract The adsorbed process of ferrocene on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified bymulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and electrochemical properties of the adsorbedlayers are investigated. It is found that the redox process of ferrocene in solution is controlledby diffusion and surface electrochemical steps on the MWNT/GC electrode in contrast to thediffusion-controlled process of ferrocene on the GC electrode. The adsorbed ferroceneexhibits a pair of well-defined redox waves in the potential range from− 0.2 V to 0.6 V.Interestingly; two pairs of obvious redox waves for the adsorbed ferrocene are observed atthe switching potential over 0.8 V and the peak current values of redox waves in morepositive potential increase with the enlarging switching potential. The electrochemicalreaction model of ferrocene adsorbed on the MWNT/GC electrode is proposed.,Thin Solid Films,2008,15

An image quality assessment algorithm based on dual-scale edge structure similarity,Bin Liao; Yan Chen,The quality assessment of images is meaningful for most video and images applications.Recently a new metric called structure similarity index (SSIM) is proposed for assessingimage quality with better reflection to human visual characteristics than traditional PSNRmetrics. However; SSIM exhibits some defects in evaluating the quality of blurred imagesand Gaussian noise images. This paper proposes a new image quality assessmentalgorithm based on dual-scale edge structure similarity (MDESSIM) to the issue above. Withdifferent from SSIM; the algorithm sufficiently considers image edge information within thestructure information; and includes the distortion metric of edge structure in the image qualityassessment. Experiments demonstrate that MDESSIM maintains better consistency withhuman subjective perception for wider kinds of images.,Innovative Computing; Information and Control; 2007. ICICIC'07.

Dynamic Modeling of a Gantry Crane System [J],Bing-tuan GAO; Hong-jun CHEN; Xiao-hua ZHANG,Based on Lagrange equations; a dynamic model is derived for typical underactuatedmechanical gantry crane system. The dynamic model considers the simultaneous traveling;traversing; and hoisting motions of the crane; and the resulting payload swing; and theswing angle of the payload in space is described by specially defined two-degree-of-freedom angle. Thanks to the characteristics of the proposed swing angle description; thedynamic model for the three-dimensional crane can be easily reduced to that of a two-dimensional crane by deleting one degree. For the controller design; the linearized dynamicmodel is also presented with the linearization conditions. Finally; simulation resultsdemonstrate the effectiveness of the prompted dynamic model.,Computer Simulation,2006,15

According to the development of laumontitization and its relationship tomineralization; authors reveal that the laumontitization appeared mainly at the top andperiphery to ore\| bodies. It befallen at the edge of the geothermal fluid system or happenedin the late stage of geothermal fluid system evolution; hence can be assigned as an indicatorto prospect for epithermal gold deposit. The fluid causing laumontitization in the Axi golddeposit is similar to those causing hot spring type gold deposit or in modern geothermalfield.

Voltammetric determination of mifepristone at a DNA-modified carbon paste electrode,Kai Gu; Junjie Zhu; Yanling Zhu; Jinzhong Xu; H-Y Chen,Abstract A new strategy for the preparation of a DNA-modified carbon paste electrode isdeveloped. It is found that the anodic response of mifepristone is greatly enhanced at thedsDNA-modified carbon paste electrode comparing with that obtained at the bare electrode;while the response at a ssDNA-modified electrode is similar to bare electrode. So thedsDNA-modified electrode is employed as a sensitive biosensor for the detection ofmifepristone. A linear dependence of the peak currents on the concentration is observed inthe range 2.0× 10–7∼ 2.0× 10–6 mol/L; with a detection limit of 1.0× 10–7 mol/L. Therelative standard deviation is 4.3% for six successive determinations of 1.0× 10–6 mol/Lmifepristone.

A quasi-infinite horizon nonlinear predictive control scheme for stable systems: Application to a CSTR,H Chen; F Allgöwer,Abstract We introduce in this paper a nonlinear model predictive control scheme for stablesystems with input constraints. Closed-loop stability is guaranteed by an appropriate choiceof the finite prediction horizon; independent of the specification of the desired controlperformance. In addition; this control scheme is likely to allow “real time” implementation;because of its computational attractiveness. The theoretical results will be demonstrated anddiscussed with a CSTR control application.,IFAC Proceedings Volumes,1997,15
Laser-Induced Transient Electric Birefringence and Light Scattering in an Aerosol-OT/CCl4 Reverse Micelle,HM Chen; ZA Schelly,Simultaneous transient turbidity and electric birefringence (optical Kerr effect) are induced inAerosol-OT/CC14 reverse micelles by single; 300 ps long; linearly polarized step pulses of aNd: YAG laser. No effect is observed with 50 ns &-switched pulses. A method of extractingthe birefringence component from the turbidity-dominated signal is described. Thebirefringence is a consequence of the creation of induced micellar dipoles in the direction ofthe optical electric field; E; and the turbidity is the result of clustering of micelles. Thereequilibration process following the laser E-jump consists of two relaxations; both in the lo2;us range. The faster relaxation is attributed to the collapse of anisotropic structures and theslower one to the disintegration of the clusters. The effects of surfactant concentration; watercontent; and temperature on the relaxation rate and amplitude of cluster decay are …,Langmuir,1995,15

Concomitantly; P. aeruginosa uses the periplasm-localized immunity protein Tsi3 to prevent potential self-intoxication caused by Tse3; andthus gains an edge over rival bacteria in fierce niche competition. Here; we report the crystalstructures of Tse3 and the Tse3–Tsi3 complex. Tse3 contains an annexin repeat-like fold atthe N-terminus and a G-type lysozyme fold at the C-terminus. One loop in the N-terminaldomain (Loop 12) and one helix (α9) from the C-terminal domain together anchor Tse3 andthe Tse3–Tsi3 complex to membrane in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro; and thismembrane-binding ability is essential for Tse3's activity. In the C-terminal domain; a Y …,Molecular microbiology,2014,14

However;little is known about the function of four annotated Crp/Fnr homologs (DVU0379; DVU2097;DVU2547; and DVU3111) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. A systematic study usingbioinformatic; transcriptomic; genetic; and physiological approaches was conducted tocharacterize their roles in stress responses. Similar growth phenotypes were observed forthe crp/fnr deletion mutants under multiple stress conditions. Nevertheless; the idea ofdistinct functions of Crp/Fnr-type regulators in stress responses was supported byphylogeny; gene transcription changes; fitness changes; and physiological differences.

In allfour materials; we observed clear surface states centered at the Γ point of the surfaceBrillouin zone. We further studied the evolution of these surface states under controlledsurface contamination of CO and O 2 gas molecules; and found that the surface states in Bi2 Te 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 were both robust against the direct influence of these gas molecules;while the surface states of Bi and Sb could be easily destroyed under the same condition.Our finding provides direct experimental evidence confirming the unusual robustness of thetopological surface state of topological insulators with the presence of the time reversalsymmetry.,Physica E: Low-dimensional Systems and Nanostructures,2012,14
Investigations on the UV photorefractivity of LiNbO 3: Hf,Wenbo Yan; Lihong Shi; Hongjian Chen; Xinzheng Zhang; Yongfa Kong,The UV photorefractivity of LiNbO_3: Hf was investigated by beam distortion and two-wavecoupling experiments. A sharp decrease of beam distortion was found between Hfconcentrations of 2 and 2.5 mol.%; indicating a significant increase of photoconductivitythere. The energy-transfer direction of the two-wave coupling and the effect of chemicalreduction on the UV photorefractivity reveal that electrons are the carriers responsible for theUV photorefraction. Moreover; dissimilar with LiNbO_3 highly doped with Mg; Zn; and In; thegrating recorded in LiNbO_3: Hf was found to be nearly stable in the dark but sensitive to redlight; which can be attributed to the special location of Fe ions in the crystal lattice.,Optics letters,2010,14

Function and regulation of controllable shunt reactor.,Weixian Chen; He Chen,With the rapid development of EHV systems and construction of UHV lines in China;controllable shunt reactors are expected to be put into operation in the near future as one ofthe important electro-apparatus. They have the ability to compensate for the dynamiccapacitive power of transmission lines smoothly; suppress the power frequency overvoltageeffectively; and avoid the overvoltage in the case of empty line interruption. They are also beable to prevent the power frequency resonance and impel the secondary arc to suppressionwhen a small power inductance is connected to the neutral of reactors. These functions havebeen partly presented in the open literature.

Structure and identity of 4; 4 ‘-thiobisbenzenethiol self-assembled monolayers,Yuling Wang; Linfeng Gan; Hongjun Chen; Shaojun Dong; Jin Wang,Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 4; 4 '-thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT) can be formed onAu surface spontaneously. The structural characteristics and adsorption behavior of TBBTSAMs on Au have been investigated by surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS);electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV); ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS); and atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM). It is demonstrated that TBBT adsorbed on Au by losing a H atom; formingone Au− S bond; and the other mercapto group is free at the surface of the monolayer owingto the presence of the νS-H at 2513 cm-1 and the δC-SH at 910 cm-1 in SERS. Theenhancement of the vibration of C− S (1064 cm-1); the aromatic C− H vibration (3044 cm-1);and the absence of the vibration of S− S illustrate TBBT adsorbed on Au forming amonolayer with one benzene ring tilted with respect to the Au surface.

Myelin-associated glycoprotein-mediated signaling in central nervous system pathophysiology,Yanan Chen; Selina Aulia; Bor Luen Tang,Abstract The myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a type I membrane-spanning proteinexpressed exclusively in oligoden drocytes and Schwann cells. It has two generally knownpathophysiological roles in the central nervous system (CNS): maintenance of myelinintegrity and inhibition of CNS axonal regeneration. The subtle CNS phenotype resultingfrom genetic ablation of MAG expression has made mechanistic analysis of its functionalrole in these difficult. However; the past few years have brought some major revelations;particularly in terms of mechanisms of MAG signaling through the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR)complex. Although apparently converging through NgR; a readily noticeable fact is that theneuronal growth inhibitory effect of MAG differs from that of Nogo-66. This may result fromthe influence of coreceptors in the form of gangliosides or from MAG-specific neuronal …,Molecular neurobiology,2006,14

Associations of MYH3 gene copy number variations with transcriptional expression and growth traits in Chinese cattle,Yao Xu; Tao Shi; Hanfang Cai; Yang Zhou; Xianyong Lan; Chunlei Zhang; Chuzhao Lei; Xinglei Qi; Hong Chen,Abstract Copy number variations (CNVs) have been recently recognized as anotherimportant genetic variability complementary to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Compelling evidence has indicated that CNVs are responsible for phenotypic traits bychanging the copy numbers of functional genes. Myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3) gene is acritical regulatory factor in skeletal muscle development; and has been detected in the CNVsregion by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array. This study was conducted tovalidate and detect the distribution of MYH3 copy numbers (relative to Angus cattle) in fourChinese cattle breeds (NY; QC; LX; and CY); and further to investigate the associations ofthe copy number changes with its transcriptional expression and cattle growth traits.Substantial genetic differences of MYH3 copy numbers were identified between NY and …,Gene,2014,13
Estimating hydroxyl radical photochemical formation rates in natural waters during long-term laboratory irradiation experiments,Luni Sun; Hongmei Chen; Hussain A Abdulla; Kenneth Mopper,In this study it was observed that; during long-term irradiations (> 1 day) of natural waters;the methods for measuring hydroxyl radical (˙ OH) formation rates based upon sequentiallydetermined cumulative concentrations of photoproducts from probes significantlyunderestimate actual˙ OH formation rates. Performing a correction using thephotodegradation rates of the probe products improves the˙ OH estimation for short termirradiations (< 1 day); but not long term irradiations. Only the 'instantaneous' formation rates;which were obtained by adding probes to aliquots at each time point and irradiating thesesub-samples for a short time (≤ 2 h); were found appropriate for accurately estimating˙ OHphotochemical formation rates during long-term laboratory irradiation experiments. Ourresults also showed that in iron-and dissolved organic matter (DOM)-rich water samples;˙ …,Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts,2014,13

Purification of metallurgical-grade silicon via acid leaching; calcination and quenching before boron complexation,Yan-Hui Sun; Qi-Hui Ye; Chang-Juan Guo; Hong-Yu Chen; Xu Lang; Finlow David; Qi-Wen Luo; Chun-Mei Yang,Abstract The effects of hydrofluoric acid concentration ([HF]); silicon particle size; calcinationand quenching (C&Q); in addition to complexation with various ligands on the purification ofmetallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si); which was achieved via leaching with mixed nitric acid(HNO 3) and HF acid; were investigated by observing the removal efficiency of boron andthe rest of the impurities; and the purified silicon recovery. The investigation suggested thathigher [HF] and smaller silicon particle sizes were beneficial for the removal of boron and allother impurities within a certain range but were not advantageous for recovering the purifiedsilicon. The selected MG-Si particles were within 44–74 micron (μm) and the leaching acidwas composed of 2.0 M HNO 3+ 2.0 M HF. This investigation also revealed that moreimpurities and cracks were exposed on the surface of MG-Si after C&Q; which aided the …,Hydrometallurgy,2013,13
Deficiency of Erbin induces resistance of cervical cancer cells to anoikis in a STAT3-dependent manner,Y Hu; H Chen; C Duan; D Liu; L Qian; Z Yang; L Guo; L Song; M Yu; M Hu; M Shi; N Guo,Abstract Epithelial cell polarization and integration are essential to their function and loss ofepithelial polarity and tissue architecture correlates with the development of aggressivetumors. Erbin is a basolateral membrane-associated protein. The roles of Erbin inestablishing cell polarization and regulating cell adhesion have been suggested. Erbin isalso a negative regulator in Ras-Raf-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signalingpathway. However; the potential functions of Erbin in human cancer are basically unknown.In the present study; we show; for the first time; that loss of Erbin endows cervical cancercells with resistance to anoikis both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the growth andmetastasis of human cervical cancer xenografts in nude mice. We found that knockdown ofErbin induced the phosphorylation; nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities of …,Oncogenesis,2013,13

Proteomic features of potential tumor suppressor NESG1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Zhen Liu; Chao Chen; Huiling Yang; Yajie Zhang; Jie Long; Xiaobin Long; Weiyi Fang,Abstract We previously defined the recently revised NESG1 gene as a potential tumorsuppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here; we further used proteomicstechnology to globally examine NESG1-controlled proteins in NPC cells. Twenty-six proteinswere found to be deregulated by NESG1 using proteomics analysis while enolase 1(alpha)(ENO1); heat shock protein 90 kDa beta (Grp94); member 1 (HSP90B1); andcathepsin D (CTSD) proteins were differentially expressed by Western blot. Interestingly; a-enolase (ENO1); an overexpressed gene in NPC; was confirmed as a NESG1-regulatedprotein in NPC cells. Overexpressed ENO1 not only restored cell proliferation and cell-cycleprogression; but also antagonized the regulation of NESG1 to cell-cycle regulators p21 andCCNA1 expression as well as induced the expression of C-Myc; pRB; and E2F1 in …,Proteomics,2012,13

Trace norm regularized CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition with missing data,Yuanyuan Liu; Fanhua Shang; Licheng Jiao; James Cheng; Hong Cheng,In recent years; low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) problems have received a significantamount of attention in computer vision; data mining; and signal processing. The existingtrace norm minimization algorithms for iteratively solving LRTC problems involve multiplesingular value decompositions of very large matrices at each iteration. Therefore; they sufferfrom high computational cost. In this paper; we propose a novel trace norm regularizedCANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (TNCP) method for simultaneous tensordecomposition and completion. We first formulate a factor matrix rank minimization model bydeducing the relation between the rank of each factor matrix and the mode-n rank of atensor. Then; we introduce a tractable relaxation of our rank function; and then achieve aconvex combination problem of much smaller-scale matrix trace norm minimization …,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2015,12
An improved method to study CO 2–oil relative permeability under miscible conditions,FF Li; SL Yang; H Chen; X Zhang; DD Yin; LP He; Z Wang,Abstract Relative permeability curves are crucial parameters for reservoir engineer andreservoir commercial simulator to predict reservoir performance throughout the life of areservoir; but meet difficulties in laboratory to obtain reliable data under miscible conditionsdue to the lack of proper testing and formulation methods. Up to now; most relativepermeability curves are measured in short core segments by core flooding; which can hardlydisplay miscible flooding features for early gas breakthrough and insufficient contacting timebetween CO 2 and oil. In addition; the commonly used analytical and semi-analytical dataprocessing methods are not suitable for miscible flooding for ignoring the mechanism ofvaporizing and dissolving mechanism.

Plasmon-enhanced ultraviolet photoluminescence from the hybrid plasmonic Fabry–Perot microcavity of Ag/ZnO microwires,Ming-Ming Jiang; Bin Zhao; Hong-Yu Chen; Dong-Xu Zhao; Chong-Xin Shan; De-Zhen Shen,We propose a kind of hybrid plasmonic Fabry–Perot (F–P) microcavity consisting of ZnOmicrowires with quadrate cross-section and planar multilayer metal–insulator–metal (MIM)homostructures with a nanoscale SiO2 gap in between. MIM homostructures can be used tocreate a micro-resonator that simultaneously provides feedback for laser action andsupports the coupling between the plasmonic waveguide modes and microwire modesacross the gap. The hybridization of ZnO microwire modes and surface plasmons across thegap forms hybrid plasmonic F–P microcavity modes; which are highly confined to the low-loss SiO2 gap region. By comparing with bare ZnO microwires; an enhancement inphotoluminescence (PL) intensity of two orders of magnitude is realized experimentally dueto the coupling between plasmonic MIM homostructures and ZnO microwires.

Circular dichroism in single-layered gold sawtooth gratings,Wensheng Gao; Ching Yan Ng; Ho Ming Leung; Yunhui Li; Hong Chen; Wing Yim Tam,We report on the fabrication of single-layered gold sawtooth gratings consisting of И; V; andN basic units by using an e-beam direct write technique together with a lift-off process. The И-and N-type sawtooth gratings are 2D chiral but not the V-type sawtooth grating. Largecircular dichroism (CD) in the visible range is observed for the chiral sawtooth gratings whilethere is none for the V-type sawtooth grating. The experimental results are modelledqualitatively by simulations using a finite integration technique. The simulations show thatthe CD observed is due to the difference in the absorption in the metal for circularlypolarized incidence light of different handedness. The sawtooth gratings are simple and canbe easily mass produced for possible applications in waveplates and circular polarizers.,JOSA B,2012,12
Host immune gene polymorphisms were associated with the prognosis of non‐small‐cell lung cancer in Chinese,Juncheng Dai; Zhibin Hu; Jing Dong; Lin Xu; Shiyang Pan; Yue Jiang; Guangfu Jin; Yijiang Chen; Hongbing Shen,Abstract Laboratory-based studies showed that host immune genes could influence theprognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore; genetic polymorphisms in hostimmune genes may serve as predictors for NSCLC clinical outcome. To test the hypothesisthat functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in host immune genes areassociated with the prognosis of NSCLC; we systematically performed a genotypinganalysis for a total of 178 SNPs from 52 immune genes in a prospective case cohort of 568NSCLC patients. Among the 178 SNPs; 24 were significantly associated with NSCLCprognosis in different genetic models and four of them were remained in the final predictivemodel after multivariate stepwise Cox regression; including IL-5R rs11713419 (5′-untranslated region; 5′-UTR)(P= 0.001); IL23R rs6682925 (5′-flanking region; 5′-FR) …,International journal of cancer,2012,12
Near-Thermal Reactions of Au+ (1S; 3D) with CH3X (X= F; Cl),William S Taylor; Cullen C Matthews; Ashley J Hicks; Kendall G Fancher; Li Chen Chen,Reactions of Au+ (1S) and Au+ (3D) with CH3F and CH3Cl have been carried out in a driftcell in He at a pressure of 3.5 Torr at both room temperature and reduced temperatures inorder to explore the influence of the electronic state of the metal on reaction outcomes. State-specific product channels and overall two-body rate constants were identified usingelectronic state chromatography. These results indicate that Au+ (1S) reacts to yield anassociation product in addition to AuCH2+ in parallel steps with both neutrals. Productdistributions for association vs HX elimination were determined to be 79% association/21%HX elimination for X= F and 50% association/50% HX elimination when X= Cl. Reaction ofAu+ (3D) with CH3F also results in HF elimination; which in this case is thought to produce3AuCH2+.

Approximate homogeneous graph summarization,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,抄録 Graph patterns are able to represent the complex structural relations among objects inmany applications in various domains. The objective of graph summarization is to obtain aconcise representation of a single large graph; which is interpretable and suitable foranalysis. A good summary can reveal the hidden relationships between nodes in a graph.The key issue is how to construct a high-quality and representative super-graph; GS; inwhich a super-node summarizes a collection of nodes based on the similarity of attributevalues and neighborhood relationships associated with nodes in G; and a super-edgesummarizes the edges between nodes in G that are represented by two different super-nodes in G S.

Space charge characteristics of the interface in oil-paper insulation under DC voltage,YX Zhou; Meng Huang; WJ Chen; QH Sun; YS Wang; Ling Zhang,We investigated space charge distribution in a two-layer oil-paper insulation system usingthe pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique; and analyzed the effects of electric field andinterface on space charge characteristics. The test results show that both interface andelectric field affect the behavior of space charge. The interface between two oil-paper layersacts as a barrier to negative charge; as a result; negative charge accumulates adjacent tothe interface. The space charge accumulation and dissipation in two-layer samples is slowwhether it is in the process of polarization or depolarization. Under a higher electric field; theenhancement of the process of space charge injection at the anode covers the process ofionization near the anode. We believe that the potential barrier at the interface between two-layer dielectrics is the root cause of the slow motion of the space charge inside.

Cytosensor Constructed with a Biomimetic Fibronectin-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes on Glassy Carbon Heated Electrode,Xue Zhong; Guang-Sheng Qian; Jing-Juan Xu; Hong-Yuan Chen,In this paper; an interface constructed with fibronectin (Fn) functionalized multiple-walledcarbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was prepared which can efficiently capture cells. The acid-treated MWNTs were covalently coupled with Fn in the presence of a coupling agent; thusrealizing the efficient immobilization of Fn; and it was proven by infrared spectroscopy. Dueto the specific binding of integrin receptor on cells and the arginine-glycine-aspartic acidamino acids (RGD) peptide contained in Fn; this interface not only has a property forcapturing SMMC 7721 cells; but also efficiently retains viability of immobilized cells. Thepresence of MWNTs not only increases the surface area of the electrode but also promotesthe electrochemical behavior of SMMC 7721 cells.

Self-learning control of space flexible manipulator base on gauss function fuzzy neural network,ZB Hong; Li Chen,The self-learning control of a free-floating space flexible manipulator based on fuzzy neuralnetwork is studied. The dynamic equations of the system can be developed by using theLagrangian assumed modal methods. Because the momentum conservation is strictlydeveloped; the dynamics of the space flexible manipulator is nonlinear strongly. When thefuzzy control and neural network are combined; namely the fuzzy inference is realized byneural network; the fuzzy control can self-learn. Based on the results; the self-learningcontroller of the space flexible manipulator in a joint space is designed. The controller doesnot require the measuring position; the velocity as well as the acceleration of the base. Andthe numerical simulation is carried out; which confirms the controller proposed is feasibleand effective.,Engineering mechanics,2008,12

Power system voltage control by multiple STATCOMs based on learning humoral immune response,HF Wang; H Li; H Chen,An approach for power system voltage control is proposed based on the learning humoralimmune response which can not only fulfil the conventional task of a voltage controller in apower system to keep the voltage at the controller's busbar to a setting reference value at thenormal operation mode; but also minimise or eliminate voltage violations at its adjacentbusbars in power system contingencies. This dual voltage control function is the majoradvantage of the approach proposed and is achieved by the capability of the humoralimmune voltage control to identify self and nonself antigen intrusion (voltage variations andviolations) to the power system. It is proposed that the parameters of a humoral immunevoltage controller are trained by learning algorithms via offline simulation.

It was found that the implanted ironatoms diffused out of the film and aggregated with the formation of particle islands on the filmsurface gradually after annealing. The out diffusion and island formation phenomena areparticularly evident when the annealing temperature was elevated up to 800° C. It was alsodemonstrated that in the early stage of annealing the growth of iron islands closelydepended on the out diffusion of the implanted iron atoms; and both the size and areal …,Journal of applied physics,1999,12
Investigation of Voltammetric Enzyme‐Linked Immunoassay Based on a New System of OAP‐H2O2‐HRP,Shusheng Zhang; Kui Jiao; Hongyuan Chen,Abstract A voltammetric enzyme-linked immunoassay based on a new system of o-aminophenol (OAP)-H 2 O 2-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been developed and usedfor detection of HRP; labelled HRP and southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV). HRP orlabelled HRP catalyzes the oxidation reaction of OAP with H 2 O 2; the product of whichproduces a sensitive voltammetric peak at a potential of–0.43 V (vs. SCE) in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer solution. By using this voltammetric peak; HRP can be measured witha detection limit of 6.0× 10–13 g/mL and a linear range of 1.0× 10–12–4.0× 10–9 g/mL.

A new queueing model for aircraft landing process,Hong Chen; Yiyuan Zhao; Hong Chen; Yiyuan Zhao,Abstract This paper presents a new queueing model; C/D/1; for aircraft landing process.Previous analysis of aircraft landing process using queueing theory has assumed Poissoninput model; which describes interaircraft arrival times as independent. In reality; air trafficcontrollers constantly regulate aircraft to maintain safe separations. As a result; inter-aircraftarrival times are dependent. The queueing model proposed in this paper predicts landingtimes of a series of aircraft by evenly spaced time intervals contaminated by uncertainfluctuations. It is shown using this model that all aircraft delays are bounded for boundeduncertainties when the aircraft arrival rate is less than or equal to runway capacity (ie runwayutilization rate is less than or equal to one). This is in contrast to the Poisson model; whichpredicts infinite aircraft delays as runway utilization rate approaches one. Numerical …,*,1997,12

Electrocatalytic reduction of artemether by hemin,Yang Chen; Chun‐Xiang He; Shi‐Min Zhu; Hong‐Yuan Chen; Ying Li,Abstract Artemether is an important widely used derivative of artemisinin. On a glassycarbon electrode; artemether under‐goes an entirely irreversible reduction at ca.− 1.18 V.Hemin can catalyze the reduction of artemether as it catalyzes that of artemisinin. In thepresence of concentrations of hemin as low as 8× 10− 8 M; the reduction happens at− 0.54V; reducing the cathodic overpotential ca. 640 mV. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)‐Fe (III) complex also catalyzes the reduction of artemether while reducing the cathodicoverpotential about 680 mV; but a concentration of at least Formula M was required.Experiments suggested artemether might undergo the identical antimalarial mechanism asartemisinin. All these further confirm the important role of hemin in the mechanism of actionof artemisinin‐type drugs.,Journal of The Electrochemical Society,1997,12
A MODIFIEDH2FEEDFORWARD ACTIVE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR SUPPRESSING BROADBAND RANDOM AND TRANSIENT NOISES,M Bai; H Chen,Abstract Three feedforward active noise control algorithms based onH 2; H∞; andmodifiedH 2 optimal model matching principles are investigated in this study. The first twomethods provide significant attenuation for broadband random noises. However; theH 2andH∞ methods generally result in high-gain controllers at high frequencies; which calls forsome truncation measures in the frequency domain. The third method effectively eliminatesthe high-gain problem of the ordinaryH 2 andH∞ algorithms. In addition; this method isguaranteed to result in a causal and stable controller which is crucial in practicalimplementation. The algorithms are coded into controllers by using a floating-point digitalsignal processor. The experimental results show significant attenuation for stationarybroadband random noises as well as transient impact noises in a duct.,Journal of sound and vibration,1996,12

Coupling of flame geometry and combustion instabilities based on kilohertz formaldehyde PLIF measurements,Patton M Allison; Yuntao Chen; Matthias Ihme; James F Driscoll,Abstract In the past; flame geometry was found to play an important role in determining whenstrong pressure fluctuations associated with a combustion instability occur in a gas turbinemodel combustor. The goals of this study were to use flame surface area as a more accurateway to quantify the flame shape and the heat release rate; in lieu of chemiluminescence; toaccurately resolve both the spatial structure and the time history of the heat releasefluctuations; and to show that kilohertz formaldehyde planar laser-induced fluorescenceprovides a new way to achieve these goals. The dual-swirl burner; developed at DLRStuttgart by Meier et al. was operated using dimethyl ether (DME) to study fluctuations in theflame surface area; flame brush; flame length; and heat release rate. To understand theinstability; accurate measurements are needed of the correlation between heat release …,Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,2015,11
System-theoretic analysis of a class of battery equalization systems: Mathematical modeling and performance evaluation,Haoqi Chen; Liang Zhang; Yehui Han,Battery equalizers are widely used in multi-battery systems to maintain balanced chargeamong individual battery cells. While the research on the hardware realization of batteryequalizers has received significant attention; rigorous analysis of the battery equalizationprocess at the system level remains largely unexplored. In this paper; we study three typesof battery equalization system structures: series-based; layer-based; and module-based.Specifically; we derive mathematical models that describe the system-level behavior of thebattery equalization processes under these equalization structures. Then; based on themathematical models; analytical methods are developed to evaluate the performance of theequalization processes. In addition; we carry out statistical analysis to compare theperformance of the three equalization structures considered.,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2015,11

Density stratification influences on generation of different modes internal solitary waves,Zhi‐Wu Chen; Jieshuo Xie; Dongxiao Wang; Jie‐Min Zhan; Jiexin Xu; Shuqun Cai,An ideal tide-topography interaction model is utilized for studying the influence of density stratification(pycnocline depth d ; thickness δ ; and the density difference Δ ρ a across the pycnocline) onnonlinear disintegration of the first (mode-1) and second (mode-2) baroclinic mode internal tidesinto internal solitary waves (ISWs). The solution methods include weakly nonlinear analysis andfully nonlinear simulation. It is found that as d increases; even though the energy flux intomode-1 internal tides is always larger than that into mode-2 ones at generation; mode-2 ISWsemerge and mode-1 ISWs are suppressed. As δ increases; the total energy conversion and thefluxes into both mode-1 and mode-2 tides all increase first and then decrease. Duringpropagation; a thick pycnocline is actually not favorable for the emergence of mode-2 ISWs; andthe simulated well-developed mode-2 ISWs for a pycnocline of intermediate thickness …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans,2014,11

Moreover; themost appropriate composition of PUFA to play the protective role is unclear. The aim of thismeta-analysis was to ascertain the protective role of PUFA on POAF and the mostappropriate composition. Methods Studies were identified through PubMed; CENTRAL;EMBASE; reviews and reference lists of relevant papers. The odds ratio (OR) was calculatedfor POAF. Statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.0. Results Elevenrandomised controlled trials with 3137 patients were included in the analysis. The use ofPUFA alone did not reduce the incidence of POAF compared with the control (OR: 0.76; 95%confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-1.03; P= 0.08; I 2= 52%).

Considering easy-implementation; the controller is rearranged into a concisestructure which contains a feedforward control and a feedback control. Then; robustness ofthe closed-loop error system is discussed in the framework of the input to state stability (ISS)theory; where model uncertainties are considered as the additive disturbance inputs.Furthermore; due to the application of the backstepping method; the closed-loop errorsystem is ordered as a linear system. Using the linear system theory; a guideline forselecting the controller parameters is deduced which could reduce the workload ofparameters tuning.

Onset of oscillatory double-diffusive buoyancy instability in an inclined rectangular cavity,Zhi-Wu Chen; Yok-Sheung Li; Jie-Min Zhan,Abstract Double-diffusive buoyancy convection in an inclined rectangular closed cavity withimposed temperatures and concentrations along two opposite sidewalls is considered.Attention is restricted to the case where the opposing thermal and solutal buoyancy effectsare of equal magnitude (buoyancy ratio R ρ=− 1). In this case a quiescent equilibriumsolution exists and can remain stable up to a critical thermal Grashof number Gr c. For bothinfinite and finite layers; linear stability analysis shows that; when the cavity inclination α withrespect to gravity decreases from 0° to− 90°; Gr c for the onset of stationary instabilityincreases exponentially while that for the onset of oscillatory instability decreasesexponentially. Below a critical α c; the first onset of instability is oscillatory; rather thanstationary.

Auto-disturbance rejection control for three-phase voltage-type PWM rectifier,Yuanbo Guo; Xin Zhou; Xiaohua Zhang; Hongjun Chen,Traditional voltage-outer-loop controllers have weak disturbance rejection ability; therefore;auto-disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for three-phase voltage-type pulse-width-modulation (PWM) rectifier is proposed. Based on the PWM rectifier model in thesynchronous reference frame; a current-inner-loop controller is designed with the feedbacklinearization control method. The traditional ADRC is improved with the new nonlinear stateerror feedback function. Moreover; its convergence speed is faster than the speed of thelinear state error feedback function; and the chattering of the traditional ADRC is eliminated.The voltage-outer-loop controller and its parameters tuning methods are given based on theimproved ADRC. Experimental results show that; the proposed PWM rectifier control systemhas better steady and dynamic performances; and especially has a good rejection ability …,Dianli Xitong Zidonghua(Automation of Electric Power Systems),2011,11
Selective Detection of p‐Phenylenediamine in Hair Dyes Based on a Special CE Mechanism Using MnO2 Nanowires,Yu‐Hui Bai; Jin‐Yi Li; Yu‐hua Zhu; Jing‐Juan Xu; Hong‐Yuan Chen,Abstract We report a novel approach for selective determination of p-phenylenediamine inhair dyes using β-MnO 2 nanowires modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes through anelectrochemical co-deposition process with chitosan hydrogel. A special CE (chemicalreaction and electron transfer) process on the surface of β-MnO 2 nanowires modified GCelectrode is proposed and proved by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy in thepresence of p-phenylenediamine. p-Phenylenediamine can react with MnO 2 nanowires toproduce diimine and the equilibrium of the two-electron and two-proton redox process of p-phenylenediamine on the electrode is changed; and consequently the reductive current isenhanced significantly.

Preparation; characterization; and properties of ferric molybdate nanotubes for propene epoxidation by air,Wang Li; Ma Tao; Wei SHENG; GUO Xuefeng; DING Weiping; CHEN Yi,Abstract Ferric molybdate nanotubes of various compositions were prepared based on theKirkendall effect and the solid state reaction of MoO 3/FeO x core/shell nanorods at 693 K.These were characterized by transmission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction; infraredspectroscopy; and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The lower synthesis temperature usedfor these ferric molybdate nanotubes led to enriched Mo species on the nanotube surfaceand a special interaction between the Mo and Fe species within the nanotubes. Fairly highselectivity for propene oxide in the epoxidation of propene was achieved and ascribed to theunique synthetic method and nanotubular structure.,Chinese Journal of Catalysis,2009,11

Novel configurable architecture of ML-decomposed binary arithmetic encoder for multimedia applications,Yu-Jen Chen; Chen-Han Tsai; Liang-Gee Chen,A novel architecture of ML-decomposed binary arithmetic coder is proposed. Through theanalysis of previous designs; the traditional processing unit is divided into two parts; MPSencoder and LPS encoder. With different arrangements of these two basic components; wedevelop two types of ML-decomposed structures. To increase the throughput of arithmeticcoding; ML cascade architecture puts the coders in serial; while throughput-selectionarchitecture offers several choices in parallel. Their design methodologies are described inthis paper. Both methods achieve very high throughput; more than 800 M symbols/sec. Andthey are configurable and extensible to supply a wide range of specifications. Moreover; theproposed architecture can be used in binary arithmetic coding of various video and imagestandards.,VLSI Design; Automation and Test; 2007. VLSI-DAT 2007.

Heterogeneous catalytic reaction at a methylene blue/Nafion® modified carbon fiber microcylinder electrode,Huangxian Ju; Yigang Xun; Hongyuan Chen,Microelectrodes have attracted great interest for analytical applications [1] and the study ofhomogeneous reaction kinetics [2]. Recently; the study of heterogeneous catalytic reactionsat microelectrodes modified with many kinds of mediators or promoters has been reportedbecause of the need to determine the nature of biomolecules in special small environments[3-6]. However; because of the high mass transport rate of microelectrodes [1; 7]; the productof the electrode reaction diffuses rapidly from the electrode surface and the catalyticefficiency declines greatly [8]. Therefore it is generally not easy to study the catalyticreactions at a microelectrode unless exceptionally high scan rates are employed or acoating polymer is used to fix the mediators or promoters efficiently. Hemoglobin (HB) is animportant respiratory protein in red cells. The determination of HB is very significant in …,Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,1995,11
Investigation of microelectrodes: IX: Study of the edge effects at a microdisk electrode,Huangxian Ju; Hongyuan Chen; Hong Gao,The behaviour of microdisk electrodes has attracted much notice; owing to their strong edgeeffect [1; 2]. The diffusion regions at these electrodes have been studied theoretically [2-91.In order to describe the mass transport rate at a microdisk electrode; some authors [1; 8; 9]have compared the current density and the mass transport rate at the microdisk electrodewith those at a rotating disk electrode; but the results were quite different; even for electrodesof identical radius; However; these data have often been cited in various situations tocharacterize the mass transfer efficiency of the microdisk electrode; producing a confusion ofdata. Thus; it is necessary to study further the basic problem and to establish a reasonablekinetic model. Our work describes the relations of the current density and the mass transportrate between these two types of electrode.

Output consensus for multiple non-holonomic systems under directed communication topology,Yaojin Xu; Yu-Ping Tian; YangQuan Chen,In this paper; the problem of output consensus for multiple non-holonomic systems inchained form has been investigated. First; an output consensus controller under the stronglyconnected communication topology is devised by two steps; where a time-varying controlstrategy and the backstepping design technique are employed. Then; the results areextended to the general directed topology case via graph decomposition; in which the input-to-state stability theory plays a critical role. We prove that the proposed controller canachieve the semi-global output consensus among multiple non-holonomic systems;provided that the interaction graph contains a spanning tree. Finally; numerical examplesare provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed controller.,International Journal of Systems Science,2015,10

It is found that; whenISWs pass; the mixing rate increases largely. The variation of the time-averaged verticalcurrent shear agrees well with the KdV equation theory; indicating a minimum shear nearthe background main thermocline. In the upper layer; when the ISWs arrive; the maximumturbulent dissipation rate and the diapycnal mixing rate can increase by three orders ofmagnitude; after the passage of ISWs; the mixing reduces sharply to a normal magnitude asthat before the arrival of the ISWs.

Magnetic particles and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles tagging for signal-amplifying detection of nucleic acids,XiaoYa Dong; WeiWei Zhao; JingJuan Xu; HongYuan Chen,Abstract A versatile DNA recognition system using cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdSNPs) as labels was proposed for ultrasensitive detection of specific sequence DNA basedon target recycling. This strategy utilized the magnetic particles (MNPs) for theimmobilization of linker DNA and CdS NPs and the subsequent target DNA hybridization.Using the unique characteristic of nicking endonuclease for cutting one specific strand ofdouble strand DNA (ds DNA); the linker DNA could be transected and the target DNA couldbe liberated for re-hybridization and hence the amount of released CdS NPs was enhanced.Due to the advantage of the MNPs and signal amplification from the target recycling; theanalyte DNA could be detected by the square-wave stripping voltammetry (SWV) in a widelinear range from 0.4 fM to 100 fM with the detection limit down to 0.08 fM.

The most stable isomerof the neutral AsSi 2 cluster has an isosceles triangle structure (2n− 1). Edge-capping with asilicon atom to 2n− 1; yields the lowest energy structure of the neutral AsSi 3 cluster; adeformed planar rhombus structure (3n− 1). The ground state structure of the neutral AsSi 4cluster is predicted to have a trigonal bipyramid form (4n− 1). Adding one; two; or three Siatoms to different positions in this 4n− 1 structure gives the lowest energy structures of theneutral AsSi 5; AsSi 6; and AsSi 7 clusters (5n− 1; 6n− 1; and 7n− 1); respectively.

Low EOF rate measurement based on constant effective mobility in microchip CE,Wei Wang; Liang Zhao; Fang Zhou; Jian‐Rong Zhang; Jun‐Jie Zhu; Hong‐Yuan Chen,Abstract A new method for quickly determining low EOF rates (μ EOF) in microchip CE isdescribed. The measurement is based on the notion that the effective mobility (μ eff) of ananalyte is a constant in a certain BGE. The μ eff of an analyte is determined in a referencefast-electroosmosis microchip; and the apparent mobility (μ app) of the analyte can bedetermined in the microchip with unknown low electroosmosis; and then μ EOF in the low-electroosmosis microchip can be calculated according to the equation μ EOF= μ app− μ eff.By an indirect method or other conventional methods; μ eff can be easily measured in thereference microchip. The proposed method is particularly useful for low-electroosmosismeasurements in wall-modified microchannels.,Electrophoresis,2007,10

Here we demonstrate the resultsof an alternative dry etching process; namely; pulsed laser etching; for GaN and AIN. In thismethod; a KrF pulsed excimer laser (λ= 248 nm; τ= 30 ns) was used to etch epitaxial GaNand AIN films. The dependence of the etching characteristics on the laser energy densityand the number of pulses has been studied. The etch depth showed a linear dependenceon the number of pulses over a wide range of laser energy densities. The threshold intensityfor GaN etching was determined to be 0.33 J/cm 2. The etching rate was found to be a strongfunction of laser energy density. Above the threshold; the etch rate was found to be 300–1400 Å per pulse leading to etching rates of 0.1–1μm/sec depending upon the laser …,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,1997,10

Convection heat transfer due to protruded heat sources in an enclosure,L Chen; . KEYHANI; DR Pitts,WITH the continuing development of electronic technol-ogy; the effective cooling ofmicroelectronic components has become increasingly important. Natural convection playsan important role; since it provides simple; low-cost; reliable; maintenance-free; andelectromagnetic interferqncefree cooling. 1 Therefore; research work on natural convectionin fluid-filled enclosures is of current interest. 2 In some cases; the electronic componentscan be modeled as whole flat plates or as discrete flat arrays on a vertical wall. However; insome situations; the actual cooling configuration is of higher geometrical complexity; inwhich case the electronic components can only be considered as arrays protruding from avertical wall.

Robust Principal Components and Dispersion Matrices via Projection Pursuit.,Zhonglian Chen; Guoying Li,Abstract: This paper discusses a new kind of robust procedure for estimatingcovariance/correlation matrices and their principal components. Robust eigenvectors andeigenvalues of a covariance matrix are obtained by the projection pursuit method (PP) withrobust variance as a projection index. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the best ofthe three projection pursuit type procedures introduced in this study compares favorably withapproaches based on M-estimators of covariance: the estimate obtained by the newprocedure has about the same bias and variance as the best M-estimators; and a somewhatbetter breakdown point.(Author) Descriptors:* MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS;* COVARIANCE;*CORRELATION TECHNIQUES;* MATRIX THEORY; EIGENVECTORS; ANALYSIS OFVARIANCE; EIGENVALUES; MONTE CARLO METHOD; ESTIMATES; BIAS,*,1981,10

The preparation and tribological properties of surface modified zinc borate ultrafine powder as a lubricant additive in liquid paraffin,Chuanli Zhao; YK Chen; Yang Jiao; Adil Loya; GG Ren,Abstract This paper investigates the effects of surface modification of zinc borate ultrafinepowders (ZB UFPs) on their tribological properties as lubricant additives in liquid paraffin(LP). ZB UFPs were successfully modified by hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMOS) andoleic acid (OA). It is evident that HDTMOS modified zinc borate ultrafine powder (HDTMOS-ZB UFP) delivered a small conglomerate size; good stability in the organic solvent andsound anti-wear property. It has been observed that a continuous and tenacious tribo-film onthe worn surface generated from HDTMOS modified ZB UFP as a lubricant additive in LPplays an important role in the outstanding anti-wear property. It is suggested that HDTMOSmodified ZB UFP as a lubricant additive in LP has a great potential.,Tribology International,2014,9

N-glycosylation of the premembrane protein of Japanese encephalitis virus is critical for folding of the envelope protein and assembly of virus-like particles.,J Zai; L Mei; C Wang; S Cao; ZF Fu; H Chen; Y Song,Abstract Premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins; the major structural proteins ofJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV) each contain single potential N-glycosylation site. In thisstudy; the role of N-glycosylation of these proteins on their folding and activity wereinvestigated. Three mutant prM and/or E (prM-E) genes lacking N-glycosylation sites weregenerated by site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of the N-glycan on folding; secretionand cytotoxicity of mutant proteins were determined by comparison with their wild type (wt)counterparts. Removal of N-glycan from the prM protein resulted in a complete misfolding ofthe E protein and failure to form virus-like particles (VLPs). A similar removal of N-glycanfrom the E protein led to a low efficiency of its folding and VLPs formation. The secretion andcytotoxicity of the E protein was also markedly impaired in case the glycosylation sites in …,Acta virologica,2013,9

Design of a one-way nanovalve based on carbon nanotube junction and C 60,HY Chen; ZF Liu; XG Gong; DY Sun,Abstract We report the conceptual construction of a one-way nanovalve based on a carbonnanotube intramolecular junction and a C 60. Using molecular dynamics simulations; wedemonstrate the flow behavior of helium through the nanovalve as controlled by thepressure balance around C 60. The van der Waals interaction between C 60 and carbonnanotube keeps C 60 close to the junction; while the pressure balance around C 60 canjuggle it between two adsorption sites; which in turn closes or opens the nanovalve.,Microfluidics and Nanofluidics,2011,9
Syntaxin 16: unraveling cellular physiology through a ubiquitous SNARE molecule,Yanan Chen; Bin Qi Gan; Bor Luen Tang,Abstract Syntaxin 16 (Syx16) is member of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factorattachment protein receptor (SNARE) family of molecules that functions in membrane fusionin eukaryotic cells. A rather ubiquitously expressed; tail-anchored membrane proteinlocalized mainly at the trans-Golgi network (TGN); it mediates primarily retrogradeendosomal-TGN transport. In spite of its ubiquitous expression; Syx16 has specific andinteresting roles in the physiology of specialized cells; including Glut4 dynamics; dendriticoutgrowth-related membrane traffic; and cytokinesis. We discussed these physiologicalfunctions of Syx16 in the light of what is known of its subcellular localization; vesiculartrafficking pathways involved; cognate SNARE partners and other interacting proteins.Further; we speculate on some possible pathophysiological roles of Syx16.

Security and performance of group key agreement protocols,Shanyu Zheng; David Manz; Jim Alves-Foss; Yuzhe Chen,ABSTRACT Several group key protocols have been presented in the literature to enablesecrecy of communication among dynamic groups of participants. However; there is a lack ofconsistency in the literature in terms of operations supported and performance metrics of thevarious protocols. This makes it difficult for designers to choose the best protocol for theirspecific applications. To alleviate this problem we introduce a generic model of group keyexchange protocols which we use to prove security properties of the protocols. In addition;we introduce new performance metrics to be used to assist in uniformly comparing theseprotocols and then improve the performance of five protocols based on these operations andmetrics.,Proc.

Not only is the overpotential lower than that atthe commonly used carbon or platinum electrodes; but the coenzyme gives a cathodic peakat∼ 0.12 V which can be assigned to the reduction of the oxidized form. Since no mediatorfor the redox reaction of NAD+/NADH is present at the silver electrode surface; the workingelectrode is obviously stable and the reaction reported here is useful for electrochemicalstudies of the nicotinamide coenzyme.,Journal of The Electrochemical Society,1996,9

Backward path growth for efficient mobile sequential recommendation,Jianbin Huang; Xuejun Huangfu; Heli Sun; Hui Li; Peixiang Zhao; Hong Cheng; Qinbao Song,The problem of mobile sequential recommendation is to suggest a route connecting a set ofpick-up points for a taxi driver so that he/she is more likely to get passengers with less travelcost. Essentially; a key challenge of this problem is its high computational complexity. In thispaper; we propose a novel dynamic programming based method to solve the mobilesequential recommendation problem consisting of two separate stages: an offline pre-processing stage and an online search stage.

Efficient determination of distance thresholds for differential dependencies,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Hong Cheng,The importance of introducing distance constraints to data dependencies; such asdifferential dependencies (DDs); has recently been recognized. The differentialdependencies are tolerant to small variations; which enable them to apply to wide dataquality checking applications; such as detecting data violations. However; the determinationof distance thresholds for the differential dependencies is non-trivial. It often relies on a truthdata instance which embeds the distance constraints. To find useful distance thresholdpatterns from data; there are several guidelines of statistical measures to specify; eg;support; confidence and dependent quality. Unfortunately; given a data instance; usersmight not have any knowledge about the data distribution; thus it is very challenging to setthe right parameters. In this paper; we study the determination of distance thresholds for …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,8

We; along with other researchers;have recently found quantitative ultrasound to be effective as a skin toxicity assessment tool.Although more reliable than standard clinical evaluations (visual observation and palpation);the current procedure for ultrasound-based skin toxicity measurements requires manualdelineation of the skin layers (ie; epidermis-dermis and dermis-hypodermis interfaces) oneach ultrasound B-mode image. Manual skin segmentation is time consuming andsubjective. Moreover; radiation-induced skin injury may decrease image contrast betweenthe dermis and hypodermis; which increases the difficulty of delineation. Therefore; we havedeveloped an automatic skin segmentation tool (ASST) based on the active contour …,Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology,2013,8
Downregulation of Erbin in Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells promotes cell migration and induces trastuzumab resistance,Dan Liu; Ming Shi; Chenyang Duan; Hongyu Chen; Yabin Hu; Zhengyan Yang; Huijun Duan; Ning Guo,Abstract Erbin is ubiquitously expressed in normal epithelial tissues and constitutivelyassociates with Her2 at the basolateral membranes in epithelial cells. The inhibitory role ofErbin in ERK signaling has been demonstrated. However; whether the expression of Erbin isaltered in Her2-overexpressing breast cancer is unclear. There is little information regardingthe function of Erbin in cancer progression. In the present study; we demonstrate that thelevel of Erbin is significantly downregulated or lost in breast cancer tissues. Erbin deficiencyresulted in a dramatic enhancement in heregulin-induced AKT activation andoverexpression of Erbin not only significantly decreased the intensity of heregulin-inducedAKT phosphorylation but also shortened its duration in Her2-overexpressing breast cancercells. Knockdown of Erbin remarkably promotes cell migration; induces invasive …,Molecular immunology,2013,8
Effect of alkali metal ions co-doping on the structure and luminescent properties of phosphor Zn3 (BO3) 2: Eu3+,Nana Li; Yihua Hu; Zhongfei Mu; Haoyi Wu; Li Chen; Xiaojuan Wang,Abstract A series of the Zn 3 (BO 3) 2: Eu 3+ without or with alkali metal ions doping at a lowsintering temperature were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The XRD patternshows that all samples exhibit Zn 3 (BO 3) 2 crystalline phase. The samples co-doped withalkali metal ions have better crystallinity compared with the un-compensated ones. Thedifferent charge compensation approaches have no influence on the shape and position ofthe emission and excitation spectra. However; the luminescent intensity of samples hasbeen obviously enhanced with different alkali metal ions co-doping. The introduction of Li+can increase the red emission of Eu 3+ compared with the others. Thus; the volumecompensation and the equilibrium of mole number can be taken into consideration bycharge compensated (CC) approaches.,Displays,2013,8
Chebyshev super spectral viscosity method for water hammer analysis,Hongyu Chen; Hongjun Liu; Jianhua Chen; Lingjiu Wu,Abstract In this paper; a new fast and efficient algorithm; Chebyshev super spectral viscosity(SSV) method; is introduced to solve the water hammer equations. Compared with standardspectral method; the method's advantage essentially consists in adding a super spectralviscosity to the equations for the high wave numbers of the numerical solution. It canstabilize the numerical oscillation (Gibbs phenomenon) and improve the computationalefficiency while discontinuities appear in the solution. Results obtained from the Chebyshevsuper spectral viscosity method exhibit greater consistency with conventional water hammercalculations. It shows that this new numerical method offers an alternative way to investigatethe behavior of the water hammer in propellant pipelines.,Propulsion and Power Research,2013,8

Several centers used thallium-201 (Tl-201) asan alternative radiotracer for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Since Tl-201 is consideredby many as a suboptimal radiotracer; we sought to understand the impact of using Tl-201(during the Tc-99m shortage) upon downstream resource utilization. Methods and Results—We performed a retrospective study at the Ottawa Heart Institute of 7402 patients (60% male;mean age= 62.6±11.8 years) patients referred for MPI between May 2008 and January 2011(PRE_Tc-99m (2938 patients)); during (DURING_Tl-201 (2959 patients)); and after(POST_Tc-99m (1505 patients)) the Tc-99m shortage.

An improved direction finding algorithm based on toeplitz approximation,Qing Wang; Hua Chen; Guohuang Zhao; Bin Chen; Pichao Wang,In this paper; a novel direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm called the Toeplitz fourthorder cumulants multiple signal classification method (TFOC-MUSIC) algorithm is proposedthrough combining a fast MUSIC-like algorithm termed the modified fourth order cumulantsMUSIC (MFOC-MUSIC) algorithm and Toeplitz approximation. In the proposed algorithm;the redundant information in the cumulants is removed. Besides; the computationalcomplexity is reduced due to the decreased dimension of the fourth-order cumulants matrix;which is equal to the number of the virtual array elements. That is; the effective arrayaperture of a physical array remains unchanged. However; due to finite sampling snapshots;there exists an estimation error of the reduced-rank FOC matrix and thus the capacity of DOAestimation degrades. In order to improve the estimation performance; Toeplitz …,Sensors,2013,8

Parameter-free determination of distance thresholds for metric distance constraints,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Hong Cheng,The importance of introducing distance constraints to data dependencies; such asdifferential dependencies (DDs)[28]; has recently been recognized. The metric distanceconstraints are tolerant to small variations; which enable them apply to wide data qualitychecking applications; such as detecting data violations. However; the determination ofdistance thresholds for the metric distance constraints is non-trivial. It often relies on a truthdata instance which embeds the distance constraints. To find useful distance thresholdpatterns from data; there are several guidelines of statistical measures to specify; eg;support; confidence and dependent quality. Unfortunately; given a data instance; usersmight not have any knowledge about the data distribution; thus it is very challenging to setthe right parameters.

On chip steady liquid–gas phase separation for flexible generation of dissolved gas concentration gradient,Bi-Yi Xu; Shan-Wen Hu; Xiao-Na Yan; Xing-Hua Xia; Jing-Juan Xu; Hong-Yuan Chen,In this study; steady liquid–gas phase separation is realized by applying a hydrophobicsmall microchannel array (SMA) to bridge two large microchannels; one for liquid phase andone for gas phase. In this structure; a capillary pressure difference between that in the SMAand the larger channel results in a steady liquid–gas interface. The generated liquid–gasinterface allows for fast gas dissolving speed. By coupling the liquid–gas interface with aone directional fluidic field; a steady dissolved gas concentration gradient (DgCG) isgenerated. The DgCG distribution is easily designable for linear or exponential modes;providing improved flexibility for gas participated processes on chip. To demonstrate itsapplicability; a CO2 DgCG chip is fabricated and applied for screening CaCO3 crystalgrowth conditions in the DgCG chip.

An effective non-HT circle detection for centers and radii,Li-Qin Jia; Hong-Min Liu; Zhi-Heng Wang; Hong Chen,We present a non-HT circle detection algorithm applied to search the centers and radii ofcircular or partially circular components present in the image. The line coincident with thegradient vector of each edge point and passing through the corresponding edge point isdefined first. Then; for every pixel in the image; the number of the lines passing through thispixel is defined as the energy of the pixel. The feature circle energy (FCE) distribution map ofthe whole image is therefore obtained and the local maxima are corresponding to thecenters of potential circles. For the detection of radius; the gradient magnitudes in assignedregion are accumulated and its variation defined as the feature circle radius (FCR) iscomputed who has maximum when the radius of the region is equal to that of the circle.Synthetic images and natural images are used to test the capability of the proposed …,Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC); 2011 International Conference on,2011,8
Arcing discharge and gas generation characteristics of transformer oil under combined AC and DC voltage,YX Zhou; XX Jiang; WJ Chen; YC Sha; QH Sun; HY Zhang,The valve winding of converter transformer withstands several types of voltage; includingAC; DC; combined AC-DC and polarity reversal voltage. We constructed a combined AC-DChigh voltage source; and studied the arcing discharge and gas generation characteristics oftransformer oil by using needle-plate model. The results show that oil gap under DC voltageand combined AC-DC voltage is much easier to breakdown than that under AC voltage; andthe breakdown voltage is related to the ripple factor. The lowerer the ripple factor is; thelower the breakdown voltage will be. A polarization process of the bridge theory is adoptedto explain this physical phenomenon. The ratio of every kind of gas is the same under AC;DC and combined AC-DC voltage; showing that the three-ratio method is still suitable forarcing discharge under DC and combined AC-DC voltage.

A postulated role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the transformation and proliferation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC),Bin Huang; Huangqin Chen; Mingwen Fan,Summary Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy andis a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. A strong association of oralcancer with high-risk HPVs infection underlines the importance of the virus in thepathogenesis of these squamous cell carcinomas. We postulate that HPV may contribute tothe carcinogenesis of oral epithelial and function to stimulate transformation andproliferation of OSCC. The appropriate method; which may involve immunoprevention;immunotherapy; or immunomodulatory; needs to be developed. Not only humoral immunity;but also cellular immunity must be part of this process.,Medical hypotheses,2008,8

Synthesis and field emission of single-crystalline copper vanadate nanobelts,Changjie Mao; Xiaojie Wang; Xingcai Wu; Jun-Jie Zhu; Hong-Yuan Chen,Abstract Single-crystalline nanobelts of a nonstoichiometric compound Cu 1.55 V 2 O 6.55;with a thickness of 40–60 nm; width of 50–300 nm and length of several micrometers; havebeen synthesized on a large scale by a hydrothermal method. The structures andmorphologies of the nanobelts were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction; x-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electronmicroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. A probable growthmechanism has also been discussed. The nanobelts exhibit a turn-on field of 11.0 V µm− 1;which is defined as the macroscopic field required to produce a current density of 10 µA cm−2. It is anticipated that the nanobelts can serve as a candidate material for future fieldemitters.,Nanotechnology,2007,8
Photochromic effect in LiNbO 3: Fe: Co,Wenbo Yan; Yangxian Li; Lihong Shi; Hongjian Chen; Shiguo Liu; Ling Zhang; Ziheng Huang; Shaolin Chen; Yongfa Kong,In this paper; Co_2O_3 was codoped in LiNbO_3: Fe crystals. It was found that Co codopingcan give rise to the strong photochromic effect in LiNbO_3: Fe. Based on the UV-VIS-NIRabsorption spectra; photorefractive sensitivities; and EPR results for both virgin andsensitized states of the crystal; the photochromic mechanism in this material was suggestedas follows. During sensitization; electrons transfer from O^ 2-to Fe^ 3+ directly while holesare thermally excited from O-into the valence band and then partly trapped by Co^ 2+; whichleads to the darkening of the crystal. In bleaching process; the electrons are excited from Fe^2+ to the conduction band by green light and recombine with the holes on the Co^ 2+ level.Sensitizing/bleaching experiments were also carried out in LiNbO_3: Fe: Co crystals. Fastsensitization found for this material is beneficial to two-color recording.,Optics Express,2007,8
Correction in female PKU mice by repeated administration of mPAH cDNA using phiBT1 integration system,Li Chen; Savio LC Woo,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder secondary to a hepatic deficiency ofphenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that predisposes affected children to develop severe andirreversible mental retardation. We have previously reported the complete and permanentcorrection of the hyperphenylalaninemic and hypopigmentation phenotypes in male; but notfemale; PKU mice after genome-targeted delivery of murine PAH (mPAH) complementaryDNA (cDNA) in a phiBT1 bacteriophage integration system. Here we show that sequentialadministration of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–and red fluorescent protein (RFP)–expressing cassettes in the phiBT1 integration system led to distinct and non-overlappingpopulations of green and red fluorescent hepatocytes in vivo.

Infection of HeLa cells by avian infectious bronchitis virus is dependent on cell status,HY Chen; AZ Guo; B Peng; MF Zhang; HY Guo; HC Chen,To investigate the adaptation of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in a human cell linemay be beneficial to understanding the potential mechanisms of coronavirus interspeciesinfection. The current study addressed the poor replication of IBV in the HeLa human cellline demonstrated in previous reports. We showed that IBV strains M41; H52; H120 andGray could be propagated in HeLa cells with distinct cytopathic effect. The virus titre infreshly dispersed HeLa cells was 1000-fold higher than in cell monolayers. Trypsin was notthe determinant for the viral replication; suggesting that the restriction of IBV replication inHeLa cells is the result of intracellular events rather than the binding to or fusion with hostcells. These IBV strains replicated to an average titre of 103.4±0.2/0.1 ml median tissueculture infectious doses in freshly dispersed HeLa cells and maintained this titre for the …,Avian pathology,2007,8

Signature for rotational to vibrational evolution along the yrast line,SF Shen; YB Chen; FR Xu; SJ Zheng; B Tang; TD Wen,Abstract The excitation spectra of nuclei in the regions 150< A< 190 and 220< A< 250 arecommonly considered as showing characteristics of the rotational motion. In the presentwork; however; there is evidence indicating that the nuclei can evolve from rotation tovibration. We have used two simple models to discuss the collective motions of a nucleus fordifferent spin ranges. In addition; in order to get the insight into the rotational-like propertiesof nuclei; as an example; shape calculations using the total Routhian surfaces (TRS) modelhave been carried out for positive-parity states in Gd 156. Also we have shown the result ofthe nucleus Ru 102 which is given as an example of the reverse transition; ie; vibration torotation. The TRS plots reveal that; with increasing spin; the former nucleus becomes slightlysoft in γ and β deformations; while the latter one becomes rigid in the γ deformation.,Physical Review C,2007,8

The results show that cyclicstrain-stress curves are symmetrical due to the clamps; and the alloy behaves cyclichardening at lower strain amplitude and behaves cyclic softening at higher strain amplitudeunder cyclic straining; therefore N18 alloy does not follow Manson law; however; undermultigrade strain cycling (MSC) with different loading ways; stress amplitude response of thealloy remains stable or cyclic constitutive relationships of the alloy tubes are closed eachother. Finally; several life-estimated equations for the alloy tubes were presented.(authors),Atomic Energy Science and Technology,2007,8

The Ag-TDCN thin film was prepared on a highly oriented pyrolyticgraphite (HOPG) substrate using an ionized-cluster-beam (ICB) deposition method. Markscan be created on the thin film by employing a voltage pulse between the STM tip andsurface of the HOPG substrate. The size of the created marks is about 50 nm and thecorresponding data storage density is about 10 11 bits/cm 2. The mechanism for the datastorage can be attributed to the conductance transition in the complex system. This resultshows a great potential for this new kind of organometallic composite system to findapplication in ultrahigh density data storage.,Chemical physics letters,1997,8

Measurement of wall deformation and flow limitation in a mechanical trachea,C Walsh; PA Sullivan; JS Hansen; L-W Chen,Abstract A mechanical model of the human trachea is investigated experimentally. Amodified version of an earlier model; it consists of a square sectioned rigid tube in which partof one wall is removed; and replaced by a prestretched flat latex membrane. Air is drawnfrom atmosphere through an inlet into the rigid upstream tube; it then flows through theflexible section and finally through a rigid section Into a plenum chamber where suction isapplied. As the membrane collapses in response to flow; the transmural pressure anddeflection are measured at the mid-point. These values are used in conjunction with a finitedeformation membrane wall theory to determine the elastic constant in a nonlinear materialconstitutive equation. This equation is used to predict the tube law. Results show that theflow limits at the long wave speed predicted by this law. Thus it behaves as a …,Journal of biomechanical engineering,1995,8
The study of differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry of co (II)/1‐nitroso‐2‐naphthol chelate,Jilin Han; Hongyuan Chen,Abstract Cobalt (II)/1-nitroso-2-naphthol chelate in citrate/ammonium citrate (pH 8.6) buffersolution is studied by adsorptive stripping voltammetry on a static mercury drop electrode(SMDE). The adsorbed chelate yields one distinct peak at− 0.51 V; which can be utilized toquantify trace cobalt. The interfacial and redox behavior are evaluated by cyclic voltammetryand pulse polarography. The effect of accumulation potential; accumulation time; andconcentration of ligand on the reduction peak currents of the chelate have been discussed.Possible interference metal ions are also investigated.

The tremendous steadystate mass transport efficiency makes it possible; using a microelectrode; to determinekinetic parameters from the steady state measurements. Examples of this are given byFleischmann et al.[6; 7] and Dayton et al.[8] in studies of CE; EC'; ECE and DISPI reactionswith microelectrodes. However; the mathematical methods used in these papers aresophisticated. In this work; we avoid using complicated mathematical techniques to solve …,Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,1993,8

Robust Projection Pursuit Estimator for Dispersion Matrices and Principal Components.,Guoying Li; Zhonglian Chen,Abstract: This paper proposes and discusses the ROBUST PROJECTION PURSUITESTIMATOR for dispersion matrices and their principal components. This estimator findsrobust principal components by searching; successively; for directions which maximize(minimize) a robust estimate of scale; the estimate of the dispersion matrix is constructedfrom the estimated principal components. These estimators are shown below (under mildconditions) to have a number of desirable properties. They are orthogonally equivariant and;within any elliptic underlying density family; asymptotically affinely equivariant. Furthermore;at elliptic densities; they are consistent and weakly continuous (ie; qualitatively robust).Finally; they have good quantitative robustness-their breakdown point can be as high as 1/2.The robust projection pursuit approach is a promising alternatives to other estimators of …,*,1981,8

Cooperative control design for non-holonomic chained-form systems,Ke-Cai Cao; Bin Jiang; YangQuan Chen,Consensus and formation control problems for multiple non-holonomic chained-formsystems are solved in this paper. For consensus problem; based on cascaded structure ofthe chained-form systems; it amounts to solving two consensus subproblems of two linearsubsystems transformed from the original system. With the obtained consensus protocolsand the method of virtual structure; decentralised formation controllers can then bedesigned. According to different desired motion patterns of the entire group; both theformation tracking and formation stabilisation problems can be considered. The significanceof this paper lies in adapting theories from non-autonomous cascaded systems forcooperative control design for non-holonomic chained-form systems.

Fatigue life prediction of magnetorheological elastomers subjected to dynamic equi-biaxial cyclic loading,Yanfen Zhou; Stephen Jerrams; Anthony Betts; Lin Chen,Abstract Prediction of fatigue life is of great significance in ensuring that dynamically loadedrubber components exhibit safety and reliability in service. In this text; the dynamic equi-biaxial fatigue behaviour of magnetorheological elastomer (MREs) using a bubble inflationmethod is described. Wöhler (S–N) curves for both isotropic and anisotropic MREs wereproduced by subjecting the compounds to cycling over a range of stress amplitudes (σ a)between 0.75 MPa and 1.4 MPa. Changes in physical properties; including variation instress–strain relations and complex modulus (E*) during the fatigue process were analysed.It was found that the complex modulus of MRE samples decreased throughout the entirefatigue test and failure took place at a limiting value of approximately 1.228 MPa±4.38% forisotropic MREs and 1.295±10.33% for anisotropic MREs.

Efficient processing of $ $ k $ $ k-hop reachability queries,James Cheng; Zechao Shang; Hong Cheng; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We study the problem of answering k-hop reachability queries in a directed graph;ie; whether there exists a directed path of length kk; from a source query vertex to a targetquery vertex in the input graph. The problem of k k-hop reachability is a general problem ofthe classic reachability (where k= ∞ k=∞). Existing indexes for processing classicreachability queries; as well as for processing shortest path distance queries; are notapplicable or not efficient for processing k k-hop reachability queries. We propose anefficient index for processing k k-hop reachability queries.

Luminescence properties of Ba3Si6O9N4: Eu2+ green-emitting phosphors for white LEDs,Lanlan Yu; Youjie Hua; Hong Chen; Degang Deng; Huanping Wang; Hongping Ma; Shiqing Xu,Abstract A green-emitting phosphor; Eu 2+-activated Ba 3 Si 6 O 9 N 4 phosphor; wassynthesized by a conventional solid state reaction method. X-ray diffraction patterns showedthat the synthesized phosphor sintered at 1300° C for 6 h was a Ba 3 Si 6 O 9 N 4 purephase. It could be efficiently excited by UV–blue light (280–500 nm) and showed a singleintense broad emission band (470–625 nm). Suitable excitation range makes it match wellwith the emission of near-UV or blue LEDs. Concentration quenching of the doped-Eu 2+ions occurred at x= 0.15; and the critical distance is calculated to be about 1.807 nm bytheory of energy transfer.

Results from laser distribution analysis show thatpolyelectrolyte additives have low impact on the average particle size and distribution of themicrospheres. The negatively charged HA increases the drug loading efficiency as well asthe amount of HA in microspheres. Burst release can be observed in the groups with thepolyelectrolyte additives. The release rate decreases with the amount of HA inside themicrospheres in all negatively charged polyelectrolyte-added microsphere groups.,Bio-medical materials and engineering,2014,7

Error analysis of coefficient-based regularized algorithm for density-level detection,Hong Chen; Zhibin Pan; Luoqing Li; Yuanyan Tang,In this letter; we consider a density-level detection (DLD) problem by a coefficient-basedclassification framework with-regularizer and data-dependent hypothesis spaces. Althoughthe data-dependent characteristic of the algorithm provides flexibility and adaptivity for DLD;it leads to difficulty in generalization error analysis. To overcome this difficulty; an errordecomposition is introduced from an established classification framework. On the basis ofthis decomposition; the estimate of the learning rate is obtained by using Rademacheraverage and stepping-stone techniques. In particular; the estimate is independent of thecapacity assumption used in the previous literature.,Neural computation,2013,7

Replication of HCV in human cellsrequires the action of the HCV non-structural protein 3 (NS3); which exhibits both proteaseand helicase activities. Since there are numerous NS3 protease inhibitors but few NS3helicase inhibitors; the goal here was to develop specific NS3 helicase inhibitors. Duringassay development; we discovered that trace components in the dye mixtures thioflavine Sand primuline were potent inhibitors of the NS3 helicase.

Bayesian network structure learning from attribute uncertain data,Wenting Song; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng; Hongyan Liu; Jun He; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract In recent years there has been a growing interest in Bayesian Network learningfrom uncertain data. While many researchers focus on Bayesian Network learning from datawith tuple uncertainty; Bayesian Network structure learning from data with attributeuncertainty gets little attention. In this paper we make a clear definition of attribute uncertaindata and Bayesian Network Learning problem from such data. We propose a structurelearning method named DTAU based on information theory. The algorithm assumes that thestructure of a Bayesian network is a tree. It avoids enumerating all possible worlds. Thedependency tree is computed with polynomial time complexity. We conduct experiments todemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The experiments show theclustering results on uncertain dataset by our dependency tree are acceptable.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2012,7
A digitally assisted; pseudo-resistor-less amplifier in 65nm CMOS for neural recording applications,Yi Chen; Arindam Basu; Minkyu Je,A novel scheme for amplification in neural recording systems is proposed in this work thatallows us to remove the largepseudo-resistors' needed to bias the typically used capacitiveamplifier topology. Comparison and reset circuits are implemented with the core amplifier tofold the output waveform of amplifier into a preset range for digitizing by an ADC. Areconstruction algorithm is then used in the digital domain to recover the amplified signalfrom the folded waveform. By removing the pseudo-resistors; higher robustness; less noisein LFP band and better matching and programmability of high pass corner can be achievedin the proposed design. Simulation and measurement results are presented from a prototypefabricated in 65nm CMOS. The presented scheme is general and can be used with anycapacitive amplifier.,Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS); 2012 IEEE 55th International Midwest Symposium on,2012,7
Semi-supervised clustering of graph objects: A subgraph mining approach,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jiong Yang; Jeffery Xu Yu; Hongliang Fei; Jun Huan,Abstract Semi-supervised clustering has recently received a lot of attention in the literature;which aims to improve the clustering performance with limited supervision. Most existingsemi-supervised clustering studies assume that the data is represented in a vector space;eg; text and relational data. When the data objects have complex structures; eg; proteins andchemical compounds; those semi-supervised clustering methods are not directly applicableto clustering such graph objects. In this paper; we study the problem of semi-supervisedclustering of data objects which are represented as graphs. The supervision information is inthe form of pairwise constraints of must-links and cannot-links. As there is no predefinedfeature set for the graph objects; we propose to use discriminative subgraph patterns as thefeatures. We design an objective function which incorporates the constraints to guide the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,7

Elucidating the molecular mechanism of panicle enclosure will behelpful for solving the problem of panicle enclosure in male sterile lines and creating newgermplasms in rice. We acquired a monogenic recessive enclosed panicle mutant; namedas esp2 (enclosed shorter panicle 2); from the tissue culture progeny of indica rice cultivarMinghui-86. In the mutant; panicles were entirely enclosed by flag leaf sheaths and theuppermost internode was almost completely degenerated; but the other internodes did nothave obvious changes in length. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutant phenotype wascontrolled by a recessive gene; which could be steadily inherited and was not affected bygenetic background.

Influence of strain rate and temperature on necking transition in a polydomain smectic main chain elastomer,Daniel M Lentz; Huipeng Chen; Ziniu Yu; Harshad P Patil; Charles A Crane; Ronald C Hedden,Abstract Smectic main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers (MCLCE) with polydomainmorphology are rare examples of elastomers that can form a neck and undergo colddrawing under tension. However; not all previous studies of the mechanical behavior ofsmectic MCLCE reported neck formation. The mechanical response of a polydomain smecticMCLCE has therefore been characterized by elongation at varying strain rates andtemperatures to identify factors favoring mechanical instability. Yielding and neck formationare increasingly favored as the strain rate increases at constant temperature; or as thetemperature decreases toward T g. As cold drawing proceeds; significant creep occurscontinuously within the neck; in contrast to the behavior of certain linear polymers thatexhibit a “natural” draw ratio.

Preparation of expanded graphite-based composites by one step impregnation,Chengbao Liu; Zhigang Chen; Hong Chen; Zhi Miao; Meng Fu,Abstract A new method for preparing expanded graphite-based composites (EGCs) wasdeveloped. The obtained samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM); transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption. The experimentalresults indicated that the EGCs was not simply mechanical mixture of EG and activatedcarbon; instead the activated carbon was coated on the surface of interior and externalpores of the EG in the form of thin carbon layer. The thickness of the activated carbon layerwas nearly one hundred nanometers by calculation. It was shown that the higher theimpregnation ratio and the activation temperature were; the easier the porosity developmentwould be. And the BET surface area and the total pore volume were as high as 1978 m 2/gand 0.9917 cm 3/g respectively at 350° C with an impregnation ratio of 0.9.,Journal of Wuhan University of Technology-Mater.

An EXIT-chart aided design procedure for near-capacity N-component parallel concatenated codes,Hong Chen; Robert G Maunder; Lajos Hanzo,Shannon's channel capacity specifies the upper bound on the amount of bits per channeluse. In this paper; we explicitly demonstrate that twin-component turbo codes suffer from acapacity loss; when the component code rate is less than unity; which is shown by exploitingthe so-called area properties of Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts. This capacityloss is unavoidable for twin-component turbo codes; when the overall turbo coding rate isless than 1/2; while multiple-component turbo codes are capable of overcoming it by usingunity-rate component codes. In order to demonstrate that multiple-component turbo codesare capable of exhibiting a better asymptotic performance; the minimum Signal Noise Ratio(SNR) required for the EXIT charts to have open convergence tunnels is used as our metric;which is referred to as' the open tunnel SNR threshold'. Furthermore; the employment of …,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010); 2010 IEEE,2010,7

However; theunderlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study was conducted to investigate the effectsof HCMV infection on the viability of megakaryocytic CHRF-288-11 cells and the underlyingmechanisms involved. RT-PCR for determining mRNA expression of HCMV immediate earlygene 1 and Western blot for measuring protein expression of late HCMV gene pp65 showedthat CHRF-288-11 cells were susceptible to HCMV infection. HCMV infection reduced theviability of CHRF-288-11 cells via apoptosis in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Bothcaspase 3 and c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway were activated in the HCMV-treated CHRF-288-11 cells. z-DEVD-fmk (a caspase inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK …,International journal of hematology,2010,7

Characterization and localization of the vacuolar-type ATPase in the midgut cells of silkworm (Bombyx mori),Huajun Yang; Huiqing Chen; Keping Chen; Qin Yao; Guoli Zhao; Chao Wu; Peng Lv; Lin Wang,The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multifunctional enzyme that consists of severalsubunits. Subunit B is a part of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The result of the RTPCRsuggested that the V-ATPase B subunit is a ubiquitous gene. 24 h after the larvae wereinfected with the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV); the expression level of the V-ATPase B subunit in the midgut of the resistant strain NB was about 3 times higher than inthe susceptible strain 306; and then the expression level of the V-ATPase B subunitdecreased rapidly to a very low level. This indicated that the virus may cause a lot ofchanges of physiological conditions in the midgut. Localization of the V-ATPase B subunitwas attempted in midgut cells of Bombyx mori by immunohistochemistry.

Profiting from a contrarian application of technical trading rules in the US stock market,Nauzer Balsara; Jason Chen; Lin Zheng,Abstract The variance ratio test suggests that we cannot reject the random walk nullhypothesis for three major US stock market indexes between 1990 and 2007. Moreover; wefind that the naïve forecasting model based on the random walk assumption frequentlygenerates more accurate forecasts than those generated by the autoregressive integratedmoving average forecasting model. Consistent with this finding; we find that the regularapplication of three commonly used technical trading rules (the moving average crossoverrule; the channel breakout rule and the Bollinger band breakout rule) underperform the buy-and-hold strategy between 1990 and 2007. However; we observe significant positive returnson trades generated by the contrarian version of these three technical trading rules; evenafter considering a 0.5 per cent transaction costs on all trades.,Journal of Asset Management,2009,7
Enzyme enhanced quantitative determination of multiple DNA targets based on capillary electrophoresis,Xuemei Li; Zhiming Zhan; Shusheng Zhang; Hongyuan Chen,Abstract In the current paper; enzyme enhanced simultaneous quantitative determination ofmultiple DNA targets based on capillary electrophoresis (CE) was described. We used threebiotin-modified DNA probes; which reacted with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase(avidin-HRP) conjugate to obtain the HRP labeled probes; to hybridize with threecorresponding targets. The resulting mixture containing double-strand DNA (dsDNA)-HRP;excess single-strand DNA (ssDNA)-HRP and remaining avidin-HRP was separated bycapillary electrophoresis; and then the system of HRP catalyzing H 2 O 2/o-aminophenol(OAP) reaction was adopted. The catalytic product was detected with electrochemicaldetection. With this protocol; the limits of quantification for the hybridization assay of 21-; 39-and 80-mer DNA fragments were of 1.2× 10− 11; 2.4× 10− 11 and 3.0× 10− 11 M …,Journal of Chromatography A,2009,7
Diffusion through a molecular ball check valve composed of a C 60 molecule and a nanotube cap,DY Sun; HY Chen; JW Liu; XG Gong; Zhi-Feng Liu,Abstract A nanostructure; consisting of C 60 enclosed within a carbon nanotube near itscone shaped cap; is shown to behave like a ball check valve; a pressure-driven device forthe storage of fluid. The van der Waals force acts like a spring that traps C 60 near the capsection with a potential well around 1 eV. The restricted interstitial space around the valveproduces a volume difference that forces C 60 near the top center of the cap and thereforeblocks the outward diffusion. It is estimated that such a mechanism can producenanocapsules with internal pressure up to 40 GPa or above.,Physical Review B,2009,7

On the influent factors for the formation of severe acid rain band in Jiangxi Province,Ji-li He; HW Chen; XH Hu; Kai Chen,A numerical simulation technique is adopted to draw the surface projection map and itsisograms of the pH values in the precipitation over Jiangxi Province. It is found that a severeacid-rain band is formed along the southern-north direction of Nanchang-Yingtan-Linchuan-Jian-Ganzhou in the Province; taking a shape of “r”. It is discussed and pointed out that thisdirection of the formed acidrain band coincides with the atmospheric trade wind circulationand the latitudinal circulation of the subtropical high-pressure band. It is proposed that thesulfide minerals in the wasted ore piles in the mines over the Province are the main sourcesof the major acidifying substances of sever acidrain. Furthermore; it reveals a regular patternthat the pH value of the precipitation over the Province is varying with the seasonal southernnorth movement of the subtropical high-pressure ridge.,CHINA ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-CHINESE EDITION-,2000,7
Ultrahigh density data storage in an organic film with a scanning tunneling microscope,SM Hou; XY Zhao; C Yang; ZQ Xue; WJ Yang; HY Chen,A nanometer-scale recording technique was demonstrated on N-(3-nitrobenzylidene)–p-phenylenediamine (NBPDA) organic thin films with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM).NBPDA thin films were fabricated by vacuum thermal deposition. The results of ultraviolet-visible absorption and infrared transmission spectra showed that the structure of the NBPDAfilm was the same as that of NBPDA crystal. An atomic force microscope was utilized tocharacterize the surface morphology of the NBPDA film. Data were recorded by applyingvoltage pulses between the tip and the substrate. The current–voltage characteristicsmeasured by the STM indicated that the local electrical property changed from an insulatingproperty into a metallic property after the data were written.

Voltammetric Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay for Trace α-Fetoprotein in Human Serum using O-; M-and P-Aminophenol as Substrates,Shusheng Zhang; Kui Jiao; Hongyuan Chen,ABSTRACT Three voltammetric enzyme-linked immunoassays based on new systems of o-;m-and p-aminophenol-H2O2-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) have been developed andused for the detection of α-fetoprotein (α FP) in human serum. HRP or labelled HRPcatalyzes the oxidation reactions of o-; m-and p-aminophenol with H2O2; the products ofwhich produce three sensitive voltammetric peaks at potentials of− 0.87 V;− 0.46 V and−0.45 V (vs. SCE) in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer solution; respectively. By using thesevoltammetric peaks; the detection limits of α FP are 1.25 ng/mL; 0.5 ng/mL and 0.2 ng/mL;respectively; and the linear ranges 1.25-400 ng/mL; 0.5-400 ng/mL and 0.2-400 ng/mL;respectively. The detection limits of α FP with these methods are lower than that with theenzyme-linked immunosorbent spectrophotometric assay (ELISA).,*,1999,7
A new method for the voltammetric response of hemoglobin,Genxi Li; Hongyuan Chen; Dexu Zhu,Abstract Hemoglobin (Hb) could give a voltammetric response after it was acted on by thesurfactant dodecyl benzene sodium sulfonate (DBS) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Themechanism might be the enhancement of the adsorption process when there was surfactantin the protein solution. Moreover; the macromolecules might open their electroactivesections after they interacted with the hydrophobic groups of the surfactant. Comparativestudies showed that DBS could make Hb present a more welcome result than SDS since ithad an extra benzene ring. On the other hand; since surfactant was a denaturant to Hb aswell and the electrode surface might be fouled with it; a negative effect of the surfactantshould be considered in the meantime.,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,1996,7
Dominant photogenerated valley current in a double‐barrier resonant‐tunneling diode,HS Li; LP Chen; YW Chen; KL Wang; DS Pan; JM Liu,Dominant photogenerated valley current has been observed in an optically‐excitedInGaAs/AlAs double‐barrier resonant‐tunneling diode. The photogenerated valley current inthe resonant‐tunneling diode varies with the optical power level. Under intense illumination;the photogenerated valley current increases to such a high level that it becomes dominantover the peak current. As a consequence; the negative differential resistance of the device isremoved. The observed photogenerated valley current is described by photogeneratingelectron‐hole pairs in the depletion region adjacent to the double‐barrier structure.Transient behavior of the photogenerated carriers is also studied. The observed dominantphotogenerated valley current may have useful applications.,Applied physics letters,1994,7

By using a treatment ofsaturated heat conduction developed in a previous paper; we study the penetration of electronsfrom a hot medium into a nearby cold medium; and the behaviour of the resulting heat flux. Thetime evolution of the process is also investigated. If radiative losses cannot balance Coulombheating; a heat front propagates into the cold medium. Instead; an equilibrium profile is asymptoticallyreached in case radiative losses are able to quench Coulomb heating. Large scale …,Astronomy and Astrophysics,1994,7

Approximately median-unbiased estimation of autoregressive models with applications to us macroeconomic and financial time series,Donald WK Andrews; Hong-Yuan Chen,This paper introduces approximately median-unbiased estimators for univariate AR (p)models with time trends. Confidence intervals also are considered. The methods are appliedto the Nelson-Plosser macroeconomic data series; the extended Nelson-Plossermacroeconomic data series; and some annual stock dividend and price series. The resultsshow that most of the series exhibit substantially greater persistence than least squaresestimates and some Bayesian estimates suggest. For example; for the extended Nelson-Plosser data set; eight of the fourteen series are estimated to have a unit root; while six areestimated to be trend stationary. In contrast; the least squares estimates indicate trendstationarity for all of the series.,*,1992,7

The role of interleukin family in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)-induced immunotoxicity,Hangjun Zhang; Wendi Fang; Dandan Wang; Nana Gao; Ying Ding; Chao Chen,Abstract Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); a prominent perfluorinated compound (PFC); hasbeen widely detected in natural water bodies worldwide. In this study; zebrafish (Danio rerio)was exposed to nominal concentrations of PFOA (0.05; 0.1; 0.5; and 1 mg/L) for 21 d. Afterexposure; each fish was decapitated; and the spleen was removed to detect the expressionpatterns of P65 transcription factor; myeloid differentiation 88; relative interleukins (ILs); andantibody genes. PFOA can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine at a low exposureconcentration (0.05 mg/L) and can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine at higher exposureconcentrations (≥ 0.1 mg/L). The results of linear correlation analysis indicate thatMyd88/NF-κB pathway is one of the important pathways to mediate inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β and IL-21) in zebrafish spleen.

Shape optimisation of the support section of a tunnel at great depths,AZ Lu; HY Chen; Y Qin; N Zhang,Abstract The shape optimisation of a cavity is typically performed without considering theprevious support; which may significantly reduce the practical significance of such analyses.Even when an excavation section is optimised; failure of the surrounding rock in a tunnelcannot be prevented in the presence of excessive in situ stress. Thus; a support should beestablished to protect the stability of a tunnel from the failure of the surrounding rock. Thisstudy examines the optimal shape of the support that satisfies the optimisation criterion;which minimises the largest tangential stress along the inner edge of the support; for aspecific net tunnel size and support strength. The optimisation process is to solve a series offorward problems using the conformal mapping method for a plane elasticity complexfunction. The tangential stress along the inner edge of the support is selected as the …,Computers and Geotechnics,2014,6

Investigation of dimethyl ether combustion instabilities in a partially-premixed gas turbine model combustor using high-speed laser diagnostics,Patton Allison; Yuntao Chen; James F Driscoll,Combustion instabilities in gas turbine engines often give rise to acoustic resonances.These resonances occur as manifestations of different acoustic modes; of which a single ormultiple modes may be present. In this work; the acoustic behavior of a gas turbine modelcombustor; developed at DLR Stuttgart by W. Meier et al.; was investigated using dimethylether (DME). The equivalence ratio and air mass flow rate were systematically varied. Theresults did not correspond to any one instability mechanism. It is concluded that; in thecurrent burner configuration; integrated-acoustics occur that involve a combination ofmechanisms; including a Helmholtz-type resonance from the plenum and convective-acoustic effects. To understand the instability; accurate measurements are needed of thecorrelation between heat release rate fluctuations and pressure fluctuations. Thus heat …,*,2014,6

In this study;we examined the association of five potentially functional VEGFR-2 polymorphisms withglioma risk in a Chinese Han population. Three SNPs; rs2071559; rs7667298 andrs2305948; showed a statistically significant increased association with the risk of glioma(P= 0.006; 0.005; and 0.012; respectively). Both haplotype and diplotype analysesconsistently revealed that subjects carrying two copies of the haplotype “CGT” had a 42%reduced glioma risk compared with their respective noncarriers. Our findings suggested thatVEGFR-2 gene variants might contribute to glioma susceptibility.,Journal of Molecular Neuroscience,2012,6

The maximum static water contact angle (WCA) of the super-hydrophobicsurface was 157.5 º±2.0 º and the contact angle hysteresis was less than 3º. Thesuperhydrophobic property is attributed to the micro-nanoporous surface morphology andstearic acid. The pore size on the surface of anodic aluminum oxide is an important factor forcontrolling the superhydrophobic adhesiveness. The superhydrophobic surface is a factor toreduce device-associated infection and can be used in metal packaging practice.,Applied Mechanics and Materials,2012,6

Onset of double-diffusive convection in a rectangular cavity with stress-free upper boundary,Zhi-Wu Chen; Jie-Min Zhan; Yok-Sheung Li; Yu-Hua Nie,Double-diffusive buoyancy convection in an open-top rectangular cavity with horizontaltemperature and concentration gradients is considered. Attention is restricted to the casewhere the opposing thermal and solutal buoyancy effects are of equal magnitude (buoyancyratio R ρ=− 1). In this case; a quiescent equilibrium solution exists and can remain stable upto a critical thermal Grashof number Gr c. Linear stability analysis and direct numericalsimulation show that depending on the cavity aspect ratio A; the first primary instability canbe oscillatory; while that in a closed cavity is always steady. Near a codimension-two point;the two leading real eigenvalues merge into a complex coalescence that later produces asupercritical Hopf bifurcation. As Gr further increases; this complex coalescence splits intotwo real eigenvalues again. The oscillatory flow consists of counter-rotating vortices …,Physics of fluids,2010,6

Undermethanogenic conditions; a sludge from a full-scale UASB treating TFT-LCD wastewaterwas able to degrade 2;000 mg/L of TMAH within 10 h and attained a specific degradationrate of 19.2 mgTMAH/gVSS-h. Furthermore; several chemicals including some surfactants;DMSO; and sulfate were examined for their potential inhibitory effects on TMAHbiodegradation under methanogenic conditions. The results indicated that surfactant S1 (upto 2%) and DMSO (up to 1;000 mg/L) presented negligible inhibitory effects on TMAHdegradation; while surfactant S2 (0.2–1%) might inhibit methanogenic reaction without anyTMAH degradation for 3–5 h. At sulfate concentrations higher than 300 mg/L; a completeinhibition of methanogenic reaction and TMAH biodegradation was observed. Results …,Water Science and Technology,2010,6

Mining plans for customer-class transformation,Qiang Yang; Hong Cheng,We consider the problem of mining high-utility plans from historical plan databases that canbe used to transform customers from one class to other; more desirable classes. Traditionaldata mining algorithms are focused on finding frequent sequences. But high frequency maynot imply low costs and high benefits. Traditional Markov decision process (MDP) algorithmsare designed to address this issue by bringing in the concept of utility; but these algorithmsare also known to be expensive to execute. We present a novel algorithm AUPlan; whichautomatically generates sequential plans with high utility by combining data mining and AIplanning. These high-utility plans could be used to convert groups of customers from lessdesirable states to more desirable ones.

In neutral Tris-HCl buffer; Cu (Ⅱ) Im-4 can bind to DNA with the bindingconstant of 2. 7× 10~ 2 L/mol. Obviously; this is a weak interaction. However; it is anintercalative model which has been identified by the experiments of fluorescence andelectrochemistry. A novel method for the cleavage of DNA by the electrochemically-inducedprocess of the reduction of Cu (Ⅱ) Im4 is established and differential scanning calorimetries(DSC) are used to detect the results of DNA cleavage.,Chemical Journal of Chinese Universities,2003,6

Impression creep of a viscous layer,Hong Chen; JCM Li,Abstract Impression creep of a flat-ended cylindrical punch pushed into a viscous layeroverlaid on a rigid substrate is analyzed. The method developed here permits us to relatethe impression velocity to the punching stress in terms of an auxiliary function; whichrepresents the solution of a set of Fredholm integral equations with a continuoussymmetrical kernel. By a series of numerical analysis; the influence of the boundaryconditions and the effect of the thickness of the layer on the impression velocity areobtained. For infinite thickness (ie; h/a→∞; where h is the thickness of the layer and a is theradius of the punch); the impression creep is independent of the stick or slip boundarycondition at the indenter/layer interface. For finite thickness such as h/a= 20; the boundaryconditions have about 5% effect on the impression velocity. For a thin film; the impressing …,Journal of Materials Research,2001,6

Experimental determination of the effect of polarization of the heating laser pulse on the characteristic decay time constant and focal length of thermal lenses; and on...,HM Chen; ZA Schelly,Abstract The characteristic decay time constant of defocusing thermal lenses wasdetermined in pure benzene; water; chloroform and nitrobenzene; with the use of non-polarized single heating pulses of a Nd: YAG laser. From the characteristic time constants;the thermal diffusivities were calculated and compared with those obtained through theknown values of thermal constants of the homogeneous liquids. From the course of decay ofthe thermal lenses; their focal lengths at the beginning of the decay process weredetermined. Generally; the characteristic decay time constants were found to be smaller; thefocal lengths longer; and the thermal diffusivities greater with polarized than with non-polarized heating pulses. The difference is interpreted in terms of the unidirectionalalignment of induced dipoles by the linearly polarized heating pulse.,Chemical physics letters,1994,6

Effect of moxibustion on the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity in peripheral blood of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis,GS Hu; HP Chen; YJ Hou,Abstract To investigate the immune regulating effect of moxibustion on the patients withHashimoto's thyroiditis; 35 patients were treated by moxibustion and the changes ofantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in the peripheral blood of thepatients and their relationship with thyroid microsomal antibody (MCA) before and aftertreatment were observed. It was found that the activity of ADCC and the combining rate ofMCA were higher than normal and they were closely related to each other. After treatment;both of them declined remarkably and the relationship between them remained the same.The result indicated that the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis by moxibustion might wellbe related to its effect of decreasing the activity of ADCC and the titer of anti-thyroidantibodies.,Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi= Chinese journal of modern developments in traditional medicine,1991,6

Effects of prior compression on ductility and yielding behaviour in extruded magnesium alloy AZ31,JJ He; TM Liu; HB Chen; LW Lu; FS Pan,Abstract In the present paper; the effects of precompression along extrusion direction (ED)on subsequent compression perpendicular to ED were investigated in an extrudedmagnesium alloy AZ31. The results showed that the yield stress under compressionperpendicular to ED increased if there was precompression along ED. The evolution ofdeformation mechanism was responsible for increase in yield stress because plasticdeformation was dominated by both basal slip and {10–12} twinning under compressionperpendicular to ED in samples without prestrain; but basal slip was difficult to be activatedand {10–12} twinning dominated deformation in samples with precompression. However;because basal slip had no obvious contribution to plastic deformation; the ductilitydecreased if there was precompression along ED.,Materials Science and Technology,2014,5

Studies haveshown that BLS resistance in rice is quantitatively inherited; controlled by multiplequantitative trait loci (QTLs). A QTL with relatively large effect; qBlsr5a; was previouslymapped in a region of∼ 380 kb on chromosome 5. To fine map qBlsr5a further; a set ofoverlapping sub-chromosome segment substitution lines (sub-CSSLs) were developed froma large secondary F2 population (containing more than 7000 plants); in which only thechromosomal region harboring qBlsr5a was segregated. By genotyping the sub-CSSLs withmolecular markers covering the target region and phenotyping the sub-CSSLs with artificialinoculation; qBlsr5a was delimited to a 30.0-kb interval; in which only three genes werepredicted. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the three putative genes did not show …,PloS one,2014,5
A network-based; integrative approach to identify genes with aberrant co-methylation in colorectal cancer,Yongsheng Li; Juan Xu; Huanyu Ju; Yun Xiao; Hong Chen; Junying Lv; Tingting Shao; Jing Bai; Yunpeng Zhang; Li Wang; Xishan Wang; Huan Ren; Xia Li,Epigenetic changes; including aberrations in DNA methylation; are a common hallmark ofmany cancers. The identification and interpretation of epigenetic changes associated withcancers may benefit from integration with protein interactomes. Based on the assumptionthat genes implicated in a specific tumor phenotype will show high aberrant co-methylationpatterns with their interacting partners; we propose an integrated approach to uncovercancer-associated genes by integrating a DNA methylome with an interactome. Aberrant co-methylated interactions were first identified in the specific cancer; and genes were thenprioritized based on their enrichment in aberrant co-methylation. By applying this to a large-scale colorectal cancer (CRC) dataset; the proposed method increases the power to captureknown genes. More importantly; genes possessing high aberrant co-methylation patterns …,Molecular BioSystems,2014,5

A framework of algorithms: Computing the bias and prestige of nodes in trust networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,A trust network is a social network in which edges represent the trust relationship betweentwo nodes in the network. In a trust network; a fundamental question is how to assess andcompute the bias and prestige of the nodes; where the bias of a node measures thetrustworthiness of a node and the prestige of a node measures the importance of the node.The larger bias of a node implies the lower trustworthiness of the node; and the largerprestige of a node implies the higher importance of the node. In this paper; we define avector-valued contractive function to characterize the bias vector which results in a richfamily of bias measurements; and we propose a framework of algorithms for computing thebias and prestige of nodes in trust networks. Based on our framework; we develop fouralgorithms that can calculate the bias and prestige of nodes effectively and robustly. The …,PloS one,2012,5
Event-related brain potentials that distinguish false memory for events that occurred only seconds in the past,Hong Chen; Joel L Voss; Chunyan Guo,False memory often involves retrieving events from the distant past that did not actuallyhappen. However; recent evidence obtained using the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM)paradigm for eliciting false memory experiences suggests that individuals can falselybelieve that events occurred mere seconds in the past when they in fact did not. Subjects inthese experiments endorsed unstudied critical lure words as having been studied; despitethe fact that word lists were studied just moments before. We identified event-related brainpotential (ERP) correlates of this experience; and included a repetition priming manipulationto better assess the functional significance of these ERPs. Behavioral and ERP data werecollected from 21 Capital Normal University students using a short-term DRM task. Twocategories of effects were identified that distinguished true from false short-term memory …,Behavioral and Brain Functions,2012,5

The antenna was fabricated on an FR-4 epoxy substrate andhas a volume of 40.0× 32.0× 1.0 mm 3. The simulated and measured results show that theantenna has nearly omnidirectional patterns; stable gain; and an available impedancebandwidth of 9.38 GHz which covers 2.34–11.72 GHz. By etching two slots in the radiator;band-notched features centered at 3.5 and 5.5 GHz are achieved. With adding twomicroelectromechanical system switches across slots; the band-rejected characteristics canbe reconfigurable and the proposed antenna is capable of operating among none or singleor dual band-notched modes. Meanwhile; to discuss the mechanisms of the band-rejectedproperties; the conceptual equivalent circuit models are presented.© 2012 Wiley …,Microwave and Optical Technology Letters,2012,5

Suppression of the photoinduced light scattering in LiNbO3: Fe by redox treatment and incoherent homogeneous illumination,Wenbo Yan; Xunan Shen; Lihong Shi; Fangfang Jia; Huibin Qiao; Hongjian Chen; Guifeng Chen; Yingjie Lu; Shaofei Zhang; Aidiao Lin,Abstract In this paper; the redox treatment and incoherent homogeneous illumination weretried for the suppression of the photoinduced light scattering in LiNbO 3: Fe. Meanwhile; theeffects of both the redox treatment and incoherent homogeneous illumination on theholographic storage properties of LiNbO 3: Fe were also studied. Our experimental datashow that the reduction treatment sacrifices the diffraction efficiency for the suppression ofphotoinduced light scattering in LiNbO 3: Fe. By contrast; incoherent homogeneousillumination with the wavelength of 460 nm is efficient to suppress the photoinduced lightscattering without any tradeoff on the holographic storage performance of LiNbO 3: Fe. Thesuperiority of homogeneous illumination over the reduction treatment was attributed to theuntouched acceptor concentration under the homogeneous illumination.,Applied Physics A,2012,5

PSO-based self-tuning PI control for STATCOM,Hongjun Chen; Jing Li; Xin Zhou,In order to regulate the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage of power electronics systemunder different disturbance conditions; a self-tuning PI controller using particle swarmoptimization (PSO) algorithm is designed to control a static synchronous compensator(STATCOM). The mathematical model of STATCOM is firstly deduced in order to design aneffective controller. Then; a self-tuning PI controller is designed as a PCC voltage regulator.A PSO algorithm considering the best particle gains; the best global gains; and previouschange of gains is applied to achieve the desired PI controller gains when the load isvarying. The system responses of the PSO self-tuning controller are compared with thosefrom the fixed-gain PI controller. The simulation results for a system with different loads verifythe effectiveness of the PSO self-tuning controller for a STATCOM.,Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (IPEMC); 2012 7th International,2012,5
Probabilistic neural network for rss-based collaborative localization,Peisen Zhao; Chunxiao Jiang; Hongyang Chen; Yong Ren,One critical challenge for accurate localization with Received Signal Strength Indicator(RSSI) is the anisotropic environment; which causes the RSS-Distance Relationship (RDR)to vary spatially. To alleviate localization error caused by RDR anisotropy; most of existingworks adopt multiple RDR algorithms. However; we have found that the arbitrary RDRselection in these algorithms can lead to large localization error. Moreover; localizationaccuracy can be further enhanced by utilizing information provided by more Access Points(APs). To address these problems; we propose a Probabilistic Neural Network basedlocalization algorithm in this paper. The algorithm features two steps: Global Optimizationand Regional Compensation; during which all APs exchange information about the BlindNode (BN) to locate it collaboratively. Simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm …,Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring); 2012 IEEE 75th,2012,5

Study of passivation at the positive active material/grid interface in lead–acid batteries,HY Chen; WS Li; YB Zhu; LP Tian,Abstract A valuable additive—boric acid—to eliminate passivation of the active material/gridinterface in positive plates of lead–acid batteries has been selected through comparison ofsingle-cell discharge tests. This overcomes the problem of rapid decline in initialperformance when using low-antimony (1.7 wt.%) grid alloys. The performance of the oxidefilm on positive grids; as well as its composition and amount; is determined through cathodicreduction of the film with a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) method. The results confirm thatpassivation of the positive grid and rapid decline in the initial discharge voltage are due to aresistive layer of PbSO 4; and not PbO n (1≤ n≤ 2). The PbO n layer has little effect onpassivation. The findings of this study are useful for the production of lead–acid batteries.,Journal of power sources,2000,5

Current response of cytochrome C promoted by dodecyl benzene sodium sulfonate,Genaxi Li; Hairong Shi; Huiqun Fang; Hongyuan Chen; Dexu Zhu,ABSTRACT Previously purified cytochrome c can exhibit a current response at a silverelectrode and the electron transfer reaction can be promoted by dodecyl benzene sodiumsulfonate. Addition of the promoter to the protein solution; the peak potentials of the proteinare unchanged; but the peak currents increase sharply. Experimental results reveal that thepeak current is linearly proportional to the protein concentration in the range of 0.08–1.2μmol/L. The detection limit is 0.05 μmol/L. In addition; commercial samples as received canalso give good redox waves after the macromolecules are acted on by the promoter. So thecurrent response of the protein can be widely used.,Analytical letters,1997,5

Regulation on ACTH; beta-EP and immune function by moxibustion on different acupoints,D Zhai; B Din; R Liu; X Hua; H Chen,Abstract The experimental results displayed that the cellular immune functions of tumor-bearing mice in control group were significantly lower than that the normal control group.The cellular immune functions of those groups accepting moxibustion treatment weremaintained at a relatively higher level. Among them the Guanyuan group seemed to be bestin immune regulation. The data further demonstrated that an instant elevation of serumACTH and beta-EP could be caused by moxibustion. But the bariations of serum ACTH andbeta-EP are not paralleled. A remarkable increase of serum beta-EP was seen in Guanyuangroup but not of serum ACTH. The experimental results hinted that the regulation of beta-EPand ACTH was related to the immune regulation induced by moxibustion.,Zhen ci yan jiu= Acupuncture research,1996,5

Dynamics of laser-induced transient light scattering in pure liquids and reverse micelles,HM Chen; ZA Schelly,Abstract Transient turbidity is induced in benzene; chloroform; water; nitrobenzene; andaerosol-OT/CCl 4 reverse micelles (but not in neat CCl 4) by single linearly polarized or non-polarized pulses of a Nd: YAG laser operated in the fixed-Q; TEM 00 mode. No turbidity isobserved in any of the systems if short; Q-switched pulses are used. Above a certainthreshold value necessary to induce the effect; the amplitude of turbidity is linearlyproportional to the power of the laser pulse; and the amplitude is greater with non-polarizedpulses. Both the rise and fall times of the turbidity signal depend on the state of polarizationof the inducing pulse. In pure liquids; the rise times are shorter with polarized pulses thanwith non-polarized pulses; whereas the fall times show the opposite dependence. In reversemicellar solution; both the rise and fall of the turbidity are faster with polarized pulses than …,Chemical physics letters,1994,5

Dependence of the dynamics of the transient thermal lens effect on the polarization of the heating laser pulse,HM Chen; ZA Schelly,Abstract The rates of build-up and relaxation of the transient thermal defocusing lens effectinduced by single pulses of a Nd: YAG laser operated in the fixed-Q TEM 00 mode wereinvestigated in pure benzene; water; chloroform and nitrobenzene at an ambienttemperature of 23.5° C. Only a negligibly small lens effect was observed in carbontetrachloride. If a linearly polarized heating pulse is used; both the rise and the relaxation ofthe effect are faster; although the magnitude is smaller; than obtained with non-polarizedpulses of the same energy and pulse shape. The difference is caused by the alignment ofinduced dipoles by the linearly polarized pulse.,Chemical physics letters,1988,5

Full-car active suspension based on H2/generalised H2 output feedback control,Shuyou Yu; Fei Wang; Jing Wang; Hong Chen,This paper establishes a 15 degree-of-freedom (DOF) full-car simulation model for the carHongqi HQ3. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated by comparison of the real data ofHQ3 with the data of the model. Output feedback control of the active suspension isdesigned based on a half-car model. High quality ride comfort is achieved by minimising theH2 norm from disturbances on the road to the vertical acceleration and the pitch accelerationof the car; while safety constraints such as suspension dynamic travels; static/dynamic loadratios and normalised load flows are guaranteed by the generalised H2 norm. The 15 DOFfull-car model; together with the left and the right output feedback controllers; form a closed-loop system. The simulation result of the full-car shows that the active suspension cangreatly reduce the vertical acceleration; pitch acceleration and roll acceleration as well as …,International Journal of Vehicle Design,2015,4

Design of a miniaturized dual-band bandpass filter with high selectivity,Xiao Lei Ma; Yong Lun Luo; Shuang Lin Yuan; Long Chen,Abstract—In this paper; a miniaturized dual-band bandpass filter with high selectivity andband-toband isolation is presented. The filter consists of two quarter-wavelength steppedimpedance resonators (SIRs) which share a common grounded via-hole and twosymmetrical half-wavelength SIRs which are embedded into the inner space to reduce thesize of the filter. Two independent mixed coupling paths which are created by the couplingbetween these SIRs introduce two different passbands. Five transmission zeros (TZs) aregenerated near the two passbands to achieve high frequency selectivity and band-to-bandisolation. To validate the design theory; a dual-band filter operating at 2.45 and 5.2 GHz wasdesigned and fabricated. The size of the proposed filter only occupies 0. 095λg× 0. 109λgand the measured 3dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of the first and second passbands is …,Progress In Electromagnetics Research,2014,4

The molar volume [3] of H2 is 65.8 cm3 molÀ1 at300 K and 500 bar; and 41.0 cm3 molÀ1 at 1000 bar. Both values are much higher than thevalue of 28.2 cm3 molÀ1 for liquid H2 at 1 bar. Thus; the reduction of the molar volume byincreasing the pressure offers little storage efficiency; while it raises significant costs andsafety issues.[4] Such a situation is made more unfortunate by the known fact that H2 ishighly compressible.[5; 6] For gases such as CH4 and CO; little compression could beachieved once the intermolecular distance enters the repulsive regime. But for H2;substantial compression is still possible because with only two electrons in a relatively …,Angewandte Chemie,2013,4

Thermal processing technology optimization of 1 Cr 13 ring forgings,XG Qian; Yao Huang; LG Wang; Hong Chen; Yu Fan,1Cr13 steel is easy to be cracked in thermal processing. According to the steel alloy phasediagram; a heating specification and the range of forging temperature from 900 to 1180℃were designed. Using the finite element modeling; the influences of pre-upsetting+ twistingpressure upsetting process on forging drum; strain-effective and stress-effective wereanalyzed and compared. The results show that the relative diameter ratio K of pre-upsetting+twist pressure upsetting is 0.71; which is smaller than that of the ordinary. Two fire rollingprocess was proposed to solve the large rolling deformation resistance and inhomogeneousorganization of 1Cr13 ring forgings. The production practice shows that the thermalprocessing after optimization can reduce forging crack; refine grains; increase forgings sizeprecision; so as to improve the qualified rate of the product.,Duanya Jishu- Forging & Stamping Technology,2012,4
Tuning the surface plasmon on Ag (111) by organic molecules,Baojie Feng; Huajun Qin; Jiehui He; Xiaoyue He; Peng Cheng; Lan Chen; Kehui Wu,The surface plasmon dispersion of Ag (111) tuned by adsorption of F4-TCNQ molecules hasbeen investigated using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. For the pristineAg (111) film; the surface plasmon energy shows a positive quadratic dispersion. Afteradsorption of F4-TCNQ; the plasmon energy of Ag decreases significantly and thedispersion switches sign at small q||. The deviation systematically increases with thecoverage of F4-TCNQ. These behaviors are explained by charge transfer between the Agsubstrate and the molecular gas layer.,Journal of Applied Physics,2012,4

Zero reflection and field enhancement by subwavelength nonconjugated single negative metamaterial pair,YQ Ding; YH Li; HT Jiang; H Chen,Abstract In this paper; zero reflection and field enhancement realized by subwavelengthnonconjugated mu-negative and epsilon-negative metamaterial pair (NMEMP) areinvestigated. It is found although the impedance contrasts greatly at the interface; zeroreflection can still be achieved by introducing subwavelength NMEMP. Moreover; theelectromagnetic field distributions show that; only one component of the zero reflectionmode (either electric or magnetic field) will be enhanced; with the other one suppressedsimultaneously. Therefore; NMEMP is promising to be applied in modern optic andmicrowave communication systems for less reflection; flexible control of electromagneticfield and compact device volume.,Optics Communications,2011,4

Light scattering induced by opposite microdomains in LiNbO 3: Fe: Hf crystals,Wenbo Yan; Lihong Shi; Hongjian Chen; Xunan Shen; Yongfa Kong,We report on the light scattering phenomenon in annealed multidomain LiNbO_3: Fe: Hfcrystals. The scattering sources are found to be some fog-like “defects”; which cause thepolarization-dependent scattering of the light; and can be removed completely by theillumination of visible light. Based on these results and the etch patterns; these “defects” aresuggested to be refractive index fluctuations induced by the space charges accumulated atthe boundary of opposite microdomains. The influence of quick heating-up on the “defects”is also studied and the results firmly support our suggestion about the nature of the “defects”.At last; the temporal curves of the transmitted intensity during the light scattering areexplained. The mechanism for the opposite microdomain formation is also explained fromthe view of crystal growth.,Optics Express,2010,4

Rescattering effects of baryon and antibaryon in heavy quarkonium decays,Hong Chen; Rong-Gang Ping,Abstract Rescattering effects of baryon and antibaryon in heavy quarkonium decays areinvestigated by studying their angular distributions. The rescattering amplitudes arephenomenologically evaluated by modeling the intermediate range interaction as a σ orpion meson exchange between qq¯ quarks. The results show that the rescattering effectsplay an important role in determination of the angular distribution in heavy quarkoniumdecays. Especially; for J/ψ and ψ (2 S) decays into Λ Λ¯; Σ 0 Σ¯ 0 and Ξ− Ξ¯+ the angulardistribution parameters could turn to be negative values in the limit of helicity conservation.These results provide us a possible explanation for understanding the negative sign of theangular distribution parameter measured for J/ψ→ Σ 0 Σ¯ 0; namely; it might come from thebaryonic SU (3) F symmetry breaking by incorporating rescattering effects.,Physics Letters B,2007,4

Crossover-type adsorption isotherms in natural waters; soils; sediments and aerosols: Re-assessment of phosphorus flux river-ocean interactions.,G Pan; H Zou; MD Krom; B Herut; YY Liu; H Chen; CX Jia; YH Yang; GH Chang,英文摘要: The selective catalytic reduction of NOx with C3H6 (C3H6-SCR of NOx) wascarried out in the presence of water vapor over various trace noble metal (Pt; Au and Pd) co-impregnated with Ag/Al2O3 catalysts. The Ag-Pd (0.01%)/Al2O3 shows a higher NOx;conversion than Ag/Al2O3 does; especially at temperatures ranging from 300 to500degreesC. However; the additions of An and Pt to Ag/Al2O3 only resulted in a decreaseof activity for the C3H6-SCR of NOx. In situ DRIFTS spectra suggests that the presence oftrace Pd (0.01%) catalyzed the formation of an enolic species which was converted fromC3H6; whereas the presence of Pt and Au did not show this effect. The surface enolicspecies is very active towards NO2 and NO3-; resulting in the formation of an NCO specieswhich is the key reaction intermediate in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx (C) 2004 …,*,2004,4

This is revealed by Patterson analysis ofsynchrotron x-ray-diffraction measurements of numerous in-plane fractional-order diffractionspots. The result suggests a mild interaction between the room-temperature-deposited filmand the substrate surface reconstruction. The C 60 film shows a (111) growth direction; andits [112] azimuth is oriented parallel to the {062} directions of the substrate. The result is adomain structure consistent with the threefold symmetry of the (111) growth direction and thetwo-domain; twofold symmetry of the substrate surface.,Physical Review B,1998,4

Redox reaction of myoglobin at a benzimidazole‐modified silver electrode,Genxi Li; Huiqun Fang; Yiqun Qian; Hongyuan Chen,Abstract Benzimidazole could be attached to a silver electrode by a covalent bondingmethod to give a high stable chemically modified electrode. Not only was the modifiedelectrode electroactive; myoglobin could also undergo redox reactions at the surface of theelectrode. In 0.20 mol/L NaAc-HAc buffer (pH 5.5); the benzimidazole modified electrodegave a pair of redox waves with a cathodic peak potential E pc of 0.10 V and an anodic peakpotential E pa of 0.25 V. On addition of myoglobin to the buffer; the peaks all increased dueto the redox processes of the protein. In addition; comparison studies of the purified proteinwith the commercial sample revealed that myoglobin could still give electrode responseeven though it had not been previously purified. Therefore; benzimidazole modified silverelectrode might be very attractive for the electrochemical studies of myoglobin.,Electroanalysis,1996,4

A system approach to determining the feasibility of forced molting commercial layers,LH Chen; JL McNAUGHTON; GW Malone,Abstract The economical and practical considerations in determining the feasibility ofmolting a commercial layer flock are based on several production and economical factors.This paper describes a computerized model used to predict: 1) the economic feasibility ofmolting when layers are in various production periods; 2) the net profit resulting fromdifferent molting procedures; and 3) the effect of increased feed cost on net profit. On thebasis of the application example and parameters in this study; forced laying hen moltresulted in higher net profit for two different molt regimens than for the no-molt alternative.However; based on the fixed inputs; the molt procedure employed resulted in different netrevenues. The situation and assumed conditions evaluated represented several alternativesto commercial producers. The model is designed to generally evaluate the feasibility of …,Poultry Science,1982,4
The relationship between the effects of cytokinin on the expansion and metabolism of excised cucumber cotyledons and water stress.,Zhe Tong; H-P Lian; Y-R Song; G-Q Tao; H-Y Chen; Cheng Tsui,Abstract: Excised cotyledons of the cucumber cv. Jin-ian No. 4 incubated with BA (10 ppm)or water for 1 h were rinsed and grown in darkness with or without different concentrations ofmannitol solution (MS). Although MS reduced the effects of BA; the increases in fresh weight;carotenoid; RNA and DNA contents and decrease in lipids were always higher in BA-treatedthan in water-treated tissues. BA alone enhanced the rate of water uptake whereas MS at0.3 M and 0.5 M almost prevented water uptake in the water-and BA-treated cotyledons;respectively. In these conditions the content of carotenoids and nucleic acids continued toincrease and that of lipids to decrease. BA stimulated simultaneously the water uptake andmetabolism in the cotyledons and its effect was similar under different osmotic potentials.,Acta Botanica Sinica,1980,4
TailCutter: Wisely cutting tail latency in cloud CDN under cost constraints,Zeqi Lai; Yong Cui; Minming Li; Zhenhua Li; Ningwei Dai; Yuchi Chen,Cloud computing platforms enable applications to offer low latency access to user data byoffering storage services in several geographically distributed data centers. In this paper; weidentify the high tail latency problem in cloud CDN via analyzing a large-scale datasetcollected from 783;944 users in a major cloud CDN. We find that the data downloadinglatency in cloud CDN is highly variable; which may significantly degrade the userexperience of applications. To address the problem; we present TailCutter; a workloadscheduling mechanism that aims at optimizing the tail latency while meeting the costconstraint given by application providers. We further design the Maximum Tail MinimizationAlgorithm (MTMA) working in TailCutter mechanism to optimally solve the Tail LatencyMinimization (TLM) problem in polynomial time.

Superionic adjustment leading to weakly temperature-dependent ZT values in bulk thermoelectrics,Hong Chen; Hua Lin; Zi-Xiong Lin; Jin-Ni Shen; Ling Chen; Li-Ming Wu,Thermoelectric (TE) materials are of worldwide interest for energy sustainability throughdirect waste-heat-to-electricity conversion. Practically; a TE power generator requires a largeworking temperature gradient; to achieve high efficiency; key TE materials with high ZTvalues are necessary and; furthermore; their ZT values should decline as little as possibleover the imposed temperature range. Unfortunately; sharp ZT declines in all of the knownmaterials are inevitable. Here we found the bulk superionic α-Ag1–x CuSe material exhibitsunusual weakly temperature-dependent ZT values in the range of 480–693 K with thesmallest ZT–T slope known to date. These result from the Seebeck coefficient balance of thecountercontributions of holes and electrons and the weakly temperature-dependent thermalconductivity.,Inorganic chemistry,2014,3
Structured low-rank matrix factorization with missing and grossly corrupted observations,Fanhua Shang; Yuanyuan Liu; Hanghang Tong; James Cheng; Hong Cheng,Abstract: Recovering low-rank and sparse matrices from incomplete or corruptedobservations is an important problem in machine learning; statistics; bioinformatics;computer vision; as well as signal and image processing. In theory; this problem can besolved by the natural convex joint/mixed relaxations (ie; l_ {1}-norm and trace norm) undercertain conditions. However; all current provable algorithms suffer from superlinear per-iteration cost; which severely limits their applicability to large-scale problems. In this paper;we propose a scalable; provable structured low-rank matrix factorization method to recoverlow-rank and sparse matrices from missing and grossly corrupted data; ie; robust matrixcompletion (RMC) problems; or incomplete and grossly corrupted measurements; ie;compressive principal component pursuit (CPCP) problems.

On concise set of relative candidate keys,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Hong Cheng,Abstract Matching keys; specifying what attributes to compare and how to compare them foridentifying the same real-world entities; are found to be useful in applications like recordmatching; blocking and windowing [7]. Owing to the complex redundant semantics amongmatching keys; capturing a proper set of matching keys is highly non-trivial. Analogous tominimal/candidate keys wrt functional dependencies; relative candidate keys (RCKs [7]; witha minimal number of compared attributes; see a more formal definition in Section 2) canclear up redundant semantics wrt" what attributes to compare". However; we note thatredundancy issues may still exist among rcks on the same attributes about" how to comparethem". In this paper; we propose to find a concise set of matching keys; which has lessredundancy and can still meet the requirements on coverage and validity.

Implementation of hybrid control for Bi-directional DC-DC converter,Hongjun Chen; Kai Fu; Hao Xu; Kai Ding,The bi-directional DC-DC converter is a typical hybrid power energy storage system; thispaper presents a hybrid control approach for the bi-directional DC-DC converter to achievea good control performance. The operation mode of the converter is divided into Buck modeand Boost mode according to the direction of energy flow. Considering the hybrid propertiesof bi-directional DC-DC converter; the hybrid automatons are obtained based on hybridautomaton theory. Then the process of control algorithm design is equivalent to the guard-selection problem of hybrid automaton. Based on the circuit theory; the guard conditions areselected. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid control algorithm has ahigh degree of robustness; a low amount of computations as well as a global stability.,Cyber Technology in Automation; Control; and Intelligent Systems (CYBER); 2014 IEEE 4th Annual International Conference on,2014,3
Effects of gas periodic stimulation on key enzyme activity in gas double-dynamic solid state fermentation (GDD-SSF),Hongzhang Chen; Meixue Shao; Hongqiang Li,Abstract The heat and mass transfer have been proved to be the important factors in airpressure pulsation for cellulase production. However; as process of enzyme secretion; thecellulase formation has not been studied in the view of microorganism metabolism andmetabolic key enzyme activity under air pressure pulsation condition. Two fermentationmethods in ATPase activity; cellulase productivity; weight lose rate and membranepermeability were systematically compared. Results indicated that gas double-dynamic solidstate fermentation had no obviously effect on cell membrane permeability. However; therelation between ATPase activity and weight loss rate was linearly dependent with r=0.9784. Meanwhile; the results also implied that gas periodic stimulation had apparentlystrengthened microbial metabolism through increasing ATPase activity during gas double …,Enzyme and microbial technology,2014,3

Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is an important aquacultureflatfish in China. Cytogenetic analysis has revealed that its sex determination system isfemale heterogametic (ZZ/ZW). The W chromosome is morphologically larger and has beenconsidered evolutionarily younger than any other chromosome in the set. However; thegenetic origin and evolution process of this neo-chromosome remains unclear. In this study;2 tandem arrays of rRNA genes were chosen to address this question. Both the major rDNA(18S rDNA) and the minor rDNA (5S rDNA) were located on the C. semilaevis chromosomesby fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Six 18S rDNA signals were observed on thecentromeric regions of 3 pairs of autosomes in both males and females.

Distributed Bayesian compressive sensing based blind carrier-frequency offset estimation for interleaved OFDMA uplink,Peng Cheng; Zhuo Chen; Y Jay Guo; Lin Gui,Carrier-frequency offset (CFO) estimation for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexingaccess (OFDMA) systems operating in multiuser uplink transmission is very challenging dueto the presence of a multiple-parameter estimation problem. In this paper; we propose anovel blind CFO estimation method for interleaved OFDMA uplink based on distributedBayesian compressive sensing (DBCS) theory. Considering the received signal structure;the new method first constructs a measurement matrix associated with a sparse signal matrixweight; which sets up the stage for the application of CS theory in tackling the originalestimation problem. Then; the DBCS theory that exploits a common sparse profile of thesparse signal matrix weight is employed to distributively estimate a sparse hyperparametervector; whose significant peaks are linked to the correct estimation of the multiple CFOs …,Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC); 2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on,2013,3
Mathematical modeling and performance analysis of battery equalization systems,Haoqi Chen; Liang Zhang; Yehui Han,Battery equalizers are widely used in multi-battery systems to maintain balanced chargeamong individual battery cells. While research on the hardware realization of batteryequalizers has received significant attention; rigorous analysis of battery equalizationprocess from the system's point of view remains largely unexplored. In this paper; we studytwo types of battery equalization system structures: series connection-based and module-based. Specifically; we develop mathematical models that describe the system-levelbehavior of the battery equalization processes under these equalization structures. Then;based on the mathematical models; analytical methods are derived to evaluate theperformance of the equalization processes. In addition; we carry out statistical analysis tocompare the performance of the two equalization structures considered.,Automation Science and Engineering (CASE); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,3

Energetics of nonlinear internal waves generated by tidal flow over topography,Zhi-Wu Chen; Jieshuo Xie; Jiexin Xu; Jie-Min Zhan; Shuqun Cai,Abstract An in-house fully nonlinear; nonhydrostatic numerical model is utilized forsimulations of internal solitary waves (ISWs) generated by tidal flows over a Gaussian silltopography. A complete; rigorous theoretical framework is then adopted for the energeticsanalysis of these ISWs. The ratio of topographic amplitude to the total water depth is fixed;and the tidal excursion parameter (ε) and slope parameter (γ) are varied by changing theimposed barotropic velocity and the horizontal scale of the topography. It is found that theenergy input; conversion; and radiation rates all increase monotonically with ε. They peakwhen the bottom topography is critical (γ= 1). The energy input is generated by the pressuredifference across the domain. The energy conversion rate in percentage (normalized by thecorresponding input rate) decreases almost linearly as ε increases. The larger the slope …,Ocean Modelling,2013,3
Flaw tolerance in a viscoelastic strip,Lei Chen; Shaohua Chen; Huajian Gao,Load-bearing biological materials such as bone; teeth; and nacre have acquired someinteresting mechanical properties through evolution; one of which is the tolerance ofcracklike flaws incurred during tissue function; growth; repair; and remodeling. Whilenumerous studies in the literature have addressed flaw tolerance in elastic structures; so farthere has been little investigation of this issue in time-dependent; viscoelastic systems; inspite of its importance to biological materials. In this paper; we investigate flaw tolerance in aviscoelastic strip under tension and derive the conditions under which a pre-existing centercrack; irrespective of its size; will not grow before the material fails under uniform rupture.The analysis is based on the Griffith and cohesive zone models of crack growth in aviscoelastic material; taking into account the effects of the loading rate along with the …,Journal of Applied Mechanics,2013,3
Computing weight constraint reachability in large networks,Miao Qiao; Hong Cheng; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; S Yu Philip; Lijun Chang,Abstract Reachability is a fundamental problem on large-scale networks emergingnowadays in various application domains; such as social networks; communicationnetworks; biological networks; road networks; etc. It has been studied extensively. However;little existing work has studied reachability with realistic constraints imposed on graphs withreal-valued edge or node weights. In fact; such weights are very common in many real-worldnetworks; for example; the bandwidth of a link in communication networks; the reliability ofan interaction between two proteins in PPI networks; and the handling capacity of awarehouse/storage point in a distribution network. In this paper; we formalize a new yetimportant reachability query in weighted undirected graphs; called weight constraintreachability (WCR) query that asks: is there a path between nodes a and b; on which …,The VLDB Journal,2013,3

Discussion about the determination methods of weighted centroid of dBZ on vector radar echoes,XT Yu; ZW Yu; XP Rui; F Li; YT Xi; HQ Chen,Abstract Accurate calculation of weighted centroid of dBZ (dBZ stands for decibels ofreflectivity of a radar signal reflected off a remote object.) is the basis of studyingcharacteristic tracking algorithms on the vector echoes. The authors mainly discussed thecalculation methods of weighted centroid of dBZ on vector echo data. Based on thecalculation method on raster echo data; some calculation methods of weighted centroid ofdBZ on vector echo data were proposed by considering the weights of features' area anddistance from their location to radar center. And then; taking the base reflectivity products ofCINRAD/SA weather radar in Meizhou city of China as data sources; the authorstransformed this type of echo data into the vector format. In the end; using the vector echomaps above; the weighted centroid of the same area was calculated by the methods …,Procedia Engineering,2012,3

Bug signature minimization and fusion,David Lo; Hong Cheng; Xiaoyin Wang,Debugging is a time-consuming activity. To help in debugging; many approaches have beenproposed to pinpoint the location of errors given labeled failures and correct executions.While such approaches have been shown to be accurate; at times the location alone is notsufficient in helping programmers understand why the bug happens and how to fix it.Furthermore; a single location might not be powerful enough to discriminate failures fromcorrect executions. To address the above challenges; there have been recent studies onextracting bug signatures which are composed of multiple locations appearing together in aparticular order signifying an occurrence of a bug. The latest study on bug signatures byCheng et al. models program executions as graphs. Two sets of graphs corresponding tofailures and correct executions are then contrasted to extract the most discriminative …,High-Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE); 2011 IEEE 13th International Symposium on,2011,3
Weld appearance and mechanical properties of aluminum-lithium alloy by YAG-MIG hybrid welding,Fei XU; Li CHEN; Jing YANG,The weld appearance and mechanical properties of 5A90 Al-Li alloy sheet by YAG-MIGhybrid welding are studied. The results show that the weld appearance (collapse; undercut;and so on) of 5A90 alloy by laser beam welding (LBW) is improved by YAG-MIG hybridwelding significantly. And the maximal tolerant gap of the hybrid welding could reach toabout 1.0 mm. The major microstructure characteristics of joint by hybrid welding are fine-grained layer and the equaixed grain in most of welded seam; which are similar to the jointby LBW. Compared with the latter; the microstructure of the former tends to coarse; and therange of the columnar crystals zone is prone to decrease. The microhardness of weldedseam by hybrid welding (83.57 HV0. 2) is lower than that by LBW (95.65 HV0. 2); but theuniformity of the former is better than that of the latter.

Optimization design of baffle plates in porthole die for aluminium profile extrusion,C Zhang; G Zhao; X Sun; H Chen; B Gao,During the hot extrusion; material flow uniformity plays an important role in the extrusionprocess and product quality. In practice; material flow could be balanced by many means; egby adjusting the layout and shapes of portholes; by designing various levels of weldingchamber; or by taking various bearing lengths. The purpose of this study was to optimizelayout and heights of baffle plates in the welding chamber in order to balance material flow.First; the extrusion process was simulated by means of HyperXtrude. Due to the largevelocity difference in the cross-section of the profile obtained from initial numericalsimulation; baffle plates would be adjusted. By several adjustments; an optimal die structurewith uniform material flow velocity in the cross-section of the extrudate was obtained and asound profile produced. Therefore; baffle plates could effectively balance material flow …,Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers; Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications,2011,3

Distributed transmit beamforming based on frequency scanning,Chen Wang; Qinye Yin; Bichan Shi; Hongyang Chen; Qiyue Zou,Distributed beamforming is a form of collaborative communication; in which wireless nodesadjust the phases of their transmitted signals so that the signals are combined coherently atthe destination. This enhances the received signal power and extends the communicationrange. In this paper; we propose a transmit beamforming method that does not require anyexplicit feedback information from the receiver for the phase adjustment. Instead; sensorsuse phase-locked loops (PLL) to synchronize their carriers to the received reference signalbroadcast by the destination/receiver. Based on the fact that the change of phase over somedistance depends not only on the distance but also on the frequency; the destinationindirectly adjusts the sensors' phase by changing the frequency of the reference signal. Thedestination scans all the frequencies within a feasible range to find the optimal frequency …,Communications (ICC); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,3

Investigations of the OH− absorption bands in congruent and near-stoichiometric LiNbO3: Hf crystals,Wenbo Yan; Lihong Shi; Hongjian Chen; Xunan Shen; Yongfa Kong,Abstract OH− absorption bands of both congruent and near-stoichiometric LiNbO 3: Hfcrystals were investigated. The abrupt blueshift of OH− absorption bands was foundbetween the doping levels of 2 and 2.5 mol% in the congruent crystals; which confirms theexact optical-damage threshold for Hf doping. The absorption difference of OH− bandsbetween the congruent and near-stoichiometric crystals shows that after Li incorporation H+ions no longer prefer the sites of 3500 cm− 1. Moreover; with the increase of Hf doping in thenear-stoichiometric crystals; H+ ions were found to gradually transfer to the sites of 3489cm− 1. These results are explained by the breakdown of the association of Hf Nb− and H+ions and the subsequent redistribution of H+ ions around Hf Li 3+ ions in V Li−-deficientlattice. Additionally; the link between the intrinsic defects and how they influence the …,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2010,3

Because of the different sampling rates of current (voltage) transformers inWAMS; it is necessary to convert them to the same rate. Sampling rate conversion in arational factor was realized through cascade connection of decimation; interpolation and low-pass filter. A digital constrictive band-pass filter algorithm based on full cycle Fourieralgorithm was proposed. It can be proved that the method is validity through the illustrativeexample. This algorithm can not only obtain the useful signal from filter fast and effectively;but also realize the normalized sampling rate of signals without distortion.,Electric Power,2010,3

Applications of Organic Silicone Coating Agent in Textiles [J],Hong CHEN; Gui-zeng BAO; Bao-hua GUO,The features and reaction mechanisms of organic silicone are reviewed. Polymethylsiloxanecan form a protective layer on a fabric surface after condensation crosslinking.Polymethylsiloxane consists of a polar inorganic part and non-polar organic part. Under hightemperature conditions and the presence of catalyst; the silicone main chains are polarized.This effect tends to make the polar part point toward the fiber surface and forms hydrogenbonds; coordination bonds and covalent bonds. Therefore; the combination force betweenpolysiloxane protection film and fabric fibers are enhanced. The non-polar part prefers topoint toward the outside as a result of the repulsion from the polar part and form a water andsolvent-insoluble single molecule layer on the fabric surface; which renders the fabrics waterrepellent.

Saddle node bifurcation point calculation of voltage stability based on adjoint system theory,Kaipeng Wang; Yiwei Zhang; Lei CHEN; Yong MIN,Saddle-node bifurcation point of power flow functions is important in voltage stabilityanalysis. A method based on the adjoint system theory is proposed. When load demandsexceed the limit; there exist extraneous solutions in adjoint power flow functions andLyapunov function value of extraneous solutions is nonzero. If appropriate Lyapunovfunction value is given; solutions near the bifurcation points can be obtained. A linearinterpolation function can approximate the extraneous solutions curve. Combined withMoore-Spence system; saddle-node bifurcation point can be calculated. The simulationresults of several standard IEEE test systems validate the proposed method.,Automation of Electric Power System,2009,3

On the Perfection of China's Tax Rules of Regulating Thin Capitalization [J],Yi-xin LIAO; Hong-yan CHEN,The Arm's length principle is not an effective method of regulating thin capitalization. In orderto enhance tax law's certainty and its efficiency of enforcement; China should make full useof the opportunity of integrating two enterprise income tax law systems to perfect the taxlegislation on thin capitalization. The new tax legislation should in principle adopt the FixedRatio Approach complemented by the Arm's length principle; and apply to domestic andtransnational transactions indiscriminately. When designing the tax rules regulating thincapitalization in the Fixed Ratio Approach; China should take her practical situations intoconsideration; making them as close as possible to the Arm's length principle on the onehand; and ensuring their flexibility on the other hand.,Journal of Xiamen University (Arts & Social Sciences),2007,3

Spin excitation in d-wave superconductors: a Fermi liquid picture,Khee-Kyun Voo; Hong-Yi Chen; Wen-Chin Wu,Abstract A detailed study of the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra of the high-T ccuprates based on the Fermi liquid (FL) picture is given. We focus on the issue of thetransformation between the commensurate and incommensurate (IC) excitation driven byfrequency or temperature. For La 2− x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO); the condition of small Δ (0)/v Fcan simultaneously reproduce the always existing IC peaks in the superconducting (SC) andnormal states; and the always fixed location at temperature or frequency change. For YBa 2Cu 3 O 6+ x (YBCO); a moderate Δ (0)/v F and proximity of the van Hove singularity (vHS) atM=(0; π) to the Fermi level can reproduce the frequency-and temperature-driven shifting ICpeaks in the SC state; and the vanishing of the IC peak in the normal state. We address theconditional peak shifting behavior to a refined consideration on the nesting effect which is …,Physica C: Superconductivity,2002,3
Electromagnetic scanning to estimate carcass lean content of Taiwan native broilers,RS Lin; LR Chen; SC Huang; CY Liu,Abstract To estimate lean content of Taiwan native broiler carcasses accurately; objectivelyand rapidly; electrical conductivity measurements of broiler carcasses and other relativefactors (carcass weight; length and temperature) were used in multiple linear regressionanalysis for lean prediction. Forty native broiler carcasses; with average market weight2477.5±465.5 g; were scanned through a 10 MHz electromagnetic field created by anelectromagnetic scanner (SA-3203) to measure the total body electrical conductivity(TOBEC) index. After scanning; each broiler carcass was separated into wing; breast; legand back. Each primal cut was dissected into lean; fat and bone. The weight; length;temperature and TOBEC index of broiler carcass were significantly correlated with leanweight of broiler carcass (P< 0.001).

Electrochemical behavior of myoglobin at a thiamazole modified silver electrode,Jun-Jie Zhu; Kai Gu; Guang-Chao Zhao; Hong-Yuan Chen,ABSTRACT Thiamazole is covalently attached onto the surface of a silver electrode to form achemically modified one; which is long-lived and stable. It shows the capability of selectivelycomplexing myoglobin and can be applied as a selective biosensor for this compound.Myoglobin is accumulated onto the CME at 0.32 V (vs. SCE). After exchanging the medium;it is determined by differential pulse stripping voltammetry. A cathodic stripping peak isobtained by scanning the potential from 0.32 V to 0.0 V. The peak currents are linearlyproportional to the concentrations of the protein in the range of 0.5∼ 5.0 mg/ml. The relativestandard deviation is 6.4% for 6 successive determinations of 3.0 mg/ml myoglobin.,*,1999,3

Captopril modified silver electrode and its application to the electroanalysis of hemoglobin,Junjie Zhu; Yue Gong; Genxi Li; Hongyuan Chen; Dexu Zhu,Abstract Captopril; 1-[(2S)-3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-oxopropyl]-L-Proline; can be depositedonto a silver electrode by a covalent bonding method to give a long-lived and stablechemically modified electrode (CME). Since the CME is prepared with a reaction betweencaptopril and the substrate silver; the CME being prepared by this method is very stable.Furthermore; Hemoglobin (Hb) exhibits excellent voltammetric response at the modifiedelectrode. Differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) measurements of the protein with this CMEreveal the existence of a linear relationship between the anodic peak current and theconcentration of Hb in the range of 2× 10− 6∼ 5× 10− 5 mol/L. The detection limit is 8× 10−7 mol/L and the relative standard deviation of results is 5% for 6 successive determinationsat 2× 10-5 mol/L.

Damage and fatigue life of superalloy IN738LC under thermo-mechanical and low cycle fatigue loading,W Chen; A Dudka; H Chen; D Mukherji; RP Wahi; H Wever,Abstract Contradictory results exist in literature about the influence of various types ofthermomechanical fatigue loading (TMF); eg in-phase (IP); out-of-phase (OP) and diamond-type cycling on the cyclic life of high temperature alloys; and about their relationships to thecyclic life of isothermal low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests at the maximum temperature of thecorresponding TMF tests [eg 1–4]. This is obviously related to the differences in the basicproperties of materials tested as well as to the details of test procedures and parametersemployed. In order to be able to understand these complicated and at times controversialrelationships it is essential to have an insight into the damage processes taking place indifferent types of alloys and under various loading conditions.,*,1996,3

Effect of Alkali Fluoride on the Short‐Range Structures of ZrF4‐BaF2‐Based Glasses,Wen‐Cai Wang; Yu Chen; Tian‐Dou Hu,Abstract The short-range structures of ZrF 4-BaF 2-based glasses with added NaF or LiF arestudied by XAFS. Their structures are compared with those of 66.7 ZrF 4· 33.3 BaF 2 and 75ZrF 4· 25 BaF 2 glasses. Adding alkali fluoride the distance and coordination number of nearneighbors around Zr decrease slightly and the coordination number about Ba is also lessthan that in binary ZrF 4–BaF 2 glasses. The mean distance between Zr and Zr suggests thatthere are F polyhedra around Zr linked by sharing the edges in the studied glasses. Theintensities of the white lines in BaL III edges of these glasses are all less than in the case ofBaF 2. They reduce much greater in glasses with added NaF or LiF.

Multiple-valued logic design based on the multiple-peak BiCMOS-NDR circuits,Kwang-Jow Gan; Jeng-Jong Lu; Wen-Kuan Yeh; Yaw-Hwang Chen; Yan-Wun Chen,Abstract Three different multiple-valued logic (MVL) designs using the multiple-peaknegative-differential-resistance (NDR) circuits are investigated. The basic NDR element;which is made of several Si-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOS)and SiGe-based heterojunction-bipolar-transistor (HBT) devices; can be implemented byusing a standard BiCMOS process. These MVL circuits are designed based on the triggering-pulse control; saw-tooth input signal; and peak-control methods; respectively. However;there are some transient states existing between the multiple stable levels for the first twomethods. These states might affect the circuit function in practical application. As a result; ourproposed peak-control method for the MVL design can be used to overcome these transientstates.,Engineering Science and Technology; an International Journal,2016,2

Effect of Al2Gd on microstructure and properties of laser clad Mg–Al–Gd coatings,Hong Chen; Ke Zhang; Chengwu Yao; Jie Dong; Zhuguo Li; Claus Emmelmann,Abstract In order to investigate the effects of Gd addition on the microstructures andproperties of magnesium coatings; the Mg–7.5 Al–xGd (x= 0; 2.5; 5.0 and 7.5 wt.%) coatingson cast magnesium alloy were fabricated by laser cladding with wire feeding. The resultsindicated that the gadolinium (Gd) addition led to the formation of a cubic Al 2 Gd phase aswell as suppressed the precipitation of eutectic Mg 17 Al 12 phase. The laser clad coatingcontaining nominally 7.5 wt.% Gd presented the highest microhardness; ultimate tensilestrength and yield strength at both room temperature and high temperatures. Theenhancement of heat resistant capacities was chiefly attributed to the existence of thermallystable Al 2 Gd particles; which prevented tiny liquation of eutectic phases along the grainboundaries and made great contributions on maintaining high yield ratio during high …,Applied Surface Science,2015,2

A novel adaptive sliding mode control of PWM rectifier under unbalanced grid voltage conditions based on direct power control,Hongjun Chen; Kai Ding; Xin Zhou; Kai Fu; Yuepeng Qu,To deal with the control problems of the three-phase PWM rectifier under the unbalancedgrid voltage conditions; this paper proposes a modified direct power control strategy usingadaptive sliding mode control algorithm with model of the PWM rectifier in stationary αβframe. The active and reactive power dynamics of the PWM rectifier are linearized anddecoupled based on the inverse system algorithm. Then a sliding mode control scheme isdesigned to improve the robustness and reduce the influences caused by the systemparameters variations and load disturbances. In order to satisfy the state requirements; anadaptive law is introduced to the control strategy to reduce the sliding mode control gain onthe premise that the system is stable. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of theproposed control strategy.,Control Conference (CCC); 2014 33rd Chinese,2014,2
Shift schedule optimization of 2-speed electric vehicle using model predictive control,Lulu Guo; Guangyu Li; Bingzhao Gao; Hong Chen,This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) gear shifting strategy for a novelelectric vehicle equipped with 2-speed Automated Manual Transmission (AMT); aiming atimproving the fuel economy and reduce frequent gear shifting.

Persistent dirac fermion state on bulk-like Si (111) surface,Jian Chen; Wenbin Li; Baojie Feng; Peng Cheng; Jinglan Qiu; Lan Chen; Kehui Wu,Abstract: The" multilayer silicene" films were grown on Ag (111); with increasing thicknessabove 30 monolayers (ML). We found that the" multilayer silicene" is indeed a bulk Si (111)film. Such Si film on Ag (111) always exhibits a root (3) xroot (3) honeycomb superstructureon surface. Delocalized surface state as well as linear energy-momentum dispersion wasrevealed by quasiparticle interference patterns (QPI) on the surface; which proves theexistence of Dirac fermions state.

Shift control of dual clutch transmission using triple-step nonlinear method,Qifang Liu; Hong Chen; Bingzhao Gao; Yuan Gao,Abstract The shift control; especially clutch slip control in inertia phase; is considered as akey issue of dual clutch transmission for improving driving comfort. For the shift is a complexnonlinear dynamic process combining engine states and road information; and these areoften variable; so the clutch control system can be described as a nonlinear parameter-varying model.

Generalization performance of bipartite ranking algorithms with convex losses,Fangchao He; Hong Chen,Abstract Previous works describing the generalization performance of bipartite rankingalgorithms are usually based on the assumption of (0–1) loss or the area under the receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve. In this paper we go far beyond this classical frameworkby investigating the generalization performance of bipartite ranking algorithms with convexlosses over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Based on the McDiarmid inequality andRademacher complexity; we establish the upper bound on the generalization error for abipartite ranking algorithm. The theoretical analysis is different from the previous results onerror analysis and shows the attractive uniform convergence property of regularized bipartiteranking algorithms.,Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications,2013,2
Nonlinear controller design for the shift control of dual clutch transmission,Tiansi Li; Qifang Liu; Hong Chen; Guo Hongyan,To improve the shift quality of vehicles equipped with dual clutch transmissions (DCTs); afeedforward-feedback control scheme is proposed for clutch slip control during the shiftinertia phase. The feedforward controller is designed based on differential flatness to track areference smooth shift trajectory while the proportional feedback controller is to handle themodel errors and disturbances.

Influence of thermal history on mesoscale ordering in polydomain smectic networks,Huipeng Chen; Ziniu Yu; Ronald C Hedden,Abstract Dramatic changes in mesoscale ordering and macroscopic mechanical behaviorare observed in smectic polydomain networks after annealing at a temperature well abovethe glass transition temperature but below the clearing temperature. Tensile testing revealsgradual stiffening and loss of extensibility; and X-ray linewidth measurements confirm thatstiffening is initially due to thickening of domains. At long annealing times; a more highlyordered smectic mesophase forms; further stiffening the networks and reducing theirextensibility. Increasing the concentration of (flexible) crosslinkers hinders domain growthand suppresses formation of the higher order mesophase; a useful guideline for design ofsmectic networks that exhibit reduced sensitivity to thermal history.© 2012 Wiley Periodicals;Inc.

A signal folding neural amplifier exploiting neural signal statistics,Yi Chen; Arindam Basu; Minkyu Je,A novel amplifier for neural recording applications that exploits the 1/fn characteristics ofneural signals is described in this paper. Comparison and reset circuits are implementedwith the core amplifier to fold a large output waveform into a preset range enabling the useof an ADC with less number of bits for the same effective dynamic range. This also reducesthe transmission data rate of the recording chip. Both of these features allow power and areasavings at the system level. At the receiver; a reconstruction algorithm is applied in thedigital domain to recover the amplified signal from the folded waveform. Other features ofthis proposed amplifier are increased reliability due to removal of pseudo-resistors; lessdistortion and low-voltage operation.

Support vector machine with orthogonal Legendre kernel,Zhi-Bin Pan; Hong Chen; Xin-Hua You,Support vector machines (SVMs) are probably the most well-known models based on kernelsubstitution. Based on orthogonal Legendre polynomials; an orthogonal Legendre kernelfunction for support vector machine is proposed using the properties of kernel functions. Wethen prove that it satisfies the Mercer condition. Compared to traditional kernel functionssuch as polynomial or gaussian kernels; orthogonal Legendre kernel can reduce theredundancy in feature space due to the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials; which mayenable the S VM to construct the separating hyperplane with less support vectors.Compared to orthogonal Chebyshev kernel function; orthogonal Legendre kernel is fasterand saves more time. Experimental results show that orthogonal Legendre kernel iscompetitive to other kernel functions.,Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR); 2012 International Conference on,2012,2

Partial Target Coverage Problem in Surveillance Sensor Networks,Yu Gu; Yusheng Ji; Hongyang Chen; Jie Li; Baohua Zhao,This paper deals with the partial target coverage (PTC) problem in wireless sensor networkswith the objective of optimizing network lifetime. We first build a linear programmingformulation; which takes total time a sensor spends on covering some targets intoconsideration; in order to obtain a lifetime upper bound. Then; based on the information ofthis formulation; we develop a sensor assignment algorithm to seek an optimal time tablemeeting the lifetime upper bound. A formal proof of optimality is given. We compare theproposed algorithm with a state-of-the-art algorithm: column generation approach and showthat the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms in terms of computational time.Experiments have been conducted to study the effect of network parameters on networklifetime and interesting insights have been offered.,Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC); 2010 IEEE,2010,2
On The Determination of The Soil-Water Characteristic Curve Using The Pressure Plate Extrator,Hui Chen; Chang-Fu Wei; Rong-Tao Yan; Pan Chen; Pan-Pan Yi,Abstract The pressure plate extractor is commonly used to measure the soil watercharacteristic curve (SWCC). In the measurement; two methods are adopted to determinethe soil water content; through weighing the soil sample and the outflow; respectively. Withthe first method; part of soil mass may lose during the operation; while with the secondmethod air bubbles may accumulate under the ceramic plate; inducing the air-waterinterfacial effect. All these factors may result in error in the measurement. To resolve theseissues; a modified method for weighing the outflow is introduced. By comparing the dataobtained with theses three methods; it is found that the method of weighing soil is suited forthe case when matric suction is large or testing time is long; whereas the method ofweighing outflow is suitable only when matric suction is small and testing time is short.

Bayesian network-Based Projected Clustering,Li-Hua Zhou; Wei-Yi Liu; Yu-Feng Xu; Hong-Mei Chen,Clustering in high dimensional data is an important task. Projected clustering has emergedas a possible solution to the challenges associated with high dimensional clustering. Aprojected cluster is a subset of points together with a subset of attributes; such that somecategory of value of cluster points has great probability in these attributes. The relationshipbetween projected cluster and Bayesian network is discussed in this paper. The dense cellscan be identified by Bayesian network; and then adjacent dense cells can be merged into aprojected cluster. It avoids the blind selection of dimension and the chicken-and-eggproblem that must identify dimensions and data objects simultaneously. It can also searchclusters on arbitrary subspace. The experiment results on categorical attributes show thatBayesian network-Based Projected Clustering performs well in high dimensional data.,Machine Learning and Cybernetics; 2008 International Conference on,2008,2

Recognition of contour line from scanned military topographic maps,Hong Chen; Xiao'an Tang; Yaoming Yang,This paper presents a method for contour lines recognition from scanned militarytopographical maps. It is a difficult process; since contour lines are always overlapped orintersected with others information; and aliasing and false colors induced by the scanningprocess. The proposed method overcomes these difficulties using a multi-step process. First;a segmentation feature set is developed to compensate color aliasing and false colors. Next;contour lines are extracted by a relaxation algorithm; which combine spatial and color spaceinformation to get more reliable result. Finally; the resulting binary image is thinned and thengeometric properties of contour line are used to match and connect broken parts. Theapproach is tested successfully on a number of common-conditioned military topographicmaps.,Information and Automation; 2008. ICIA 2008. International Conference on,2008,2

Combining near-optimal feature selection with gSpan,Karsten Borgwardt; Xifeng Yan; Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Lee Song; Alex Smola; Jiawei Han; Philip Yu; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Graph classification is an increasingly impor- tant step in numerous application domains; suchas function prediction of molecules and proteins; computerised scene analysis; and anomalydetection in program flows. Among the various approaches proposed in the literature; graphclassification based on frequent subgraphs is a popular branch: Graphs are represented as(usually binary) vectors; with components indicating whether a graph contains a particular subgraphthat is frequent across the dataset. On large graphs; however; one faces the enormous problemthat the number of these frequent subgraphs may grow exponentially with the size of thegraphs; but only few of them possess enough discriminative power to make them useful for graphclassification. Efficient and discriminative feature selection among frequent subgraphs is hencea key challenge for graph mining. In this article; we propose an approach to fea- ture …,MLG,2008,2

Heating efficiency improvement by using a spherically-concaved sectored array in focused ultrasound thermal therapy,HL Liu; HW Chen; KC Ju; TC Shih; WS Chen,Focus splitting by using sector-sectioned phased arrays is one of effective methods toincrease the necrosed volume in single sonication and to reduce the total treatment time inlarge tumor treatment. However; the split focus contains less concentrated energy andseverer focal beam distortion; which limits its usefulness in practical treatments. In this study;we proposed a new heating strategy by combining sonications of strongly-focused and split-focused patterns to increase the heating efficiency. Theoretical predictions and ex-vivotissue experiments showed that thermal lesions can be enlarged in dimensions afterapplying the proposed strategy. This may provide a useful way to solve current obstacles inlow heating efficiency of split-focus sonications that attempted to shorten the total treatmenttime in current clinical application,Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society; 2006.

Effect of soil water and fertilizer on soybean yield on loess slopeland,H Chen; M Shao; X Zhang,Abstract Studies on the effect of soil water and fertilizer on soybean yield on loess slopefarmland showed that soybean yield (Y) increased linearly with the increase of water useefficiency (WUE). Soybean yield and WUE increase with the increase of P fertilizer when Pfertilizer was applied alone; but increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of Nfertilizer when N fertilizer was applied alone. Therefore; N fertilizer should be applied with Pfertilizer. Compared to no fertilizer; fertilizer could significantly increase soybean yield andWUE by 86.76%-470.16% and 69.64%-438.47%; respectively. A combined application of Nand P fertilizers could increase more soybean yield and WUE than applied each of themalone; and the rational ratio of N and P (P2O5) was 1.3: 1.,Ying yong sheng tai xue bao= The journal of applied ecology,2003,2

Method for oil pipeline leak detection based on distributed fiber optic technology,Huabo Chen; Yaqing Tu; Ting Luo,Pipeline leak detection is a difficult problem to solve up to now. Some traditional leakdetection methods have such problems as high rate of false alarm or missing detection; lowlocation estimate capability. For the problems given above; a method for oil pipeline leakdetection based on distributed optical fiber sensor with special coating is presented. Thefiber's coating interacts with hydrocarbon molecules in oil; which alters the refractive indexedof the coating. Therefore the light-guiding properties of the fiber are modified. Thus pipelineleak location can be determined by OTDR. Oil pipeline lead detection system is designedbased on the principle. The system has some features like real time; multi-point detection atthe same time and high location accuracy. In the end; some factors that probably influencedetection are analyzed and primary improving actions are given.,Optical and Fiber Optic Sensor Systems,1998,2

Plastic Deformation-Induced Nanocrystalline Aluminum in Al-Based Amorphous Alloys,H Chen; Y He; GJ Shiflet; SJ Poon,Abstract We report the first direct observation of crystallization induced in the slipped planesof aluminum based amorphous alloys by bending the amorphous ribbons. Nanometer-sizedcrystalline precipitates are found exclusively within a thin layer (shear band) in the slippedplanes extending across the deformed amorphous alloy ribbons. It is also found that thenanocrystalline aluminum can be produced by ball-Milling. It is likely that local atomicrearrangements within the shear bands create the nanocrystals which appear after plasticdeformation.,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,1993,2

Low speed control for PMSM based on reduced-order adaptive Kalman filter,Hongjun Chen; Bo Liu; Yuepeng Qu; Xin Zhou,This paper proposes a dual reduced-order adaptive Kalman observer to estimate the rotorspeed and load torque of PMSM under low speed condition. The observed speed is moreprecise than encoder differential signals which has more noise; and the estimated torquecan be used as feedforward compensation to reduce speed ripple when load changes.Because the calculation amount of Kalman filter is proportional to its order's cube; a dualreduced-order observer is proposed. To reduce the influence of modeling errors; adaptivealgorithm with forgetting factor is proposed to calculate the noise covariance. The simulationand experiment results show the good performance of the proposed strategy.,Control Conference (CCC); 2014 33rd Chinese,2014,1
Modeling and deterministic robust control of a three-phase four-switch PWM voltage-source rectifier based on direct power control,Xin Zhou; Hongjun Chen; Hao Xu; Lin Li,This paper proposes a mathematical model of the three-phase four-switch pulse widthmodulated (PWM) voltage-source rectifier (VSR) based on direct power control (DPC). Thederived model has the advantages of specific physical meaning; more versatile and precise;and most nonlinear control strategies of six-switch VSR could be utilized for four-switch VSR.By analyzing the proposed model; the dynamic of voltage difference between the twocapacitors is considered a second-order dynamic. A compensation algorithm is applied toarrange its transition process to balance the voltage of the two capacitors. The filter inductorsmay be uncertain and the grid angular frequency changes slowly. That would lead toundesired high-order dynamic which generates more harmonics and affects the stability ofthe system.

Modified direct power control for PWM rectifier under unbalanced grid voltage conditions,Hongjun Chen; Gaoxing Xing; Xin Zhou; Ming Zhang; Yuepeng Qu,Under the unbalanced power grid voltage conditions; three-phase voltage source PWMrectifier would produce non-sinusoidal and negative sequence current; fluctuations of activeand reactive power. To deal with these problems; the mathematical model is established inthe stationary αβ frame; then a dual power control scheme is presented to control the activeand reactive power independently. By setting reference of power inner loop; the negativesequence current can be eliminated and grid current is sinusoidal. The proportionalresonant controller in the outer loop suppresses the DC-link ripple. The PI repetitive controlis applied in the inner loop to eliminate active and reactive power oscillation.

Distributed sparse channel estimation for OFDM systems with high mobility,Peng Cheng; Zhuo Chen; Lin Gui; Y Jay Guo; Meixia Tao; Yun Rui,Channel estimation for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) broadbandsystem operating with high mobility is very challenging. This is mainly due to the significantDoppler spread; inherent in a time-frequency doubly-selective (DS) channel. Consequently;a large number of channel coefficients must be estimated; forcing the need for allocating alarge number of pilot subcarriers. To address this problem; we propose a novel channelestimation method based on basis expansion models (BEMs) and distributed compressivesensing (DCS) theory. To be specific; we develop a two-stage sparse BEM coefficientsestimation method; which can effectively combat the Doppler spread and enable accuratechannel estimation with dramatically reduced number of pilot subcarriers.

Clustering Large Attributed Graph,Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,抄録 Graph clustering is a long-standing problem in data mining and machine learning.Traditional graph clustering aims to partition a graph into several densely connectedcomponents. However; with the proliferation of rich attribute information available for objectsin real-world graphs; vertices in graphs are often associated with a number of attributes thatdescribe the properties of the vertices. This gives rise to a new type of graphs; namelyattributed graphs. Thus; how to leverage structural and attribute information becomes a newchallenge for attributed graph clustering. In this paper; we introduce the state-of-the-artstudies on clustering large attributed graphs. These methods propose different approachesto leverage both structural and attribute information. The resulting clusters will have bothcohesive intra-cluster structures and homogeneous attribute values.,Information and Media Technologies,2012,1

We exploit the rank reduction approach by equippingmultiple antennas at the receiver; in which the CFO of each user is derived blindly using onedimension (1-D) search individually. The proposed scheme supports the generalizedsubcarrier assignment scheme and full loaded transmission with all subcarriers beingallocated to users. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2011); 2011 IEEE,2011,1

Internal corrosion (IC) was suspected due to suspectedpossible water intrusion into the line during upsets and due to water condensation. ICDAwas used for the pipe segment because both the gas flow and pressure were low; whichmade the line unpiggable. The four-step process described in the NACE Dry Gas ICDAStandard Practice (SP0206-2006) was attempted to be implemented while in the end thedetailed examination step was executed only with guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT)and the GWUT was performed in only two selected points. Despite the above incompliancewith NACE SP0206; a more accurate determination of the critical angle and pipeline …,CORROSION 2011,2011,1

Efficient multi-secret sharing scheme using room square,Ming-Jheng Li; Ying-Hsuan Chang; Justie Su-Tzu Juan,In 1979; secret sharing scheme was first proposed by Shamir. In a secret sharing scheme;each participant receives a secret share in such a way that only authorized subsets canreconstruct the secret. Compare with Shamir's scheme; Juan and Huang proposed anefficient secret sharing scheme from room square in 2005. Their scheme gave a practicalalgorithm to reduce the computation complexity by using room square; and obtained as (n−1; n)-threshold secret sharing scheme. However; there is not any (t; n)-threshold secretsharing scheme for t≤ n− 2 with more efficient than Shamir's scheme has been proposed.For this reason; this paper utilizes the characteristic of cycle to design four (t; n)-thresholdsecret sharing schemes for t= n− 2.

Efficient readout for carbon nanotube (CNT)-based IR detectors,Jiangbo Zhang; Ning Xi; Hongzhi Chen; King WC Lai,By forming a Schottky barrier with the contact metal; a semiconducting CNT based Schottkyphotodiode is formed at the CNT-metal contact. The photogenerated electron-hole pairswithin the depletion region of the Schottky barrier are separated by an external electricalfield or the built-in field; producing a photocurrent. How to efficiently read this photocurrentsignal out is an essential problem for the photodetectors. Since a semiconducting CNTnormally forms a Schottky barrier at each CNT-electrode contact; two Schottky photodiodesare reversely connected and their photocurrents will cancel each other; which makes itdifficult to measure the overall photocurrent. With different materials as the contactelectrodes; the asymmetric structure enlarged the difference between the two CNT-metalcontacts. Hence the measurable photocurrent is also enlarged. Furthermore; since the …,Electro-Optical and Infrared Systems: Technology and Applications IV,2007,1

The circulatory and respiratory dynamic mechanisms of lung Qi-deficiency,Wei Yao; Guanghong Ding; Xueyong Shen; Ruishang Dang; Huansheng Chen; Jing Yang; Eryu Chen; Qi Gu,Abstract As the transportation of O2 and CO2 inside human body is an integrated aspect ofQi-blood transportation; a hemodynamic model is established based on the analysis of therespiratory and circulation system. The results of such model show that the abnormality ofthe circulatory and respiratory parameters always lead to a reduction of Po2 (O2 pressure) intissue fluid; and then a Lung Qi-Deficiency Syndrome (QDS). This model can be used toquantitatively explain; to some extent; the physiological phenomena of Lung QDS; and couldcombine all the discoveries of in clinical researches; on Lung QDS. The measurement ofPo2 in tissue fluid as an index to analyze Lung QDS is in accordance with TCM and TMM(the theory of modern medicine).

We obtain the magnetization closeto the critical external magnetic field. The leading correction term determined by thescattering length among massive spinons is given. Our results are in agreement with exactresults and with experimental results. We show that the deviation from the massive free hardcore boson picture can be accounted very well by the leading correction term due to thespinon-spinon interaction. We show that the deviation increases along with the increasing ofthe Ising term.,Communications in Theoretical Physics,2001,1

Study on REE bound water-soluble polysaccharides in plant,Yuqi Wang; Fanqing Guo; Lei Xu; Hongmin Chen; Jingxin Sun; Guoyin Cao,The binding of REE with water-soluble polysaccharides (PSs) in leaves of fern DicranopterisDichotoma (DD) has been studied by molecular activation analysis. The cold-water-solubleand hot-water-soluble PSs in leaves of DD were obtained by using biochemical separationtechniques. The PSs of non-deproteinization and deproteinization; were separated onSephadex G-200 gel permeation chromatography. The absorption curves of elution for thePSs were obtained by colorimetry; and the proteins were detected using Coomassic brilliantG-250. Eight REEs (La; Ce; Nd; Sm; Eu; Tb; Yb and Lu) in these PSs were determined byinstrumental neutron activation analysis. The results obtained show that the REEs are boundfirmly with the water-soluble PSs in the plant. A measurement demonstrates that the PSsbound with REEs are mainly of smaller molecular weight (10;000 to 20;000 Dalton),Nuclear Techniques,1999,1

Hardware verification using symbolic state transition graphs,Pinhong Chen; J-M Shyu; L-G Chen,A new approach for hardware verification using symbolic state transition graphs(implemented in BDDs) is presented. We propose a novel idea; a symbolic state transitiongraph (STG); which can represent finite state machines FSM in terms of the relationsbetween symbolic input variables; state variables; and output results; rather than the exactinput-output bit patterns. Compared to conventional STG methods; the symbolic STG is moreconcise; higher-level; has fewer states and is easier to specify. Based on the transitionrelation method and an event-driven scheduling technique to compute the symbolic states;we propose two algorithms to verify the circuit implementation with respect to its symbolicSTGs. The algorithms can be used to find out a necessary condition for the implementationto satisfy the specification; which can be used for the allocation of design errors.,Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors; 1993.

Film boiling from a rotating sphere in forced convection,J Orozco; L Chen,Abstract Film boiling heat transfer fluxes were measured on a 3.84-cm rotating hollowcopper sphere in forced convection. Forced convection tests in Freon-113 were run atspeeds of 0.5 to 1.0 m/s and for sphere rotation in the range of 0 to 1500 rpm. The tests wereconducted in the stable film boiling regime of the boiling curve. The experimentalmeasurements revealed that the rotation of the heated surface enhanced the occurrence ofliquid-solid contact in film boiling. A theoretical model for flow film boiling from a sphericalheater including the effects of surface rotation is developed. The model does not account forthe occurrence of liquid-solid contacts; however; the experimental data and the theoreticalformulation show good agreement at low rpm.,International communications in heat and mass transfer,1989,1

Regularized Orthogonal Tensor Decompositions for Multi-Relational Learning,Fanhua Shang; James Cheng; Hong Cheng,Abstract: Multi-relational learning has received lots of attention from researchers in variousresearch communities. Most existing methods either suffer from superlinear per-iterationcost; or are sensitive to the given ranks. To address both issues; we propose a scalable coretensor trace norm Regularized Orthogonal Iteration Decomposition (ROID) method for full orincomplete tensor analytics; which can be generalized as a graph Laplacian regularizedversion by using auxiliary information or a sparse higher-order orthogonal iteration (SHOOI)version. We first induce the equivalence relation of the Schatten p-norm (0< p<\infty) of a lowmulti-linear rank tensor and its core tensor. Then we achieve a much smaller matrix tracenorm minimization problem. Finally; we develop two efficient augmented Lagrange multiplieralgorithms to solve our problems with convergence guarantees.

An improved deadbeat control strategy for D-STATCOM based on frequency-adaptive repetitive predictor,Hongjun Chen; Bo Sun; Jialong Qu; Kai Fu,This paper presents an improved deadbeat current control strategy based on repetitivepredictor applied to D-STATCOM for reactive power compensation. The deadbeat algorithmis used to design the current loop in α-β stationary frame. A repetitive controller is added inthe compensating current prediction to reduce prediction error and enhance the accuracy ofcontrol. Since the grid frequency variation would result in poor performance of the repetitivecontroller; a modified FIR low-pass filter with frequency adaptive function is proposed.Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.,Cyber Technology in Automation; Control; and Intelligent Systems (CYBER); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*

Materials and Methods: In this study;we introduce a new acetabular clamp and its preliminary clinical application in three T-shaped acetabular fractures. Results: This new clamp can successfully pull the posteriorcolumn back to the anterior column and firmly maintain the reduction. This clamp's aimingplate can facilitate the insertion of long lag screws. The clamp is also easy to assemble anduse. Conclusion: This reduction clamp is a useful instrument that can facilitate openreduction and internal fixation of acetabular fractures.,Indian journal of orthopaedics,2015,*
Growth of Atomically Flat Ultra-Thin Ag Films on Si (111) by Introducing a√ 3×√ 3-Ga Buffer Layer,He Jie-Hui; Jiang Li-Qun; Qiu Jing-Lan; Chen Lan; Wu Ke-Hui,Abstract It is known that; when Ag is deposited on Si (111)-7× 7 substrates in a conventionalgrowth procedure at room temperature; no atomically flat Ag film could be obtained. We usescanning tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction to investigate the growthof ultra-thin Ag films on the Si (111) substrates at room temperature. Our study reveals that;upon introducing a Si (111)-√ 3×√ 3-Ga buffer layer; atomically flat Ag films can easilygrow on Si (111) with a critical thickness of two monolayers. Moreover; Ag film growthfollows a layer-by-layer mode with further deposition. This novel growth behavior of Ag canbe explained in terms of a free electron model (ie; particle in a box) and kinetic Monte Carlosimulations.,Chinese Physics Letters,2014,*

Synergistic actions of olomoucine and bone morphogenetic protein-4 in axonal repair after acute spinal cord contusion,Liang Chen; Jianjun Li; Liang Wu; Mingliang Yang; Feng Gao; Li Yuan,Abstract To determine whether olomoucine acts synergistically with bone morphogeneticprotein-4 in the treatment of spinal cord injury; we established a rat model of acute spinalcord contusion by impacting the spinal cord at the T 8 vertebra. We injected a suspension ofastrocytes derived from glial-restricted precursor cells exposed to bone morphogeneticprotein-4 (GDAs BMP) into the spinal cord around the site of the injury; and/or olomoucineintraperitoneally. Olomoucine effectively inhibited astrocyte proliferation and the formation ofscar tissue at the injury site; but did not prevent proliferation of GDAs BMP or inhibit theireffects in reducing the spinal cord lesion cavity. Furthermore; while GDAs BMP andolomoucine independently resulted in small improvements in locomotor function in injuredrats; combined administration of both treatments had a significantly greater effect on the …,Neural regeneration research,2014,*

Using RPC as gammadetector provides an opportunity for application in positron emission tomography (PET). Inthis work; we use the GEANT4 simulation package to study various methods improving thedetection efficiency of a realistic RPC-based PET model for 511 keV photons; by addingmore detection units; changing the thickness of each layer; choosing different convertersand using the multi-gaps RPC (MRPC) technique. The balance among these factor isdiscussed. It's found that although RPC with materials of high atomic number can reach ahigher efficiency; they may contribute to a poor spatial resolution and higher backgroundlevel.,Journal of Instrumentation,2014,*

Regulation on EGFR function via its interacting proteins and its potential application,Jun-Fang Zheng; Hui-Min Chen; Jun-Qi He,Abstract Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is imptortant for cell activities;oncogenesis and cell migration; and EGFR inhibitor can treat cancer efficiently; but its sideeffects; for example; in skin; limited its usage. On the other hand; EGFR interacting proteinsmay also lead to oncogenesis and its interacting protein as drug targets can avoidcutaneous side effect; which implies possibly a better outcome and life quality of cancerpatients. For the multiple EGFR interaction proteins; B1R enhances Erk/MAPK signaling;while PTPN12; Kek1; CEACAM1 and NHERF repress Erk/MAPK signaling. CaM may altercharge of EGFR juxamembrane domain and regulate activation of PI3K/Akt and PLC-gamma/PKC. STAT1; STAT5b are widely thought to be activated by EGFR; while there isunexpectedly inhibiting sequence within EGFR to repress the activity of STATs. LRIG1 …,*,2013,*

The method preprocessed ECG anddetected QRS waves to get RR signal and ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signal. Then 40time-and spectral-domain features were extracted to normalize the signals. After that supportvector machine (SVM) was used to classify the signals as" apnea" or" normal". Finally; theperformance of the method was evaluated by the MIT-BIH Apnea-ECG database; and anaccuracy of 95% in train sets and an accuracy of 88% in test sets were achieved.,Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi= Journal of biomedical engineering= Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2013,*
Dynamic Changes of QRS Duration in Patients With Heart Failure,KD Sidhu; L Chen; R Sheldon; P Theoret-Patrick; M Luce; G Wells; A Tang,Background Heart failure (HF) is a progressive disease in spite of optimal medicalmanagement. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is an effective therapy to reduce mortality;morbidity; and HF hospitalization in HF patients with systolic dysfunction and wide QRSduration. Clinical practice guidelines suggested that a defined QRS duration is used todetermine if CRT should be used. This has an implicit assumption that a specific QRSduration defines whether the patient benefits from CRT and that QRS duration is static withminimal changes over time. However; studies have shown QRS duration increases withworsening of NYHA functional class. We hypothesize that QRS duration will progress overtime. Our objective is to review the natural history of QRS duration in patients enrolled in aheart failure clinical trial who were randomized not to receive CRT.

A Market Data Feeds Processing Accelerator Based on FPGA,Xiaoyang Shen; Jiang Jiang; Liyuan Zhou; Tianyi Yang; Li Chen,Abstract Market data feeds present the current state of the financial market to the customers;with the demand of fast transmission and instant response. The OPRA format with the FASTprotocol is one of the most widely-used formats of the market data feeds. This paperprovides an accelerator based on FPGA for processing the market data feeds in OPRAformat. The accelerator focuses on encoding and decoding the data feeds concerning five ofthe most important categories; namely categories a; d; k; q and N. Since each OPRA blockmay have various possibilities of components; which have different lengths; so the latency ofour design varies. Under extreme conditions; the encoder portion has the minimum latencyof 72 ns and the maximum latency of 424 ns; while the decoder portion has the minimumlatency of 48 ns and the maximum latency of 344 ns.,CCF National Conference on Compujter Engineering and Technology,2013,*
Security Analysis of a Paillier-Based Threshold Proxy Signature Scheme,Minghui Zheng; Yongquan Cui; Liang Chen,A (t; n)-threshold proxy signature scheme allows an original signer to delegate the signingcapability to a group of n proxy members in such a way that any t or more than t proxysigners can generate a valid signature on behalf of the original signer. Recently; Ting etal.[1] proposed the first threshold proxy signature scheme from Paillier cryptosystem; andclaimed that their construction is existentially unforgeable against chosen-message attacksand chosen-warrant attacks in the random oracle model. In this paper; however; we showthat their scheme is insecure against a type II adversary who can access the secret key ofthe original signer; ie; not only the proxy signers but also the original signer can generate avalid proxy signature. In addition; we analyze the causes of the attack and further discuss thepossibility of avoiding the attack by improving the Ting et al.'s scheme.,Trust; Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom); 2013 12th IEEE International Conference on,2013,*

A complete; rigorous theoretical framework is then adopted for the energeticsanalysis of these ISWs. It is found that ISWs contain most of the baroclinic energy in theinternal wave field. The nonhydrostatic energy flux is in opposite direction to the hydrostaticand nonlinear fluxes. For fixed tidal excursion parameter (ε); the nonlinear portion of the totalbaroclinic flux decreases as the slope parameter (γ) increases. In addition; the ISW energy;energy flux and barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion rate all peak when the bottomtopography is critical (γ= 1).

Numerical Investigation of a Piloted Premixed Jet Burner,Yuntao Chen; Matthias Ihme,Abstract Premixed and partially premixed combustion technologies have the potential ofreducing pollutant emissions and enhancing the overall combustion efficiency. However; thesuccessful implementation of these technologies in practical systems requires a thoroughunderstanding of the underlying combustion-physical phenomena. To predict partiallypremixed combustion; a three-stream progress-variable model has been developed. Thismodel is applied to large-eddy simulations of the piloted premixed jet burner experiment ofDunn et al.; and configurations PM1-{50;100;150} are considered. Comparisons withmeasurements for all three configurations are presented; and it is shown that this model iscapable of capturing the characteristics of the flow-field; temperature; and compositionalfield.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2012,*

A Novel Sub-optimum Data Transmission Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks,Jin Wang; Bo Tang; Tinghuai Ma; Yuhui Zheng; Jeong-Uk Kim,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of a large number of sensornodes that are densely deployed either inside the phenomenon or very close to it. Energyefficiency and network lifetime are two challenges that most of researchers deal with. Ingeneral; base station (BS) used to retrieve data from sensor nodes is far from the sensorfield and how to adjust the communication between nodes and BS to achieve energyefficiency and long network lifetime is very important. In this paper; we propose a novel sub-optimum Average Lifetime-oriented Long-distance (ALL) data transmission algorithm. Itmakes tradeoff between energy cost and residual energy and balances lifetime among allsensor nodes to achieve dramatic lifetime prolongation for network.

A theoretical study of the dependence of the ASxSi6− x cluster structures and properties on composition,Aimei Gao; Guoliang Li; David Finlow; Hongyu Chen; Qian‐Shu Li,Abstract The effect of the composition ratio between arsenic and silicon atoms on thestructures and properties of As x Si 6− x (x= 0–6) have been systematically investigatedusing the density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311+ G* level. The As x Si 6− x clustersprefer substitutional rather than attaching structures; the Si-rich clusters favor Si 6-likestructures; whereas the As-rich clusters prefer As 6-like structures. The As atoms locating atthe framework may explain the difficulty of removal of arsenic impurities from polycrystallinesilicon. In general; the average binding energies gradually decrease; implying the As x Si 6−x clusters become increasingly unstable as x increases. Both the HOMO-LUMO gaps andthe As-dissociation energies present a strong even–odd alternation; implying alternatingchemical stability; with the even x members being more stable than the odd ones.

Reduced emotional mirroring in Parkinson Disease,A Pohl; S Anders; K Reetz; H Chen; H Patel; K Mathiak; F Binkofski,Besides motor symptoms; Parkinson Disease (PD) is characterized by cognitive andaffective impairments. For example; a facial emotion recognition deficit has often beenreported (Grey & Tickle-Degnen; 2010). Neuroimaging studies suggest that perception andexecution of emotional facial expressions are closely linked by mirror neurons in the parsopercularis and that the activation of these neurons during perception triggers intentionunderstanding (Hennenlotter et al.; 2005). The goal of our study was to examine the neuralcorrelates of emotion processing in PD. Nine patients with PD and nine matched controlsunderwent functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Stream Maximization Transmission for MIMO System with Limited Feedback Unitary Precoding,Qiu Chen; Chen Peng; Gui Lin,Abstract Limited feedback precoding significantly improves multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) link reliability with a small amount of feedback from the receiver back to thetransmitter. One of the key problems linked to LFP is about the selection criteria of theoptimal precoder index (PMI) from a codebook. In this paper; we find that the conventionalPMI selection criteria under the stream maximization transmission (SMT) will be ineffectivewhen the linear equalizers are employed at the receiver. Inspired by this discovery; a newsingular value decomposition (SVD) based criterion activating the PMI selection for the SMTis proposed; which is accessible to both zero-foring (ZF) and minimum mean square error(MMSE) equalizer. Extensive numerical results are provided to substantiate theeffectiveness of the proposed criterion.,*,2012,*

In order to help designersmake better use of ergonomics data; we explored the potential of representing existingergonomics data in a more dynamic and visual way; and making them look more relevant todesign. The Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) was adopted to turn static ergonomicsdata into manipulative and comparative data sets. Contextual information in a visual formatwas added; clearer illustrations and scenarios relevant to design were developed; designcase studies were compiled and linked to the relevant ergonomics data sets–the processresulted in a new design support tool: the ErgoCES.

Identifying and Classifying Named Entities from Click-through Data Effectively,Xuan Jiang; Hongyan Liu; Hong Cheng; Jun He; Xiaoyong Du,ABSTRACT This paper addresses the problem how to identify named entities from click-through data and classify them into predefined domains accurately. Named EntityIdentification is essentially useful in many applications such as relevance search and querysuggestion. This paper proposes a novel measurement to measure the importance ofcontexts (ie the remaining terms of queries after removing the named entity) and develop aprobabilistic model to rank the identified named entities. To make the model more robust; themethod not only considers context information and click information like previous works; butalso combines session information. To improve the recall of the identification; the extractionand ranking steps are designed to iterate in a bootstrapping manner. Experimental resultsconducted on a real click-through data show that the method outperforms other state-of …,Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on E-Business Intelligence (ICEBI2010);,2010,*

Electrodynamic behaviour of nematic liquid crystal in a relaxation process,HY Chen; KX Yang; ZY Lin,Abstract Transient discharging current and oscillation of the birefringence in a nematic liquid-crystal (LC) cell upon the removal of the applied step voltage have been studied. Theobservations gave the evidence that the reorientation of the LC director has been inducedby the effect of adsorbed ions. In this study; we proposed a theoretical model that candescribe the transient behaviour of the director; and can also be used to estimate the ionicmobility from the experimental data. The oscillation behaviour of birefringence in both thecharging and discharging processes can be explained by both the external-field-inducedand adsorbed-ion-induced orientations of the director. The experimental observations andthe derivative parameters could be helpful for understanding the ionic effects in LC and thedirector electrodynamics in such a system.,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2010,*

Renal cell carcinomas lack arginosuccinate synthetase expression and respond to pegylated arginine deiminase treatment,Wei He; Jianhe Chen; Yuhui Zheng; Zaoming Dai; Yan He; Bor-Wen Wu; John Bomalaski,Biomarkers may be predictive of benefit from therapy. As a result; there is increasing interestin determining new biomarkers and new agents that may target specific pathways that areabnormal in a certain cancer. Normal cells produce arginine internally via the urea cycle.However; certain cancer cells lack one of the urea cycle enzymes; argininosuccinatesynthetase (ASS) and become dependent upon an exogenous supply of arginine for growthand survival. For these ASS-deficient cancers; preferential killing of tumor cells induced byarginine deprivation may be effective and safe. ADI-PEG20 is a microbial enzyme; argininedeiminase conjugated with polyethylene gycol. The primary mechanism of action of ADI-PEG20 is arginine deprivation. Thus cancers that are deficient in ASS expression andrequire arginine could benefit from ADI-PEG20. ADI-PEG20 has been in phase 2 clinical …,*,2010,*

Cross-layer operation aided wireless networks,Hong Chen,In this thesis; we propose several cross-layer operation aided schemes conceived forwireless networks. Cross layer design may overcome the disadvantages of the network'slayered architecture; where layering is most typically represented by the Transport ControlProtocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) suite. We invoke Fountain codes for protecting filetransfer at the application layer; since they are suitable for erasure channels. They are alsooften referred to as rateless codes. When implementing Fountain code aided file transfer; thefile will be firstly partitioned into a number of blocks; each of which contains K packets.Fountain codes randomly select several packets from a block and then combine them usingexclusive-OR additions for generating an encoded packet. The encoding continues until allblocks are successfully received. Considering an 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network …,*,2010,*

Synthesis of 3a; 4; 5; 6-Tetrahydroimidazo-[1; 5-b] isoxazoles,L Lu; W Cao; J Chen; H Zhang; J Zhang; H Chen; J Wei; H Deng; M Shao,Significance: Described is the 1; 3-dipolar cycloaddition of perfluoro-2-alkynoates with cyclicnitrones to afford 2-perfluoroalkyl-3a; 4; 5; 6-tetrahydroimidazo [1; 5-b] isoxazoles. Thereaction occurs under mild conditions and in short reaction times. Yields are good (R2=electron-withdrawing) to excellent (R2= electron-donating). The authors attribute the highefficiency in the reaction to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of RF according to theFMO theory. The reaction is highly regioselective resulting in the formation of a singleregioisomer with RF at position 2 of the tetrahydroimidazo [1; 5-b] isoxazole. The reaction isalso highly diastereospecific due to the approach of the alkynoate from the less stericallyhindered side of the plane; affording a pair of enantiomers with a cis stereochemistry (Phand R2 on the same side).

Effect of B doping on environmental embrittlement of disordered and ordered Ni_3Fe alloys,Bo HONG; Xiao-ying CHENG; Hong-yuan CHEN; Jie MA,In order to understand the mechanism of H2-induced environmental embrittlement andboron effect on inhibitting this kind of embrittlement in intermetallics; the effects of borondoping on the sensitivity to environmental embrittlement of disordered and ordered Ni3Fealloys and on its intergranular depth after hydrogen charging were investigated. The resultsshow that boron can similarly reduce hydrogen diffusion along grain boundary in bothdisordered and ordered Ni3Fe alloys. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient in disordered Ni3Fealloy is always larger than that in ordered Ni3Fe alloy with or without boron. This suggeststhat the effect of boron on suppressing H2-induced environmental embrittlement in orderedNi3Fe alloys can not be simply attributed to the fact that boron retards hydrogen diffusionalong grain boundaries.,The Chinese Journal of Nonferrous Metals,2009,*

A New Nonlinear Approach to Analyze Heart Rate Variability Using Dot Map Based on First Order Difference Sequence,Feng Wen; Yi Pan; Hang Chen; Xuan Wang; Shuming Ye; Kai Jiang,In this work we present a new approach of dot map to analyze heart rate variability (HRV);using the sequence of RR intervals by first order difference; which is based on the mappingapproach of Poincare plots. We analyze the characteristic of the plot to obtain its indexes toexpress HRV; and to detect kinds of premature beats from its ectopic plots area. As thenatural RR interval of heart beats vary slowly and there is a complete compensation of RRinterval after the premature beat; the plots had especial characteristic of mapping and alsohad some peculiar isolated areas of mapping by academic logic. This approach of mappingplots was proved to be correct by test using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. It indicates thatour new approach of plots have a good advantage to distinguish premature beats ofisolated; bigeminy; trigeminy from normal beats; especially from ECG data contained …,Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering; 2008.

Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus orf25 encodes a 30kDa late protein in the infection cycle,Haiyan Wang Keping Chen; Zhongjian Guo Qin Yao,Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) orf25 gene was characterized for the first time.The coding sequence of Bm25 was amplified and subcloned into the prokaryotic expressionvector pGEX-4T-2 to produce glutathione S-transferase-tagged fusion protein in the BL21(DE3) cells. The GST-Bm25 fusion protein was expressed efficiently after induction withIPTG. The purified fusion protein was used to immunize New Zealand white rabbits toprepare polyclonal an-tibody. Temporal expression analysis revealed a 30-kDa protein;which was detected beginning 24 hours post-infection using a polyclonal antibody againstGST-Bm25 fusion protein. The transcript of Bm25 was detected by RT-PCR at 18-72 h pi Incon-clusion; the available data suggest that Bm25 encodes a 30kDa protein expressed inthe late stage of infection cycle.,Acta Microbiologica Sinica,2008,*

Singularity spectra analysis of the ST segments of 12-lead electrocardiogram,J Wang; X Ning; Y Xu; Q Ma; Y Chen; D Li,Abstract By analysing the f (a) singularity spectra of the ST segments of the synchronous 12-lead ECG; we have found that the singularity spectrum is close to monofractality and its areais only half the area of the synchronous 12-lead ECG f (alpha) singularity spectrum. The STsegments of the synchronous 12-lead ECG signal also has f (alpha) singularity spectradistribution and it also has a reasonable varying scope. We have also found that the leadnumber of the ST segment f (alpha) singularity spectra for adults having coronary heartdisease overstep the reasonable scope tends to increase over that of the ECG f (alpha)singularity spectra. These findings show that using the ST segments f (alpha) singularityspectra distribution of the synchronous 12-lead ECG is more effective than using thesynchronous 12-lead ECG on the clinical analysis.,Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi= Journal of biomedical engineering= Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2007,*

Inversion of the Wideband High-frequency Electromagnetic Data,Shengtan Zheng; Zhao-Fa Zeng; SX Liu; Fengshan Liu,Abstract—To estimate the underground resistivity and permittivity; the nonlinearleastsquares inverse method based on Monte-Carlo algorithms is applied in this paper toinverse the ellipse polarization data of wideband high-frequency electromagnetic (WHFEM)method. From the inversion cases; the nonlinear least-squares inverse method can executewell in the half-space or two layer earth. In order to reduce to unstable and increaseconvergence; the Monte-Carlo algorithm is used for multiple layers model. In the secondpart; we also adopt the phasor vectorgraph method for fast inversion of apparent resistivityand permittivity which is helpful to geology mapping or initialization for the least-squaresinversion.,PIERS Online,2007,*

Combined Power and Rate Control for Integrated Voice and Data Transmission Systems,Yanrong Zhang; Hong Chen; Pingzhi Fan,In this paper; two combined power and rate control (CPRC) algorithms; without-priorityCPRC and priority-based CPRC; are proposed for the uplink of a cellular system integratedconstant bit rate (CBR) voice and variable bit rate (VBR) data transmission. The CBR usersand the VBR users are treated equally when assigning power and rate by the without-priorityCPRC algorithm; while the CBR users are given higher priority by the priority-based CPRCalgorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can provide betterperformance than SPC (selective power control) algorithm proposed by S.-L. Kim.Comparing with the without-priority CPRC; the priority-based CPRC can provide loweroutage probability for CBR users and less transmission power at the cost of throughput ofVBR users under heavy system load.,Communications and Networking in China; 2006.

411. The Metabolic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in PKU Mice after PAH Gene Treatment,Li Chen; Savio LC Woo,Abstract Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder secondary to a hepatic deficiency ofphenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that predisposes affected individuals to the developmentof severe mental retardation. PAH is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion ofphenylalanine to tyrosine; and its deficiency leads to hyperphenylalaninemia as well ashypopigmentation in patients. We have previously reported a transgene delivery systembased on phiBT1 bacteriophage integrase that result in targeted insertion of transgenes intothe mammalian genome; and the use of it to transfer a CAG-driven mouse PAH cDNAexpression cassett in the hepatocytes of PKU mice. While complete and permanentcorrection of their disease phenotypes was achieved in the treated males; only partialcorrection of hyperphenylalaninemia was achieved in the treated females that did not …,Molecular Therapy,2006,*
H11 Kinase promotes a genomic program of metabolic survival in the heart,Li Wang; Hongyu Qiu; Li Chen; Christophe Depre,Abstract H11 Kinase (H11K) is a heat-shock protein accumulating in heart from patients withheart disease. This increase was reproduced in a cardiac-specific transgenic (TG) mousemodel; which results in a cardioprotection equivalent to ischemic preconditioning. Suchprotection is associated with the activation of two survival pathways; Akt and the 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However; Akt and AMPK have opposite effects on cellgrowth through a reciprocal regulation of mTOR. Therefore; in this study; we tested thehypothesis that the respective role of Akt and AMPK in cell growth versus survival is relatedto their subcellular distribution. Hearts from TG mice showed an increased phosphorylationof Akt by 3-fold and of AMPK by 2-fold (both; P< 0.05 vs WT). Subcellular fractionationshowed a 4-fold accumulation of both enzymes in the nuclear fraction of TG hearts (P< …,The FASEB Journal,2006,*

Learning Alfvén wave properties from electrons measured by near-earth satellite,L Chen; CA Kletzing; S Hu,Abstract Inertial Alfvén waves propagating along auroral field lines can produce distinctelectron signatures through both resonant and non-resonant interaction with electrons.These signatures vary with observation altitudes. We discuss the cases when there are dcpotential drops to produce primary auroral electrons. We show simulation results of electronsignatures from below the altitude where Alfvén speed (V_A) peaks to that above it; andcompare with Alfvén-wave associated electron energy fluxes that are observed by Freja andFAST satellite. Below the peak V_A altitude; both resonant and non-resonant interactionproduce time-dispersed electron fluxes with the non-resonant dispersion a steeper slope.Above the peak V_A altitude; electron signatures due to resonant interaction remain time-dispersed; while those due to non-resonant interaction become dispersionless.

Hybrid Simulations of Global Magnetospheric Alfven-Ballooning Eigenmodes,S Hu; L Chen,Abstract A two-dimensional (2D) gyrokinetic-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) hybridsimulation code has been developed to investigate radially global Alfven-Ballooning modeskinetically excited in the Earth's magnetosphere. The theoretical model is based on thegyrokinetic formulation for two-component (core and energetic) plasmas [Chen andHasegawa; 1991]. The Alfvenic modes; supported by the core-component ideal MHD fluid;are destabilized by the energetic ions via drift-bounce resonances and are possiblecandidates for the observed Pc 4-5 geomagnetic pulsations. Two types of global Alfven-Ballooning modes are found to be radially localized in the strong kinetic drive region.

Adaptation of the ATHLET code to ADS applications,HY Chen; X Cheng; HJ Neitzel,Full text of publication follows: In Europe; heavy liquid metal (HLM); such as lead bismutheutectic (LBE); is considered as the reference coolant for both the subcritical reactor coreand the spallation target of an accelerator driven subcritical reactor system (ADS) due to itslow melting point; efficient heat removal properties and high production rate of neutrons.System analysis is required for the thermal hydraulic design of both the reactor coolingsystem and the spallation target cooling system of ADS. Since many years; theForschungszentrum Karlsruhe has been strongly involved in the design of different kinds ofspallation targets. Two independent one-dimensional system codes; HETRAF and HERETA;have been developed and applied to the design analysis of various spallation targets ofADS. Most recently; the system analysis code ATHLET; which was developed at the …,*,2005,*

Transition Moving Horizon Estimation Using Multiple Linear Models,Hai-Yan Zhao; Hong Chen,By transition estimation; it is meant a type of estimation method that is employed when theplant transitions from one operating state to another as a result of a set point change. Thispaper proposes an intelligent multiple model approach called moving horizon Bayesianestimation (MHBE) that can estimate the states of a nonlinear plant effectively. The nonlinearplant operates in multiple regimes and makes transitions between them. It is often difficult toobtain a single nonlinear model that accurately describes the plant in all regimes. Analternative approach is presented where local linear models are identified at each differentoperating point; and moving horizon estimation is performed by tracking the transitions fromone regime to another. In this paper; simulation results for a numerical example andcomparison results with the Kalman estimator are given; the result indicate that the …,Machine Learning and Cybernetics; 2005.

Inverse optimal constrained input-to-state stabilization of nonlinear systems,Tianshi Chen; Zhiyuan Liu; Hong Chen; Run Pei,A system with both control and disturbance inputs is constrained input-to-state stabilizable ifthere exist feedback control laws that render the closed-loop system constrained input-to-state stable (cISS) with respect to the disturbance. Based on a control Lyapunov function;Sontag type controllers to the constrained input-to-state stabilization problem is constructedfor a class of nonlinear systems; and it is shown that input-to-state stabilizability implies(arbitrary) constrained input-to-state stabilizability; but the converse is not true. Moreover; theconstrained input-to-state stabilizability is both necessary and sufficient for the solvability ofan inverse optimal problem. The designed controllers remain cISS against a certain class ofinput uncertainties; even input unmodeled dynamics.,American Control Conference; 2005. Proceedings of the 2005,2005,*

224 INEFFECTIVE MACROPHAGE RESPONSE IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY OF NEONATAL MICE MAY LEAD TO CEREBRAL LISTERIOSIS,P Karimi; R Jeyarajah; M Keilar; R John; L Chen; V Bhagat; CY Lu,Introduction Neonates have an increased risk of sepsis and meningitis. Despite modernantibiotics and other therapies; mortality remains high. Using a murine model ofintraperitoneal listeriosis; we now characterize the defective responses in the neonatalperitoneum; liver; and spleen. We find that these deficits ultimately lead to CNS infection in100% of the neonates. In contrast; virtually no adults developed CNS listeriosis. Methods Weinjected intraperitoneal Listeria monocytogenes to adult male Balb/C mice (4-6 weeks) andneonatal mice (3-5 days) at 4.2× 105 and 150/g body weight respectively. We sacrificedgroups of animals (n= 4 to10) at 1; 6; 24; 48; and 72 hours post infection for peritoneal fluidanalysis (total and differential cell count as well as bacterial counts) and spleen; liver; andbrain (for viable bacterial counts).

Fermi surface investigation in the scanning tunneling microscopy of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8,KK Voo; Wen-Chin Wu; Hong-Yi Chen; CY Mou,Abstract Within the ideal Fermi liquid picture; the impurity-induced spatial modulation of localdensity of states (LDOS) in the d-wave superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 is investigatedat different superconducting (SC) gap sizes. These LDOS spectra are related to the finite-temperature dI/dV spectra in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM); when the Fermidistribution factor is deconvoluted away from dI/dV. We find stripe-like structures even in thezero gap case due to a local-nesting mechanism. This mechanism is different from the octet-scattering mechanism in the d-wave SC (dSC) state proposed by McElroy et al.[K. McElroy;RW Simmonds; JE Hoffman; DH Lee; J. Orenstein; H. Eisaki; S. Uchida; JC Davis; Nature422 (2003) 592]. The zero gap LDOS is related to the normal state dI/dV.

While the core component;as the ideal MHD fluid; supports the Alfvén wave oscillations; the energetic componentprovides the kinetic instability drive via wave-particle resonances. Our preliminary studieshave indicated that; given sufficiently strong energetic-particle drive; the excited Alfvén-ballooning modes can be radially trapped in the maximal kinetic drive region to form a 2Dglobal unstable eigenmode; contrast to MHD predictions of no radial potential wellstructures. In the nonlinear state; our present focus is on the saturation mechanism of a …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2004,*
Dynamical analysis of the nonlinearity in the model of acute myocardial ischemia,Ying Chen; Xinbao Ning; Jun Wang,Abstract By analyzing the electrocardiosignals; many scholars have found remarkable andoutstanding dynamic characteristics in both normal hearts and sick hearts. Based on thosefindings; a model of acute myocardial ischemia of six rabbits is designed by us and ispresented here. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of different time series are calculated;and the figures of correlation dimensions-time and the maximum Lyapunov exponents-timeare given. The results show that the existence of myocardial ischemia will bring the declineof the value of maximum Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions; after the figuresbeing analyzed with electrophysiological and anatomical knowledge. The maximumLyapunov exponents of ECG demonstrate the chaotic quality of the system and thecorrelation dimension of ECG demonstrates the complexity of the system; and there is no …,Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi= Journal of biomedical engineering= Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2004,*

Superstructure of Nanoparticle Assembly by HAADF-STEM,ZY Li; Y Chen; J Yuan; RE Palmer; JP Wilcoxon,Nanostructure fabrication is a critical area of nanotechnology. With the recently acquiredability to prepare monodispersed nanoparticles; it is hoped that self-assembly of thesenanoparticles can lead to unique optical and electronic properties. Preparation of colloidalcrystals of monodispersed nanoparticles has been successful; yet the reliable fabrication oflow-dimensional superstructures of nanoparticles is challenging. The delicate balancebetween the weak interaction energy and the entropic contribution lead to rich phenomenain self-assembly of nanoparticle arrays. Characterisation of such nanostructures is verydemanding in Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) because of the weak nanoparticle-substrate interaction compared to the relative strong tip-particle interaction.

Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury prevented by a novel inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor; FR260330; in nonhuman primates,S Qi; D Xu; A Ma; X Zhang; Y Wang; H Gao; N Chida; Y Sudo; K Tamura; H Chen,Background: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury can be involved in almost all tissues andorgans during pathosis. Over the past decade; an enormous number of studies havefocused on the role of nitric oxide (NO). Cytotoxic nitric oxide (NO) is produced duringischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Therefore;continuous iNOS inhibition might prevent early graft dysfunction. FR260330 is a potent andselective inhibitor of iNOS activity by preventing iNOS monomers from dimerization. In thisstudy; the effect of FR260330 in prevention of renal I/R injury was evaluated in the model ofone kidney ischemia in Vervet monkeys.,Transplantation,2004,*

Electron Dispersion Below Inverted-V Energies: Resonant Deceleration and Acceleration by Alfvén Waves,L Chen; CA Kletzing; S Hu,Abstract We report on studies of resonant interactions of inertial Alfvén waves with electronsalong auroral field lines. The electrons in resonance can be accelerated or decelerated bythe parallel electric field of the wave depending on whether the velocity of the electrons isless or greater than the Alfvén wave velocity. In this paper; we emphasize the resonantdeceleration process and its effects on electrons that have gone through a parallel potentialdrop (the inverted-V electrons). When the backscattered population is included; acombination of resonant acceleration and deceleration effects accounts well for rocketobservations of electron energy dispersion extending from the inverted-V energies to lowerenergy. Characteristics of the dispersion tail such as the dispersion time scale and theintensity distribution along the tail may be used to deduce the Alfvén wave properties and …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2003,*

These are observable by scanning tunneling experiment.When there exists a sub-dominant s-wave component in addition to dominant d_x^ 2-y^ 2-wave gap; quasi-one-dimensional-like modulations are obtained which are mostconspicuous at higher biases and easily understood by the local nesting effect for a Fermiliquid. If the proposed modulations are observed; it would lead to a unified picture amongangle-resolved photoemission; inelastic neutron scattering; and scanning tunnelingmeasurements that YBCO is a good``Fermi liquid''with a sub-dominant s-wave component inthe superconducting gap.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2003,*

Hybrid Simulations of Nonlinear Magnetospheric Alfven Waves,S Hu; L Chen; S Dettrick,Abstract A two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic-gyrokinetic hybrid particle-in-cell initial-value code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear evolution of Alfven-ballooningmodes destabilized by the drift-bounce resonance of energetic particles in the Earth'smagnetosphere. The physical model is based on the analytical formulation developed fortwo-component (core and energetic) plasmas by Chen and Hasegawa [1991]. In theconditions of interest; the core component supports the magnetohydrodynamic Alfvenoscillations; while the energetic component provides the instability drive. Recent one-dimensional linear investigations have numerically demonstrated the energetic particleresonant excitation along a single field line [Dettrick; Chen; Zheng; 2002].

Preliminary analysis on copia-like retrotransposons in Amaranthus,SHuye Jiang; Mei Sun; Yuqingx He; Hong Chen; Qifeng Chen,Abstract Four species of Amaranthus were first detected to contain copia-likeretrotransposons; further confirming the ubiquity of copia-like retrotransposons in higherplants. 53 reverse transcriptase (RT) domains were amplified through PCR with 27 genomeDNAs from 4 species as templates. RT sequencing indicated that RT domains showed theirpolymorphism in their length. It was concluded that the heterogeneity of RT domains wasfound not only in different species; but also in an individual with the same genotype ordifferent individuals of the same species. Southern blot indicated that amaranth genomecontained multiple copies of retrotransposons. Northern blot showed that copia-likeretrotransposons might have lost their transpositional activities. We also tried to identify full-length copia-like retrotransposons through PCR.

One maincomponent of an ADS is the spallation target; which mainly consists of a beam windowseparating the evacuated proton beam pipe from the heavy liquid metal spallation area. Thebeam window is exposed to a high radiation and thermal field. Thus; cooling of the beamwindow is considered as one of the most critical issues in designing a spallation target. Inspite of many proposals worldwide for liquid metal target designs; most work on beamwindow cooling remains in the stage of theoretical investigations.

The mechanism of reversible conductance transitions induced in nanometer-scale regions of a crystalline thin-film,Hongjun Gao; Karl Sohlberg; ZQ Xue; HY Chen; LP Ma; SJ Pang; Stephen J Pennycook,Abstract A crystalline thin-film organic complex of 3-nitrobenzal malononitrile and 1; 4-phenylenediamine (NBMN-pDA); exhibits reversible conductance transitions on the sub-nanometer scale when exposed to local electric field pulses. Conductance transitions canalso be induced on a macroscopic scale; and both macroscopic and local current-voltage(I/V) measurements show similar electrical bistability behavior. Several hypothesizedmechanisms for the electrical bistability are subjected to experimental and theoretical tests. Itis consistent with all experimental and theoretical results that the transition mechanisminvolves the electric field pulse introducing local disorder into the crystalline thin film.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2000,*
Focus: Toward the Next Generation CD,Andrew Gannon,From punch cards to floppy disks to CD-ROM's; data storage devices continue to evolve. Researchersat the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee don't know what the next devicewill look like; but they believe they know what it will be made of: thin films of complex organiccompounds. They report in the 21 February PRL that they have produced reversible changesin electrical resistance in molecule-sized regions of organic thin films. The results help pavethe way for making thin-film storage devices because they mark the first time anyone has demonstratedreversibility–needed for “writing” and then “erasing” data–at a molecular level … Other researchershave shown they could induce changes in conductance–the equivalent of “writing”–to a thinfilm; says Karl Sohlberg; a theoretician with the Oak Ridge group. But using only heat or laserpulses; they haven't been able to “erase;” or reverse; the transition without clearing entire …,Physics,2000,*

Cloning of genes associated with taxol-induced apoptosis of human breast cancer cells,L Chen; S Zheng; MC Willingham; W Fan,Abstract The method of mRNA differential display was employed to isolate expressing genesinvolved in taxol-induced apoptosis of human breast cancer cells (BCap 37). Resultsdemonstrated that the expressive alteration of twelve clones isolated was associated withtaxol-induced apoptosis identified by Northern blot. cDNA sequence of clone C3P3 washighly homologous (99%) to human S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) synthetase.Increased transcriptional level of clone C3P3 induced by taxol was parallel to enhancedenzyme activity of S-AdoMet synthetase. These results suggested that the expression ofthese clones isolated by the mRNA differential display be possibly involved in the regulationof taxol-induced apoptosis. Their function in details need further study.,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao. Acta Academiae Medicinae Sinicae,1997,*

Feedforward Active Noise Electronic Muffler Based on the H2 and H (subscript∞) Controller Synthesis,Mingsian Bai; Hsingpu Chen,Three active noise control methods on the basis of feedforward H2; H (subscript∞); andmodified H2 optimal model matching principle are proposed. These methods effectivelyovercome the problem of unstable inverse plant resulted from the inherent nonminimumphase property of the cancellation path. The third method effectively eliminates the high-gainproblem of the ordinary H2 and H (subscript∞) algorithms. The proposed algorithms areimplemented by using a digital signal processor. The experimental results obtained by usingthe H2; H (subscript∞); modified H2 feedforward techniques show comparable attenuationfor stationary noises in a duct as the conventional methods. The proposed methods alsohave potential in suppressing transient noises that have been the major difficulty to theadaptive methods.,中華民國振動與噪音工程學會論文集,1996,*
X-ray Diffraction Investigations of C_60/Si and C_60/Ge Interfaces,RD Aburano; Hawoong Hong; K-S Chung; H Chen; T-C Chiang; P Zschack,Abstract Grazing-incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction has been used to study theinterfacial structure between C_60 overlayers and the (100) and (111) faces of Si and Ge.C_60 films ranging from 200Åto 350Åwere deposited onto room-temperature substratesprepared in ultra-high vacuum. The buried interface retained the periodicities of the Si (100)-(2× 1); Ge (100)-(2× 1); and Si (111)-(7× 7) clean surface reconstructions. In fact; the atomicfeatures of these reconstructions from the dimerized (100) surface to the adatoms of the Si(111)-(7× 7) surface were preserved. In contrast; the Ge (111)-c (2× 8) clean surfacereconstruction transformed to a Ge (111)-(1× 1) structure after C_60 adsorption. This is notsurprising since we have found most reconstructed surfaces revert to a bulk-like (1× 1)structure at an interface formed with C_60.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,1996,*

Combined natural convection and radiation heat transfer in a vertical air cavity with hexagonal honeycomb core of negligible thickness,Y Asako; Y Yamaguchi; L Chen; M Faghri,Combined natural convection and radiation heat transfer in a vertical air cavity with a hexagonalhoneycomb core of negligible thickness are investigated numerically. The numerical methodologyis based on an algebraic coordinate transformation and finite volume technique. Temperatureof the honeycomb core wall is determined such that radiation; convection and conduction energybalances on the core wall are satisfied. The computations were performed for Ra = 10{sup 3}to 10{sup 5}; for an aspect ratio of H/L = 1; for Pr = 0.7; and for wide range of emissivities. Heattransfer rates by both convection and radiation are presented as a function of emissivity; andthe effect of radiation on the natural convection is discussed. The results showed natural convectionis affected by radiation although the layer is filled with a transparent gas. This effect is accentuatedin the case of a very thin wall … Please see Document Availability for additional …,*,1995,*

Transient grating studies of nonlinear photoacoustic effects in particulate solutions,GJ Diebol; HX Chen; YN Cao; MB Zimmt,Experiments where transient grating signals are recorded from irradiation or particulatematter are reported. A relatively low power; picosecond laser produces transient gratingsignals in reverse micellar solutions that have a unique time dependence; and which can beexplained by heat diffusion from the interior of the micelle to a surrounding organic solvent.A 16‐ns‐long; high‐power pulse from a Q‐switched ND: YAG laser irradiating a gold solproduces a diffracted light signal that is explainable in terms of a thermally generatedphotoacoustic effect. Particulate carbon; on the other hand; gives transient grating signalsthat appear to possess an overtone of the usual thermally generated fundamental frequency.The effect is nonlinear in its dependence on the laser intensity; and is dependent on the timeof irradiation of the solution.

Detection of point mutation of p53 gene by non-isotopic PCR-SSCP in paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue,YH Chen; JP Dong; SJ Zhang,Abstract Non-isotopic PCR-SSCP method was used to detect point mutation of p53 gene inparaffin-embedded breast cancers. The abnormal shifting of the single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) was identified in 14 out of 60 cases. The point mutations of four cases were foundin exons 5-6; three in exon 7 and seven in exon 8. The mutant p53 protein was detected byimmunohistochemistry. The positive nuclear staining was observed in 13 cases; amongwhich 11 cases showed abnormal shifting of ssDNA in SSCP analysis. The point mutationsof the other two cases might occur in the regions which were not examined in this study. Thepoint mutations of p53 were found in 5 cases in the absence of detectable protein. Thisprobably resulted from the reduction or loss of antigenicity of p53 in some of the routinelyprocessed tissues.

Experimental investigation of transition boiling in forced convection,J Orozco; L Chen,RELATIVELY few studies have been formed on transi-tion boiling heat transfer incomparison to those on nucleate and film boiling. This is due in part to the difficultiesencountered in designing thermal systems to operate in this regime. Berenson; 1 makinguse of a copper block that was heated from below by the condensation of high-pressuresteam and cooled on top by the boiling of a low-pressure boiling fluid; measured the surfaceheat fluxes as a function of the temperature difference between the top of the copper blockand the saturated fluid. In his experiments; Berenson noted that the peak heat flux in poolboiling was slightly dependent upon the surface condition of the heater.

Epitaxial CoSi 2/Porous-Si Strained Layer Structres Grown by Mbe,YC Kao; D Jamieson; G Bai; CW Nieh; TL Lin; BJ Wu; HY Chen; KL Wang,Abstract CoSi 2 epitaxial layers with thickness ranging from 24 nm to 170 nm have beengrown onto porous Si substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. The X-ray rocking curves andtransmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to examine the strain relaxation andinterface quality. Backscattering with channeling is used to characterize the crystallinity ofthe epilayers. The results show that it is necessary to grow a thin buffer Si layer in order toimprove the interfacial sharpness and crystallinity of the epilayers; near perfect crystallinity isthen obtained as the thickness of the CoSi 2 films exceed 50 nm. TEM results reveal thatboth CoSi 2/Si and CoSi 2/porous-Si interfaces are flat and layer thickness is uniform. It isfound by TEM that the dislocation density of CoSi 2 grown on porous Si is much lower thanthat on single-crystal Si.

Toreduce the Miller capacitive coupling of the input and the output terminals during thetransient conditions; the terraced gate design has been implemented. As a result; the Millercapacitance is lowered 4–5 times compared to conventional gate design. Also; the gate padis placed at the centre of the pellet so that the intrinsic device turnon and turnoff times can beshorter. To prevent current crowding and thermal fatigue around a single emitter pad; amultiple emitter pad design scheme is adopted.

Investigations on the polarographic behaviour of rhenium in perchloric acid solutions,Hongyuan Chen; R Neeb,The polographic behaviour of rhenium (VII) was investigated in perchloric acid solutions ofhigher concentrations. For the polarographic determination of small concentrations ofrhenium (VII) a 10 M perchloric acid is properly suited. The determination can be performedby DC-; AC and DP-polarography. With DC-polarography 2 x 10-8 M Re (VII) can bedetected. The calibration curves are linear in the range from 5 x 10-8 to 6 x 10-5 M Re (VII).From investigations of the temperature-and droptime dependence the catalytic/kinetic originof the polarographic currents is made probable.(orig.),Fresenius' Zeitschrift fuer Analytische Chemie,1985,*

Error analysis of stochastic gradient descent ranking algorithm,Hong Chen; Yi Tang; Luoqing Li; Xuelong Li; Yuanyan Tang,Abstract Ranking is always an important task in machine learning and information retrieval;eg; collaborative filtering; recommender system; drug discovery; etc. A kernel-basedstochastic gradient descent algorithm with the least squares loss is proposed for ranking inthis paper. The implementation of this algorithm is simple; and an expression of the solutionis derived via sampling operator and integral operator. An explicit convergence rate forleaning a ranking function is given in terms of the suitable choices of the step size and theregularization parameter. The analysis technique used here is capacity independent and isnovel in error analysis of ranking learning. Experimental results on real-world data haveshown the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in ranking tasks; which verifies thetheoretical analysis in ranking error.,*,*,*

STRENGTH ANALYSIS OF 3D AXIAL BRAIDED COMPOSITES,GD Fang; J Liang; Z Chen; JB Xie,There are majority of failure mechanisms for composites. Therefore; it is recognized by manyscholars that the failure locus of anisotropic composites can be expressed by an unsmoothfunction. The failure envelope corresponding to the specific failure mode should beformulated by the independent functions. Hashin [1] has proposed the failure criteria oftransversely isotropic material which are controlled by the fiber and matrix failure modes.Rychlewski [2] has extended the Mises criteria to the anisotropic material. I Huber [3] hasproposed a limit condition based on the assumption that only a certain part of elastic strainenergy is responsible for the limit condition. Kowalczyk-Gajewska [4] has also developed theenergy-based limit criteria for anisotropic elastic materials with internal constraints whichinclude the restriction from the elastic region and limit state.

By using variance ratio analysis;they find insufficient evidence of a significant autocorrelation in stock prices. Additionally;they find the naive random walk model to be a better predictor of short-term price behaviorthan the autoregressive integrated moving average model. Consequently; a contrarianapplication of the trading rules produces consistently positive excess stock returns relative tothe buy-and-hold portfolio. Conventional application of the rules succeeds only duringrelatively rare trending periods.,*,*,*

An Efficient Data Gathering Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks with Single Mobile Sink,Jin Wang; Bo Tang; Yuhui Zheng; Jianwei Zhang; Jeong-Uk Kim,Abstract. In many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where sensors aredeployed in areas accessed by laid roads; sinks can be assembled on mobile devices likebus or handcart. Compare to WSNs with static sink (s); wireless Sensor Networks withMobile Sink (s)(MSSNs) are more dominant at energy economization; delay decrease andnetwork lifetime prolongation. In this paper; we propose a Global Best Path (GBP) datagathering algorithm based on wireless Sensor Networks with single Mobile Sink (GBP-MSSN). It aims at determining the best position for the single mobile sink and further usingglobal sensors' information to generate the best scheme to gather data from specified node.Generating of best scheme is conducted by GBP algorithm which can balance energyconsumption among whole sensor networks and further prolong the network lifetime …,*,*,*

Magnetic Resonance Image Classification via Over-Complete Independent Component Analysis and Active Support Vector Machines,CC Chen; JW Chai; HM Chen; TJ Li; YC Ouyang; CW Yang; SK Lee; CI Chang,ABSTRACT Independent component analysis (ICA) has recently received considerableinterest in applications of magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. However; the ICA usedfor MR image analysis is generally over4complete in the sense that the number of images isusually less than the number of signal sources to be blindly separated. As a result; morethan one brain tissue clusters may be separated and forced into a single independentcomponent (IC) so that these brain tissues substances present in a particular IC cannot bediscriminated one from another. In this paper; we proposed an over4complete ICA (OC4ICA)method in conjunction with spatial domain4based classification in order to achieve betterclassification in each single independent component (IC) as well as discrimination of braintissue substances.,*,*,*

A VHF Oscillator Design Based on BJT Active Load Differential Amplifier,Kwang-Jow Gan Lin; Pei-Hua Chang; Dong-Shong Liang; Yaw Hwang Chen,Abstract—In this paper; we present a VHF (Very High Frequency) band oscillator whichmainly composed of a BJT active load differential amplifier (Diff. amp). We use H-spice toverify that the active load differential amplifier oscillator output frequency is 900 MHz at 2.0volts power supply under CIC 0.18 um-Si process. We also use discrete devices on breadboard to prove the circuit is an oscillator circuit. Those experiments show such an oscillatorcan work stably from 3.8 to 5.9 volts. Their output frequency will be 161.1 MHz; 186.7 MHzunder 3.8 volts and 5.9 volts respectively.

In Vivo Monitoring the Circulation and the Gold Nanoparticles Uptake by High Resolution Synchrotron X-Ray Microscopy,Chia-Chi Chien; Chang-Hai Wang; Hung-Jen Wu; Wen-De Chang; Cheng-Feng Lee; Chi-Jen Liu; Cheng-Liang Wang; Yeu-Kuang Hwu; JH Je; G Margaritondo; X-ray Imaging Center,Nanoparticles found wild applications in medicine; the most highlighted was its applicationas drug delivery carriers. The surface of nanoparticels can be modified or conjugated withspecific antibodies or fluorescence dyes to identify proteins or label the tumor cells. Most ofthe imaging techniques; such as MicroCT (computed tomography) or PET (positron emissiontomography)(1); can only measure the distribution of nanoparticles in animal certain amountof time after injection. The temporal and spatial resolutions were greatly compromised andinsufficient to trace the circulation and deposition of nanoparticles in real time.(2) TheSynchrotron Radiation (SR) based microradiology we developed offers very higher temporaland spatial resolution (< 1 ms and< 1 µm)(3) and we demonstrate in this work that it is idealto study in vivo the circulation and accumulation of the gold nanoparticles.In addition to …,*,*,*

Achieve a New Type Frequency Divider Circuit and Application By MOS-HBT-NDR,YK LI; KJ Gan; CS Tsai; PH Chang; YH Chen,Abstract The conventional negative-differential-resistance (NDR) is fabricated by Ⅲ-Ⅴcompound material; such as GaAs and InP. It has the advantage of high electron mobility.However it is not very easy to integrate with other devices and circuits. In this paper; weproposed a new NDR device which is composed of metal-oxide-semiconductor-fieldeffect-transistor (MOS) devices. Because this NDR device is consisted of MOS and BJT devices;we call his novel NDR devices as MOS-BJT-NDR device. Because the current-voltage (IV)characteristic is N type. This NDR device is so called N-type HBT-NDR device. HBT-NDRdevices and their applications are fabricated by the CMOS or Bi-CMOS technique thatprovided by the national chip implementation center. We design the frequency divider usingHBT-NDR devices. This kind of the devices consists of a inductance; a capacitance and …,*,*,*
A VHF Oscillator Design Based on BJT Cascode Active Load Differential Amplifier,Cher-Shiung Tsai; Shu-Yin Jiang; Ming-Yuan Guo; Kwang-Jow Gan; Pei-Hua Chang,Abstract—In this paper; we present a VHF (Very High Frequency) band oscillator whichmainly composed of a BJT cascode active load differential amplifier (Diff. amp). We use H-spice to verify that the cascode active load differential amplifier oscillator output frequency is800 MHz at 2.5 volts power supply under CIC 0.18 um-Si process. We also use discretedevices on bread board to prove the circuit is an oscillator circuit. Those experiments showsuch an oscillator can work stably from 4.0 to 6.0 volts. Their output frequency will be 158.2MHz; 183.2 MHz under 4.0 volts and 6.0 volts respectively. We use FFT (Fast FourierTransform) diagram to analyze these oscillators and shows SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)values. Finally; those experimental results reveal that the oscillator is a nice voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO) and also have good SNR characteristics.,*,*,*
Structural Embeddedness as a Governance Device,Yi Guo; Limin Hou; Liang Chen; Zhen Tang,Abstract We reviewed the main criticism to TCE and then identified four types ofimprovements to TCE that represents four promising research directions. We chose in thisarticle to broaden the TCE's analysis perspective to network level through studying theinfluence of structural embeddedness of one specific exchange relationship on the dyadiclevel governance process. We proposed that structural embeddedness could serve as agovernance device in its own rights and moderate the three pairs of relationships that existbetween exchange hazards and dyadic level governance mechanisms; between dyadiclevel governance mechanisms and governance outcomes; and between contractgovernance and relational governance.

The predictiontechnique has been developed for several decades. The Chou-Fasman algorithm; one ofthe earliest methods; has been successfully applied to the prediction. However; this methodhas its limitations due to low accuracy; unreliable parameters; and over prediction. Thanks tothe recent development in protein folding type-specific structure propensities and wavelettransformation; the shortcomings in Chou-Fasman method are able to be overcome.RESULTS: We improved Chou-Fasman method in three aspects.(a) Replace the nucleationregions with extreme values of coefficients calculated by the continuous wavelettransform.(b) Substitute the original secondary structure conformational parameters with …,Detail:,*,*

Characterization of phonon softening in the TiSe2 charge density wave transition via x-ray scattering,M Holt; Z Wu; H Hong; P Zschack; P Jemian; J Tischler; H Chen; MY Chou; TC Chiang,Titanium diselenide crystallizes into a semimetallic layered structure typical of transition-metal dichalcogenides; whose preparation and physical properties are summarized in anexhaustive review article by Yoffe [1]. Upon cooling below about 200 K; TiSe2 undergoes astructural and electronic phase transition described by the formation of a commensurate real-space 2a× 2b× 2c superlattice with the resultant folding of reciprocal space [2; 3]. Thiselectronic phase transition can be described in terms of the softening of a transverse zoneboundary phonon at the L point (1/2; 0; 1/2) in the Brillouin zone [2–4]. The softening of thismode as a function of temperature through the phase transition is; as of yet; unobserved andshould yield information as to the order and character of the charge density wave (CDW)phase transition; the location of the basis atoms participating in the soft mode; and the …,*,*,*

Sinchrotron Studies of Single Crystal Lead Magnesium Niobate Under Applied Electric Field,A Tkachuk; L Basile; W Lui; E Colla; H Chen,Introduction: Lead PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 (PMN) is a ferroelectric relaxor material attractive tocapacitor and actuator industries; however better understanding of the microstructure is stillneeded for successful applications. Polar nano-regions of the rhombohedral phase weresuggested to be responsible for observed relaxor behavior and glass-like properties at lowtemperatures. In this work we take advantage of the high resolution synchrotron radiation tostudy the effects of the electric field on the formation of the rhombohedral phase tocomplement similar studies of PMN using conventional rotating anode x-ray sources [1; 2].Methods and Materials: A single crystal of PMN with a surface normal perpendicular to (111)planes was grown by the Bridgman technique [3]. The crystal had the linear dimensions5x7x0. 5 mm3. Dielectric measurements have confirmed relaxor behavior. Gold …,*,*,*
Synchrotron X-ray diffuse scattering studies of PMN-PT relaxor ferroelectrics,A Tkachuk; H Chen,Results: Fig. 1 shows distribution of the diffuse scattering intensity in the reciprocal spacenear (022) Bragg peak for several PMN-xPT compositions. Reflections marked F and α onthe plot are superlattice peaks at different Brillouine zone boundaries. Detailed analysis ofthe temperature dependence has shown that F peaks are primarily due to Nb/Mg chemicalordering; while α superlattice peaks have pure atomic displacement origin [2; 3]. Integratedintensity of the α peaks exhibited strong temperature dependence near phenomenologicalVogel-Fulcher freezing temperature obtained from macroscopic dielectric relaxationmeasurements for different chemical compositions [2; 3]. It was found that no superlatticereflections exist in PMN-0.32 PT; which is—normal ferroelectric “crystal. Studies of the αpeaks provide us with better understanding of the structure-property relationship in PMN …,*,*,*

促进弱势群体参与体育锻炼心理干预措施的实验研究――以残疾人为例,Qi SI; Hong-yu CHEN; Hai-qun LIU; Kang HUANG,摘要: 本研究随机抽取了322 名听障残疾学生为研究对象; 对《 阶段变化量表》 进行了修订和信;效度检验; 并在此基础上对听障残疾学生的锻炼现状和心理影响因素及其变化趋势进行了研究.研究结果表明:(1) 针对听障残疾学生修订的《 阶段变化量表》 信; 效度良好;(2)坚持规律性锻炼的听障残疾学生仅占被试的三成;(3) 经单因变量多因素方差分析; 锻炼收益(h 2=0.06); 自我效能(h 2= 0.11) 和变化过程(h 2= 0.15) 的均值随听障残疾学生所处锻炼阶段的上升呈现上升趋势; 但锻炼弊端却没有表现出此趋势. 这可能与锻炼弊端的构成;及其随研究对象的变化而发生变化的特性有关;(4) 所有心理因素对听障残疾学生所处锻炼阶段的正确判别率为35.1%;(5) 自我效能的高低对听障残疾学生所处锻炼行为阶段的影响不具有统计学意义; 这与前期众多研究结果相悖. 出现这一结果的原因可能是: 听障残疾学生对自身参与体育锻炼能力的认识不客观; 自我认同存在偏差. 本研究为阶段变化模型在残疾人这个特殊群体中 …,*,*,*

Factor Matrix Nuclear Norm Minimization for Low-Rank Tensor Completion,Yuanyuan Liu; Fanhua Shang; Hong Cheng; James Cheng; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Most existing low-n-rank minimization algorithms for tensor completion suffer fromhigh computational cost due to involving multiple singular value decompositions (SVDs) ateach iteration. To address this issue; we propose a novel factor matrix rank minimizationmethod for tensor completion problems. Based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)decomposition; we first formulate a factor matrix rank minimization model by deducing therelation between the rank of each factor matrix and the mode-n rank of a tensor. Then; weintroduce a tractable relaxation of our rank function; which leads to a convex combinationproblem of much smaller scale matrix nuclear norm minimization. Finally; we develop anefficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme to solve the proposedproblem. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data validate the …,*,*,*

Mining Rich Graphs: A Graph Transformation Approach,Didi Surian; David Lo; Hong Cheng; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract There have been a large number of studies mining graph patterns; however; mostof them only process graphs with nodes and edges having a single label. Often there is aneed to represent a rich dataset as graphs with nodes and edges having multiple labels-each label representing a feature in the dataset. For example; in a social network; multiplefeatures could be associated to individuals (eg; age; address; etc.) and their relationships(eg; friend; foe; send message; etc.). To analyze these rich datasets; there is a need toextend existing graph mining algorithms to also mine rich graphs with nodes and edgeshaving multiple labels. In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm and framework totransform richly labeled graphs (ie; graphs with nodes and edges having multiple labels) toan equivalent set of simple labeled graphs (ie; graphs with nodes and edges having …,*,*,*
