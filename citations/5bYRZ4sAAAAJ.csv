Privacy preserving association rule mining in vertically partitioned data,Jaideep Vaidya; Chris Clifton,Abstract Privacy considerations often constrain data mining projects. This paper addressesthe problem of association rule mining where transactions are distributed across sources.Each site holds some attributes of each transaction; and the sites wish to collaborate toidentify globally valid association rules. However; the sites must not reveal individualtransaction data. We present a two-party algorithm for efficiently discovering frequentitemsets with minimum support levels; without either site revealing individual transactionvalues.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,1181
Tools for privacy preserving distributed data mining,Chris Clifton; Murat Kantarcioglu; Jaideep Vaidya; Xiaodong Lin; Michael Y Zhu,Abstract Privacy preserving mining of distributed data has numerous applications. Eachapplication poses different constraints: What is meant by privacy; what are the desiredresults; how is the data distributed; what are the constraints on collaboration andcooperative computing; etc. We suggest that the solution to this is a toolkit of componentsthat can be combined for specific privacy-preserving data mining applications. This paperpresents some components of such a toolkit; and shows how they can be used to solveseveral privacy-preserving data mining problems.,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2002,969
Privacy-preserving k-means clustering over vertically partitioned data,Jaideep Vaidya; Chris Clifton,Abstract Privacy and security concerns can prevent sharing of data; derailing data miningprojects.

Each site learns the cluster of each entity; but learns nothing aboutthe attributes at other sites.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,687
The role mining problem: finding a minimal descriptive set of roles,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Qi Guo,Abstract Devising a complete and correct set of roles has been recognized as one of themost important and challenging tasks in implementing role based access control. A keyproblem related to this is the notion of goodness/interestingness--when is a rolegood/interesting? In this paper; we define the role mining problem (RMP) as the problem ofdiscovering an optimal set of roles from existing user permissions. The main contribution ofthis paper is to formally define RMP; and analyze its theoretical bounds. In addition to theabove basic RMP; we introduce two different variations of the RMP; called the δ-approxRMP and the Minimal Noise RMP that have pragmatic implications. We reduce the known"set basis problem" to RMP to show that RMP is an NP-complete problem. An importantcontribution of this paper is also to show the relation of the role mining problem to several …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2007,256
Privacy preserving data mining,Jaideep Vaidya; Christopher W Clifton; Yu Michael Zhu,Data mining has emerged as a significant technology for gaining knowledge from vastquantities of data. However; concerns are growing that use of this technology can violateindividual privacy. These concerns have led to a backlash against the technology; forexample; a" Data-Mining Moratorium Act" introduced in the US Senate that would havebanned all data-mining programs (including research and development) by the USDepartment of Defense. Privacy Preserving Data Mining provides a comprehensiveoverview of available approaches; techniques and open problems in privacy preservingdata mining. This book demonstrates how these approaches can achieve data mining; whileoperating within legal and commercial restrictions that forbid release of data. Furthermore;this research crystallizes much of the underlying foundation; and inspires further research …,*,2006,253
Secure set intersection cardinality with application to association rule mining,Jaideep Vaidya; Chris Clifton,Abstract There has been concern over the apparent conflict between privacy and datamining. There is no inherent conflict; as most types of data mining produce summary resultsthat do not reveal information about individuals. The process of data mining may use privatedata; leading to the potential for privacy breaches. Secure Multiparty Computation showsthat results can be produced without revealing the data used to generate them. The problemis that general techniques for secure multiparty computation do not scale to data-mining sizecomputations. This paper presents an efficient protocol for securely determining the size ofset intersection; and shows how this can be used to generate association rules wheremultiple parties have different (and private) information about the same set of individuals.,Journal of Computer Security,2005,204
Defining privacy for data mining,Chris Clifton; Murat Kantarcioglu; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract: Privacy preserving data mining–getting valid data mining results without learningthe underlying data values–has been receiving attention in the research community andbeyond. It is unclear what privacy preserving means.

RoleMiner: mining roles using subset enumeration,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Janice Warner,Abstract Role engineering; the task of defining roles and associating permissions to them; isessential to realize the full benefits of the role-based access control paradigm. Essentially;there are two basic approaches to accomplish this: the top-down and the bottom-up. The top-down approach relies on a careful analysis of the business processes to define job functionsand then specify appropriate roles from them. While this approach can aid in defining rolesmore accurately; it is tedious and time consuming since it requires that the semantics of thebusiness processes be well understood. Moreover; it ignores existing permissions within anorganization and does not utilize them. On the other hand; the bottom-up approach startswith existing permissions and attempts to derive roles from them; thus helping to automaterole definition. In this paper; we present an unsupervised approach called RoleMiner that …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2006,182

However; privacy and security concerns often preventsharing of data; thus derailing data mining projects. Recently; there has been growing focuson finding solutions to this problem. Several algorithms have been proposed that dodistributed knowledge discovery; while providing guarantees on the non-disclosure of data.Classification is an important data mining problem applicable in many diverse domains. Thegoal of classification is to build a model which can predict an attribute (binary attribute in thiswork) based on the rest of attributes.

Semantics-based automated service discovery,Aabhas V Paliwal; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Hui Xiong; Nabil Adam,A vast majority of web services exist without explicit associated semantic descriptions. As aresult many services that are relevant to a specific user service request may not beconsidered during service discovery. In this paper; we address the issue of web servicediscovery given nonexplicit service description semantics that match a specific servicerequest. Our approach to semantic-based web service discovery involves semantic-basedservice categorization and semantic enhancement of the service request. We propose asolution for achieving functional level service categorization based on an ontologyframework. Additionally; we utilize clustering for accurately classifying the web servicesbased on service functionality. The semantic-based categorization is performed offline at theuniversal description discovery and integration (UDDI). The semantic enhancement of the …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2012,139
Optimal boolean matrix decomposition: Application to role engineering,Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,A decomposition of a binary matrix into two matrices gives a set of basis vectors and theirappropriate combination to form the original matrix. Such decomposition solutions are usefulin a number of application domains including text mining; role engineering as well asknowledge discovery. While a binary matrix can be decomposed in several ways; however;certain decompositions better characterize the semantics associated with the original matrixin a succinct but comprehensive way. Indeed; one can find different decompositionsoptimizing different criteria matching various semantics. In this paper; we first present anumber of variants to the optimal Boolean matrix decomposition problem that havepragmatic implications. We then present a unified framework for modeling the optimal binarymatrix decomposition and its variants using binary integer programming. Such modeling …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Migrating to optimal RBAC with minimal perturbation,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Qi Guo; Nabil Adam,Abstract Devising a complete and correct set of roles has been recognized as one of themost important and challenging tasks in implementing role based access control. A keyproblem related to this is the notion of goodness-when is a set of roles good? Recently; therole mining problem (RMP) has been defined as the problem of discovering an optimal set ofroles from existing user permissions. Several different objectives for optimality have beenproposed. However; one problem with these definitions is that often organizations alreadyhave a deployed set of roles and wish to optimize this set. Even if an optimal set of roles isdiscovered; if this is widely different; it is impossible to simply throw out the deployed rolesand start using the new ones as this may disrupt organizational processes and separation ofduty constraints that are defined on roles.

Efficient privacy-preserving similar document detection,Mummoorthy Murugesan; Wei Jiang; Chris Clifton; Luo Si; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Similar document detection plays important roles in many applications; such as filemanagement; copyright protection; plagiarism prevention; and duplicate submissiondetection. The state of the art protocols assume that the contents of files stored on a server(or multiple servers) are directly accessible. However; this makes such protocols unsuitablefor any environment where the documents themselves are sensitive and cannot be openlyread. Essentially; this assumption limits more practical applications; eg; detectingplagiarized documents between two conferences; where submissions are confidential. Wepropose novel protocols to detect similar documents between two entities where documentscannot be openly shared with each other.

PRIVACY PRESERVING DATA MINING OVER,Jaideep Shrikant Vaidya,It is possible to efficiently extract or “mine” knowledge from large amounts of verticallypartitioned data within quantifiable security restrictions. Knowledge Discovery in Databases(KDD) is the term used to denote the process of extracting knowledge from large quantitiesof data. The KDD process assumes that all the data is easily accessible at a central locationor through centralized access mechanisms such as federated databases and virtualwarehouses. Moreover; advances in information technology and the ubiquity of networkedcomputers have made personal information much more available. Privacy advocates havebeen challenging attempts to bring more and more information into integrated collections.Attempts to combine data have even resulted in public protest; witness Japan's creation of anational registry containing information previously held by the prefectures [87].

An efficient approximate protocol for privacy-preserving association rule mining,Murat Kantarcioglu; Robert Nix; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract The secure scalar product (or dot product) is one of the most used sub-protocols inprivacy-preserving data mining. Indeed; the dot product is probably the most common sub-protocol used. As such; a lot of attention has been focused on coming up with secureprotocols for computing it. However; an inherent problem with these protocols is theextremely high computation cost–especially when the dot product needs to be carried outover large vectors. This is quite common in vertically partitioned data; and is a real problem.In this paper; we present ways to efficiently compute the approximate dot product. Weimplement the dot product protocol and demonstrate the quality of the approximation. Ourdot product protocol can be used to securely and efficiently compute association rules fromdata vertically partitioned between two parties.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2009,58
Privacy-preserving top-k queries,Jaideep Vaidya; Chris Clifton,The primary contribution of this paper is a secure method for doing top-k selection fromvertically partitioned data. This has particular relevance to privacy-sensitive searches; andmeshes well with privacy policies such as k-anonymity. We have demonstrated how secureprimitives from the literature can be composed with efficient query processing algorithms;with the result having provable security properties. The paper also shows a trade-offbetween efficiency and disclosure. It is worth exploring whether one could have a suite ofalgorithms to optimize these tradeoffs; eg; algorithms that guarantee k-anonymity withefficiency based on the choice of k rather than the guarantees of secure multipartycomputation.,Data Engineering; 2005.

Effective anonymization of query logs,Yuan Hong; Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Nabil Adam; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract User search query logs have proven to be very useful; but have vast potential formisuse. Several incidents have shown that simple removal of identifiers is insufficient toprotect the identity of users. Publishing such inadequately anonymized data can causesevere breach of privacy. While significant effort has been expended on coming up withanonymity models and techniques for microdata; there is little corresponding work for querylog data. Query logs are different in several important aspects; such as the diversity ofqueries and the causes of privacy breach. This necessitates the need to design privacymodels and techniques specific to this environment. This paper takes a first cut at tacklingthis challenge. Our main contribution is to define effective anonymization models for querylog data along with proposing techniques to achieve such anonymization.

Leveraging the multi in secure multi-party computation,Jaideep Vaidya; Chris Clifton,Abstract Secure Multi-Party Computation enables parties with private data to collaborativelycompute a global function of their private data; without revealing that data. The increase insensitive data on networked computers; along with improved ability to integrate and utilizethat data; make the time ripe for practical secure multi-party computation.

Privacy-preserving linear programming,Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract With the rapid increase in computing; storage and networking resources; data is notonly collected and stored; but also analyzed. This creates a serious privacy problem whichoften inhibits the use of this data. In this paper; we focus on the problem of linearprogramming; which is the most important sub-class of optimization problems. We considerthe case where the objective function and the constraints are partitioned between twoparties with one party holding the objective while the other holds the constraints. Wepropose a very efficient and secure transformation based solution that has the significantadded benefit of being independent of the specific linear programming algorithm used.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,2009,48
The role hierarchy mining problem: Discovery of optimal role hierarchies,Qi Guo; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Role hierarchies are fundamental to the role based access control (RBAC) model. Thenotion of role hierarchy is a well understood concept that allows senior roles to inherit thepermissions of the corresponding junior roles. Role hierarchies further ease the burden ofsecurity administration; as there is no need to explicitly specify and maintain a large numberof permissions. Given a set of roles or user permissions; one may construct a number ofalternative hierarchies. However; there does not exist the notion of an optimal role hierarchy.Optimality helps in maximizing the benefit of employing the role hierarchy. In this paper; wepropose such a formal metric. Our optimality notion is based on the smallest graphrepresentation of the role hierarchy (minimal in the number of edges) having the sametransitive closure as any alternate representation. We show why this makes sense as well …,Computer Security Applications Conference; 2008. ACSAC 2008. Annual,2008,47
A profile anonymization model for privacy in a personalized location based service environment,Heechang Shin; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Location based services (LBS) aim at delivering point of need information. Personalizationand customization of such services; based on the profiles of mobile users; would ignificantlyincrease the value of these services. Since profiles may include sensitive information ofmobile users and moreover can help identify a person; customization is allowed only whenthe security and privacy policies dictated by them are respected. While LBS are oftenpresumed as untrusted entities; the location services that capture and maintain mobile users'location to enable communication are considered trusted; and therefore can capture andmanage the profile information. In this paper; we address the problem of privacypreservation via anonymization. Prior research in this area attempts to ensure k-anonymityby generalizing the location. However; a person may still be identified based on his/her …,Mobile Data Management; 2008. MDM'08. 9th International Conference on,2008,47

An architecture for privacy-preserving mining of client information,Murat Kantarcioglu; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Due to privacy concerns; clients of some services may not want to reveal theirprivate information. Even in these situations; data mining is feasible without sacrificing userprivacy. Prior approaches to this problem generally trade off accuracy for security; withoutgiving provable bounds on security. Alternatives to the randomization technique arerequired to enable accurate data mining while strictly preserving privacy. In this paper; wepresent a general architecture that enables privacy-preserving mining of client information.Under some reasonable assumptions; we show that our methods are secure; whilemaintaining the accuracy of the results.,Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on Privacy; security and data mining-Volume 14,2002,45
Using semantics for automatic enforcement of access control policies among dynamic coalitions,Janice Warner; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Ravi Mukkamala; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract In a dynamic coalition environment; organizations should be able to exercise theirown local fine-grained access control policies while sharing resources with external entities.In this paper; we propose an approach that exploits the semantics associated with subjectand object attributes to facilitate automatic enforcement of organizational access controlpolicies while resource sharing occurs among coalition members. Our approach relies onidentifying the necessary attributes required by external users to gain access to a specificorganizational object (or service). Specifically; it consists of extracting user attribute sets thatsemantically match with the attributes of the objects for which a role has permissions. Thisrelies on a closer examination of why a user is assigned a specific role. These attribute setsare first pruned based on their significance in characterizing a role; which are then …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2007,42
An approach to securely identifying beneficial collaboration in decentralized logistics systems,Chris Clifton; Ananth Iyer; Richard Cho; Wei Jiang; Murat Kantarcıoğlu; Jaideep Vaidya,The problem of sharing manufacturing; inventory; or capacity to improve performance isapplicable in many decentralized operational contexts. However; the solution of suchproblems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information securityconcerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniquesto attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach; we focus ona problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up anddelivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-enhancing task swaps while limitingthe information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that findsopportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped;along with proofs of the security of the protocol.

Constraint-aware role mining via extended boolean matrix decomposition,Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Yuan Hong,The role mining problem has received considerable attention recently. Among the manysolutions proposed; the Boolean matrix decomposition (BMD) formulation has stood out;which essentially discovers roles by decomposing the binary matrix representing user-to-permission assignment (UPA) into two matrices-user-to-role assignment (UA) andpermission-to-role assignment (PA). However; supporting certain embedded constraints;such as separation of duty (SoD) and exceptions; is critical to the role mining process.Otherwise; the mined roles may not capture the inherent constraints of the access controlpolicies of the organization. None of the previously proposed role mining solutions;including BMD; take into account these underlying constraints while mining. In this paper;we extend the BMD so that it reflects such embedded constraints by proposing to allow …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2012,36
A random decision tree framework for privacy-preserving data mining,Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Wei Fan; Danish Mehmood; David Lorenzi,Distributed data is ubiquitous in modern information driven applications. With multiplesources of data; the natural challenge is to determine how to collaborate effectively acrossproprietary organizational boundaries while maximizing the utility of collected information.Since using only local data gives suboptimal utility; techniques for privacy-preservingcollaborative knowledge discovery must be developed. Existing cryptography-based workfor privacy-preserving data mining is still too slow to be effective for large scale data sets toface today's big data challenge. Previous work on random decision trees (RDT) shows that itis possible to generate equivalent and accurate models with much smaller cost.

Enhancing the government service experience through QR codes on mobile platforms,David Lorenzi; Jaideep Vaidya; Soon Chun; Basit Shafiq; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Digital government is universally gaining acceptance as the public becomes moretechnologically advanced. It is critical for the government to embrace new technology forminimizing costs and maximizing utility of services to the taxpayers. While administrativeservices have been easily ported to the digital world; there are still many important citizen-centric services that have not yet been effectively migrated. Quick Response codes (QRcodes) provide a means to effectively distribute many different varieties of information to thepublic. We propose to integrate QR code systems and corresponding smartphoneapplications into existing government services with the goal of providing a new level ofinteractivity for the public. We illustrate this through two case studies; examining the NationalPark Services and the Mobile Environmental Information Services (MENVIS). The focus is …,Government Information Quarterly,2014,34
Role engineering via prioritized subset enumeration,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Janice Warner; Qi Guo,Today; role-based access control (RBAC) has become a well-accepted paradigm forimplementing access control because of its convenience and ease of administration.However; in order to realize the full benefits of the RBAC paradigm; one must first define theroles accurately. This task of defining roles and associating permissions with them; alsoknown as role engineering; is typically accomplished either in a top-down or in a bottom-upmanner. Under the top-down approach; a careful analysis of the business processes is doneto first define job functions and then to specify appropriate roles from them.

Differentially private naive bayes classification,Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Anirban Basu; Yuan Hong,Abstract Privacy and security concerns often prevent the sharing of users' data or even of theknowledge gained from it; thus deterring valuable information from being utilized. Privacy-preserving knowledge discovery; if done correctly; can alleviate this problem. One of themost important and widely used data mining techniques is that of classification. We considerthe model where a single provider has centralized access to a dataset and would like torelease a classifier while protecting privacy to the best extent possible. Recently; the modelof differential privacy has been developed which provides a strong privacy guarantee even ifadversaries hold arbitrary prior knowledge. In this paper; we apply this rigorous privacymodel to develop a Naive Bayes classifier; which is often used as a baseline andconsistently provides reasonable classification performance.

Preserving privacy in social networks: A structure-aware approach,Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam; Vijay Atluri,Graph structured data can be ubiquitously found in the real world. For example; socialnetworks can easily be represented as graphs where the graph connotes the complex setsof relationships between members of social systems. While their analysis could be beneficialin many aspects; publishing certain types of social networks raises significant privacyconcerns. This brings the problem of graph anonymization into sharp focus. Unlike relationaldata; the true information in graph structured data is encoded within the structure and graphproperties. Motivated by this; we propose a structure aware anonymization approach thatmaximally preserves the structure of the original network as well as its structural propertieswhile anonymizing it. Instead of anonymizing each node one by one independently; ourapproach treats each partitioned substructural component of the network as one single …,Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technologies; 2009.

Anonymizing set-valued data by nonreciprocal recoding,Mingqiang Xue; Panagiotis Karras; Chedy Raïssi; Jaideep Vaidya; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Today there is a strong interest in publishing set-valued data in a privacy-preserving manner. Such data associate individuals to sets of values (eg; preferences;shopping items; symptoms; query logs). In addition; an individual can be associated with asensitive label (eg; marital status; religious or political conviction). Anonymizing such dataimplies ensuring that an adversary should not be able to (1) identify an individual's record;and (2) infer a sensitive label; if such exists. Existing research on this problem eitherperturbs the data; publishes them in disjoint groups disassociated from their sensitive labels;or generalizes their values by assuming the availability of a generalization hierarchy. In thispaper; we propose a novel alternative.

However; storing and analyzing search logs can be very useful for many purposes(ie investigating human behavior). Thus; an important research question is how to privatelysanitize search logs. Several search log anonymization techniques have been proposedwith concrete privacy models. However; in all of these solutions; the output utility of thetechniques is only evaluated rather than being maximized in any fashion. Indeed; foreffective search log anonymization; it is desirable to derive the outputs with optimal utilitywhile meeting the privacy standard. In this paper; we propose utility-maximizing sanitizationbased on the rigorous privacy standard of differential privacy; in the context of search logs.Specifically; we utilize optimization models to maximize the output utility of the sanitization …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,29
Secure and efficient distributed linear programming,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Haibing Lu,Abstract In today's networked world; resource providers and consumers are distributedglobally and locally; especially under current cloud computing environment. However; withresource constraints; optimization is necessary to ensure the best possible usage of suchscarce resources. Distributed linear programming (DisLP) problems allow collaborativeagents to jointly maximize profits or minimize costs with a linear objective function whileconforming to several shared as well as local linear constraints. Since each agent's share ofthe global constraints and the local constraints generally refer to its private limitations orcapacities; serious privacy problems may arise if such information is revealed. While therehave been some solutions raised that allow secure computation of such problems; theytypically rely on inefficient protocols with enormous computation and communication cost.,Journal of Computer Security,2012,29
A secure revised simplex algorithm for privacy-preserving linear programming,Jaideep Vaidya,Linear programming is one of the most widely applied solutions to optimization problems.This paper presents a privacy-preserving solution to linear programming for two partieswhen the cost; or objective; function is known only to one party; and the constraint equationsare known only to the other party. An algorithm based on Revised Simplex is given thatensures that neither party gains access to the other's private information. While this hasbeen proposed before; our solution is significantly more efficient for the given datadistribution. This enables collaboration among companies in many domains; enhancingefficiency while maintaining competitiveness.,Advanced Information Networking and Applications; 2009. AINA'09.

Privacy-preserving indexing of documents on the network,Mayank Bawa; Roberto J Bayardo Jr; Rakesh Agrawal; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract With the ubiquitous collection of data and creation of large distributed repositories;enabling search over this data while respecting access control is critical. A related problemis that of ensuring privacy of the content owners while still maintaining an efficient index ofdistributed content. We address the problem of providing privacy-preserving search overdistributed access-controlled content. Indexed documents can be easily reconstructed fromconventional (inverted) indexes used in search. Currently; the need to avoid breaches ofaccess-control through the index requires the index hosting site to be fully secured andtrusted by all participating content providers. This level of trust is impractical in theincreasingly common case where multiple competing organizations or individuals wish toselectively share content. We propose a solution that eliminates the need of such a …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,28
Efficient Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering Based on the Weighted Slope One Predictor.,Anirban Basu; Jaideep Vaidya; Hiroaki Kikuchi,Abstract Rating-based collaborative filtering (CF) predicts the rating that a user will give toan item; derived from the ratings of other items given by other users. Such CF schemesutilise either user neighbourhoods (ie user-based CF) or item neighbourhoods (ie item-based CF). Lemire and MacLachlan [19] proposed three related schemes for an item-basedCF with predictors of the form f (x)= x+b; hence the name “slope one”. Slope One predictorshave been shown to be accurate on large datasets. They also have several other desirableproperties such as being updatable on the fly; efficient to compute; and work even withsparse input.

Privacy-preserving kth element score over vertically partitioned data,Jaideep Vaidya; Christopher W Clifton,Given a large integer data set shared vertically by two parties; we consider the problem ofsecurely computing a score separating the kth and the (k+ 1) to compute such a score whilerevealing little additional information.

Collaborative search log sanitization: Toward differential privacy and boosted utility,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Haibing Lu; Panagiotis Karras; Sanjay Goel,Severe privacy leakage in the AOL search log incident has attracted considerable worldwideattention. However; all the web users' daily search intents and behavior are collected in suchdata; which can be invaluable for researchers; data analysts and law enforcement personnelto conduct social behavior study [14]; criminal investigation [5] and epidemics detection [10].Thus; an important and challenging research problem is how to sanitize search logs withstrong privacy guarantee and sufficiently retained utility. Existing approaches in search logsanitization are capable of only protecting the privacy under a rigorous standard [24] ormaintaining good output utility [25]. To the best of our knowledge; there is little work that hasperfectly resolved such tradeoff in the context of search logs; meeting a high standard ofboth requirements.

Analyzing temporal role based access control models,Emre Uzun; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Gennaro Parlato; Anna Lisa Ferrara; Madhusudan Parthasarathy,Abstract Today; Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is the de facto model used for advancedaccess control; and is widely deployed in diverse enterprises of all sizes. Several extensionsto the authorization as well as the administrative models for RBAC have been adopted inrecent years. In this paper; we consider the temporal extension of RBAC (TRBAC); anddevelop safety analysis techniques for it. Safety analysis is essential for understanding theimplications of security policies both at the stage of specification and modification. Towardsthis end; in this paper; we first define an administrative model for TRBAC. Our strategy forperforming safety analysis is to appropriately decompose the TRBAC analysis problem intomultiple subproblems similar to RBAC. Along with making the analysis simpler; this enablesus to leverage and adapt existing analysis techniques developed for traditional RBAC …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2012,25

Edge-RMP: Minimizing administrative assignments for role-based access control,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Qi Guo; Haibing Lu,Abstract Because of its ease of administration; role-based access control (RBAC) hasbecome the norm to enforcing security in most of today's organizations. For implementingRBAC; it is important to devise a complete and correct set of roles. This task; known as roleengineering; has been identified as one of the costliest components in deploying RBAC. Akey problem with respect to role engineering is that there is no formal metric for measuringthe goodness/interestingness of the devised set of roles. Recently; Vaidya et al.[26]; formallydefine the role mining problem (RMP) as the problem of discovering an optimal set of rolesfrom existing user permissions; and analyze its theoretical bounds. Essentially; given a user-permission assignment (UPA); the basic RMP is to discover the user-role assignmentrelation (UA) and role-permission assignment relation (PA) such that the number of roles …,Journal of Computer Security,2009,25
A survey of privacy-preserving methods across vertically partitioned data,Jaideep Vaidya,The goal of data mining is to extract or “mine” knowledge from large amounts of data.However; data is often collected by several different sites. Privacy; legal and commercialconcerns restrict centralized access to this data; thus derailing data mining projects.Recently; there has been growing focus on finding solutions to this problem. Severalalgorithms have been proposed that do distributed knowledge discovery; while providingguarantees on the non-disclosure of data. Vertical partitioning of data is an important datadistribution model often found in real life. Vertical partitioning or heterogeneous distributionimplies that different features of the same set of data are collected by different sites. In thischapter we survey some of the methods developed in the literature to mine verticallypartitioned data without violating privacy and discuss challenges and complexities …,*,2008,24
Knowledge discovery from transportation network data,Wei Jiang; Jaideep Vaidya; Zahir Balaporia; Chris Clifton; Brett Banich,Transportation and logistics are a major sector of the economy; however data analysis in thisdomain has remained largely in the province of optimization. The potential of data miningand knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped. Transportation networks arenaturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining oftransportation network graphs: we hope to find how current techniques both succeed and failon this problem; and from the failures; we hope to present new challenges for data mining.Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data miningtechniques to real transportation network data are provided; including new approaches tomaking these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are notappropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Secure information sharing and analysis for effective emergency management,Nabil R Adam; Vijay Atluri; Soon Chun; John Ellenberger; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Hui Xiong,Abstract Effective incident management and response requires timely and coordinateddecision making. 9/11; Katrina and other emergent events demonstrate the need for effectiveinformation sharing and decision support at the operational as well as at the strategic levels.There has been significant work on emergency response at the first-responder level. Thispaper addresses the challenge of integrating; aggregating and securely sharing informationto support situation awareness and response at the strategic level. Drawing on data fromvarious autonomous systems; the system uses context-sensitive parameters to filter;integrate; and effectively visualize information necessary to get a common operationalpicture.

Ensuring privacy and security for LBS through trajectory partitioning,Heechang Shin; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Sungyong Choi,The concept of location k-anonymity has been proposed to address the privacy issue oflocation based services (LBS). Under this notion of anonymity; the adversary only has theknowledge that the LBS request originates from a region containing at least k people; andtherefore cannot individually distinguish the requestor. However; new types of LBS servicessuch as continuous nearest neighbor searches require the knowledge of the user'strajectory; which can lead to a privacy breach. The longer the adversary can track the user'strajectory; the stronger the possibility that the user's sensitive information is revealed. Toalleviate this problem; we propose algorithms to optimally partition a continuous request intomultiple LBS requests with shorter trajectories. This results in increased privacy due to theunlinking of different requests over time and has the added benefit of improving the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,22
Role mining under role-usage cardinality constraint,John C John; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep S Vaidya,Abstract With the emergence of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) as the de facto accesscontrol model; organizations can now implement and manage many high level securitypolicies. As a means of migration from traditional access control systems to RBAC; differentrole mining algorithms have been proposed in recent years for finding a minimal set of rolesfrom existing user-permission assignments. While determining such roles; it is often requiredthat certain security objectives are satisfied. A common goal is to enforce the role-usagecardinality constraint; which limits the maximum number of roles any user can have. In thispaper; we propose two alternative approaches for role mining with an upper bound on thenumber of roles that can be assigned to each user; and validate their performance withbenchmark data sets.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2012,21
Extended boolean matrix decomposition,Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Yuan Hong,With the vast increase in collection and storage of data; the problem of data summarizationis most critical for effective data management. Since much of this data is categorical innature; it can be viewed in terms of a Boolean matrix. Boolean matrix decomposition (BMD)has been used to provide concise and interpretable representations of Boolean data sets. ABoolean matrix can be expressed as a product of two Boolean matrices; where the firstmatrix represents a set of meaningful concepts; and the second describes how the observeddata can be expressed as combinations of those concepts. Typically; the combination is onlyin terms of the set union. In other words; a successful Boolean matrix decomposition gives aset of concepts and shows how every column of the input data can be expressed as a unionof some subset of those concepts. However; this way of modeling only incompletely …,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09. Ninth IEEE International Conference on,2009,19
Role engineering: from theory to practice,Nino Vincenzo Verde; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijay Atluri; Alessandro Colantonio,Abstract Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is the de facto standard in access controlmodels; and is widely used in many applications and organizations of all sizes. However;the task of finding an appropriate set of roles; called role engineering; remains the mostchallenging roadblock to effective deployment. In recent years; this problem has attracted alot of attention; with several bottom-up approaches being proposed; under the field of rolemining. However; most of these theoretical approaches cannot be directly applied to largescale datasets; which is where they are most necessary. Therefore; in this paper; we look athow to make role mining practical and usable for actual deployment. We propose a six stepsmethodology that makes role mining scalable without sacrificing on utility and is agnostic tothe actual role mining technique used.

Spatial neighborhood based anomaly detection in sensor datasets,Vandana P Janeja; Nabil R Adam; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Success of anomaly detection; similar to other spatial data mining techniques; relieson neighborhood definition. In this paper; we argue that the anomalous behavior of spatialobjects in a neighborhood can be truly captured when both (a) spatial autocorrelation(similar behavior of nearby objects due to proximity) and (b) spatial heterogeneity (distinctbehavior of nearby objects due to difference in the underlying processes in the region) aretaken into consideration for the neighborhood definition. Our approach begins by generatingmicro neighborhoods around spatial objects encompassing all the information about aspatial object. We selectively merge these based on spatial relationships accounting forautocorrelation and inferential relationships accounting for heterogeneity; forming macroneighborhoods. In such neighborhoods; we then identify (i) spatio-temporal outliers …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2010,18
Detecting inappropriate access to electronic health records using collaborative filtering,Aditya Krishna Menon; Xiaoqian Jiang; Jihoon Kim; Jaideep Vaidya; Lucila Ohno-Machado,Abstract Many healthcare facilities enforce security on their electronic health records (EHRs)through a corrective mechanism: some staff nominally have almost unrestricted access tothe records; but there is a strict ex post facto audit process for inappropriate accesses; ie;accesses that violate the facility's security and privacy policies. This process is inefficient; aseach suspicious access has to be reviewed by a security expert; and is purely retrospective;as it occurs after damage may have been incurred. This motivates automated approachesbased on machine learning using historical data. Previous attempts at such a system havesuccessfully applied supervised learning models to this end; such as SVMs and logisticregression. While providing benefits over manual auditing; these approaches ignore theidentity of the users and patients involved in a record access. Therefore; they cannot …,Machine learning,2014,17
An inference–proof approach to privacy-preserving horizontally partitioned linear programs,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Mangasarian (Optim. Lett.; 6 (3); 431–436; 2012) proposed a constraintstransformation based approach to securely solving the horizontally partitioned linearprograms among multiple entities—every entity holds its own private equality constraints.More recently; Li et al.(Optim. Lett.; doi: 10.1007/s11590-011-0403-2; 2012) extended thetransformation approach to horizontally partitioned linear programs with inequalityconstraints. However; such transformation approach is not sufficiently secure–occasionally;the privately owned constraints are still under high risk of inference. In this paper; we presentan inference–proof algorithm to enhance the security for privacy-preserving horizontallypartitioned linear program with arbitrary number of equality and inequality constraints.

Perturbation based privacy preserving Slope One predictors for collaborative filtering,Anirban Basu; Jaideep Vaidya; Hiroaki Kikuchi,Abstract The prediction of the rating that a user is likely to give to an item; can be derivedfrom the ratings of other items given by other users; through collaborative filtering (CF).However; CF raises concerns about the privacy of the individual user's rating data. To dealwith this; several privacy-preserving CF schemes have been proposed. However; they areall limited either in terms of efficiency or privacy when deployed on the cloud. Due to itssimplicity; Lemire and MacLachlan's weighted Slope One predictor is very well suited to thecloud. Our key insight is that; the Slope One predictor; being an invertible affinetransformation; is robust to certain types of noise. We exploit this fact to propose a randomperturbation based privacy preserving collaborative filtering scheme. Our evaluation showsthat the proposed scheme is both efficient and preserves privacy.,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2012,17
A profile anonymization model for location-based services,Heechang Shin; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Location-based services (LBS) aim at delivering point of need information.Personalization and customization of such services; based on the profiles of mobile users;would significantly increase the value of such services. Since profiles may include sensitiveinformation of mobile users and moreover can help identify a person; such customization isallowable only when the security and privacy policies dictated by them are respected. WhileLBS providers are presumed to be untrusted entities; the location services that capture andmaintain mobile users' location to enable communication are considered trusted; andtherefore can capture and manage the profile information. The question then is; how toenable the use of location based services while protecting privacy?,Journal of Computer Security,2011,17
Privacy preserving collaborative filtering for SaaS enabling PaaS clouds,Anirban Basu; Jaideep Vaidya; Hiroaki Kikuchi; Theo Dimitrakos; Srijith K Nair,Abstract Abstract Recommender systems use; amongst others; a mechanism calledcollaborative filtering (CF) to predict the rating that a user will give to an item given theratings of other items provided by other users. While reasonably accurate CF can beachieved with various well-known techniques; preserving the privacy of rating data fromindividual users poses a significant challenge.

Efficient security policy enforcement for the mobile environment,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Heechang Shin; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract In the last decade; mobile communication has enjoyed unprecedented growth allover the world. The recent advances in mobile communication technologies includingGlobal Positioning System (GPS) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have propelledthe growth of a number of mobile services. Typically; these require maintaining the mobileobjects' location and profile information and efficiently serving access requests on the past;present and future status of the moving objects. This creates inherent security and privacychallenges. One solution to this is to specify security policies to ensure controlled access.However; this significantly degrades system performance. To alleviate this; Atluri and Guohave proposed an unified index structure; S TPR-tree; to organize both the moving objectsand authorizations specified over them. A significant limitation of this approach is that it is …,Journal of Computer Security,2008,16

Weighted rank-one binary matrix factorization,Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Heechang Shin; Lili Jiang,Abstract Mining discrete patterns in binary data is important for many data analysis tasks;such as data sampling; compression; and clustering. An example is that replacing individualrecords with their patterns would greatly reduce data size and simplify subsequent dataanalysis tasks. As a straightforward approach; rank-one binary matrix approximation hasbeen actively studied recently for mining discrete patterns from binary data. It factorizes abinary matrix into the multiplication of one binary pattern vector and one binary presencevector; while minimizing mismatching entries. However; this approach suffers from twoserious problems. First; if all records are replaced with their respective patterns; the noisecould make as much as 50% in the resulting approximate data. This is because theapproach simply assumes that a pattern is present in a record as long as their matching …,*,2011,15
Meeting cardinality constraints in role mining,Pullamsetty Harika; Marreddy Nagajyothi; John C John; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Role mining is a critical step for organizations that migrate from traditional access controlmechanisms to role based access control (RBAC). Additional constraints may be imposedwhile generating roles from a given user-permission assignment relation. In this paper weconsider two such constraints which are the dual of each other. A role-usage cardinalityconstraint limits the maximum number of roles any user can have. Its dual; the permission-distribution cardinality constraint; limits the maximum number of roles to which a permissioncan belong. These two constraints impose mutually contradictory requirements on user torole and role to permission assignments. An attempt to satisfy one of the constraints mayresult in a violation of the other. We show that the constrained role mining problem is NP-Complete and present heuristic solutions. Two distinct frameworks are presented in this …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2015,14
Private searching on streaming data based on keyword frequency,Xun Yi; Elisa Bertino; Jaideep Vaidya; Chaoping Xing,Private searching on streaming data is a process to dispatch to a public server a program;which searches streaming sources of data without revealing searching criteria and thensends back a buffer containing the findings. From an Abelian group homomorphicencryption; the searching criteria can be constructed by only simple combinations ofkeywords; for example; disjunction of keywords. The recent breakthrough in fullyhomomorphic encryption has allowed us to construct arbitrary searching criteriatheoretically. In this paper; we consider a new private query; which searches for documentsfrom streaming data on the basis of keyword frequency; such that the frequency of a keywordis required to be higher or lower than a given threshold. This form of query can help us infinding more relevant documents. Based on the state of the art fully homomorphic …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2014,14

However; doing thiswhile preserving the privacy of rating data from individual users is a significant challenge.Several privacy preserving schemes have; so far been proposed in prior work. However;while these schemes are theoretically feasible; there are many practical implementationdifficulties on real world public cloud computing platforms.

Efficient integrity verification for outsourced collaborative filtering,Jaideep Vaidya; Ibrahim Yakut; Anirban Basu,Collaborative filtering (CF) over large datasets requires significant computing power. Due tothis data owning organizations often outsource the computation of CF (including someabstraction of the data itself) to a public cloud infrastructure. However; this leads to thequestion of how to verify the integrity of the outsourced computation. In this paper; wedevelop verification mechanisms for two popular item based collaborative filteringtechniques. We further analyze the cheating behavior of the cloud from the game-theoreticperspective. Coupled with the right incentives; we can ensure that the computation isincentive compatible thus ensuring that a rational adversary will not cheat. Leveraging this;we can develop efficient and effective mechanisms to address the problem of integrity inoutsourcing.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,12
Privacy-preserving collaborative filtering on the cloud and practical implementation experiences,Anirban Basu; Jaideep Vaidya; Hiroaki Kikuchi; Theo Dimitrakos,Recommender systems typically use collaborative filtering to make sense of huge andgrowing volumes of data. An emerging trend in industry has been to use public clouds todeal with the computing and storage requirements of such systems. This; however; comes ata price--data privacy. Simply ensuring communication privacy does not protect againstinsider threats or even attacks agagainst the cloud infrastructure itself. To deal with this;several privacy-preserving collaborative filtering algorithms have been developed in priorresearch. However; these have only been theoretically analyzed for the most part.

Privacy-preserving tabu search for distributed graph coloring,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Haibing Lu; Basit Shafiq,Combinatorial optimization is a fundamental problem found in many fields. In many real lifesituations; the constraints and the objective function forming the optimization problem arenaturally distributed amongst different sites in some fashion. The typical approach is tocollect all of this information together and centrally solve the problem. However; this requiresall parties to completely share their information; which may lead to serious privacy issues.Privacy-preserving techniques need to be developed to enable distributed optimization withlimited information disclosure. A further complicating factor is that combinatorial optimizationproblems are typically NP-hard; requiring approximation algorithms or heuristics to provide apractical solution. In this paper; we focus on a very well known hard problem-the distributedgraph coloring problem; which has been utilized to model many practical problems in …,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT) and 2011 IEEE Third Inernational Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom); 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on,2011,12
Search engine query clustering using top-k search results,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Haibing Lu,Abstract Clustering of search engine queries has attracted significant attention in recentyears. Many search engine applications such as query recommendation require queryclustering as a pre-requisite to function properly. Indeed; clustering is necessary to unlockthe true value of query logs. However; clustering search queries effectively is quitechallenging; due to the high diversity and arbitrary input by users. Search queries areusually short and ambiguous in terms of user requirements. Many different queries may referto a single concept; while a single query may cover many concepts. Existing prevalentclustering methods; such as K-Means or DBSCAN cannot assure good results in such adiverse environment. Agglomerative clustering gives good results but is computationallyquite expensive.

Role mining in the presence of noise,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Qi Guo; Haibing Lu,Abstract The problem of role mining; a bottom-up process of discovering roles from the user-permission assignments (UPA); has drawn increasing attention in recent years. The rolemining problem (RMP) and several of its variants have been proposed in the literature.While the basic RMP discovers roles that exactly represent the UPA; the inexact variants;such as the δ-approx RMP and MinNoise-RMP; allow for some inexactness in the sense thatthe discovered roles do not have to exactly cover the entire UPA. However; since data in reallife is never completely clean; the role mining process is only effective if it is robust to noise.This paper takes the first step towards addressing this issue. Our goal in this paper is toexamine if the effect of noise in the UPA could be ameliorated due to the inexactness in therole mining process; thus having little negative impact on the discovered roles …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,12
Privacy-preserving data mining,Chris Clifton; M Kantarcıoğlu; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract The growth of data mining has raised concerns among privacy advocates. Some ofthis is based on a misunderstanding of what data mining does. The previous chapters haveshown how data mining concentrates on extraction of rules; patterns and other suchsummary knowledge from large data sets. This would not seem to inherently violate privacy;which is generally concerned with the release of individual data values rather thansummaries.,*,2005,12
Toward mining of temporal roles,Barsha Mitra; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); users acquire permissions through theirassigned roles. Role mining; the process of finding a set of roles from direct user-permissionassignments; is essential for successful implementation of RBAC. In many organizations it isoften required that users are given permissions that can vary with time. To handle suchrequirements; temporal extensions of RBAC like Temporal-RBAC (TRBAC) and GeneralizedTemporal Role-Based Access Control (GTRBAC) have been proposed. Existing role miningtechniques; however; cannot be used to process the temporal element associated with rolesin these models. In this paper; we propose a method for mining roles in the context ofTRBAC. First we formally define the Temporal Role Mining Problem (TRMP); and then showthat the TRMP problem is NP-complete and present a heuristic approach for solving it.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2013,11
An optimization model for the extended role mining problem,Emre Uzun; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract The primary purpose of Role Mining is to effectively determine the roles in anenterprise using the permissions that have already been assigned to the users. If thispermission assignment is viewed as a 0-1 matrix; then Role Mining aims to decompose thismatrix into two matrices which represent user-role and role-permission assignments. Thisdecomposition is known as Boolean Matrix Decomposition (BMD). In this paper; we use anExtended BMD (EBMD) to consider separation of duty constraints (SOD) and exceptions;that are common to any security system; in the role mining process. Essentially; in EBMD; weintroduce negative assignments. An additional benefit of allowing negative assignments inroles is that; a less number of roles can be used to reconstruct the same given user-permission assignments. We introduce Extended Role Mining Problem and its variants …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2011,11
Privacy preserving integration of health care data,Nabil Adam; Tom White; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Xiaoyun He,Abstract For health care related research studies the medical records of patients may needto be retrieved from multiple sites with different regulations on the disclosure of healthinformation. Given the sensitive nature of health care information; privacy is a major concernwhen patients' health care data is used for research purposes. In this paper; we propose anapproach for integration and querying of health care data from multiple sources in a secureand privacy preserving manner.,AMIA Annual Symposium proceedings,2007,11
An optimization framework for role mining,Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is accepted as the de facto access controlmodel for organizations of all sizes. However; engineering the right set of roles is crucial toenable the correct deployment of RBAC within an organization. Indeed; discovering anoptimal and correct set of roles from existing permission assignments; referred to as the rolemining problem (RMP); has gained significant attention in recent years. Role Mining is itselfan instantiation of Boolean matrix decomposition–wherein a Boolean matrix is decomposedinto two Boolean matrices giving a set of basis vectors and their appropriate combination. Infact; such decompositions are useful in a number of application domains beyond roleengineering; including text mining as well as knowledge discovery. While a Boolean matrixcan be decomposed in many ways; however; certain decompositions better characterize …,Journal of Computer Security,2014,10
UICDS compliant resource management system for emergency response,Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijay Atluri; Soon Chun,Abstract The essential components of effective emergency management and responseinclude pertinent information sharing across various government agencies as well as non-governmental and private organizations to assess the situation; identify the neededresources for emergency response and generate response plans. Interoperability is a keyrequirement for information sharing from disparate systems and organizations; such as thecase in emergency response. In this paper; we present a emergency response system thatcomprises of the following component:(1) ontology library for resolving the semanticdifferences of information pertaining to the incident; its severity; resource requirements andresource availability;(2) reasoning engine for deriving the resource requirements andemergency response plans based on the policies of different agencies and modes of …,Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Digital Government Research Conference on Public Administration Online: Challenges and Opportunities,2010,10
Enforcing separation of duty in attribute based access control systems,Sadhana Jha; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Conventional access control models like discretionary access control and rolebased access control are suitable for regulating access to resources by known users of anorganization. However; for systems where the user population is dynamic and the identitiesof all users are not known in advance; attribute based access control (ABAC) can be moreconveniently used. The set of constraints supported by an access control model acts as adeciding factor for the type of restrictions it can put on unauthorized access. Among thevarious types of constraints; enforcement of Separation of Duty (SoD) is considered to be themost important in any commercial application. In this paper; we introduce the problem ofSoD enforcement in the context of ABAC. We analyze the complexity of the problem andprovide a methodology for solving it. Experiments on a wide range of data sets show …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2015,8
Security analysis for temporal role based access control,Emre Uzun; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural; Anna Lisa Ferrara; Gennaro Parlato; P Madhusudan,Abstract Providing restrictive and secure access to resources is a challenging and sociallyimportant problem. Among the many formal security models; Role Based Access Control(RBAC) has become the norm in many of today's organizations for enforcing security. Forevery model; it is necessary to analyze and prove that the corresponding system is secure.Such analysis helps understand the implications of security policies and helps organizationsgain confidence on the control they have on resources while providing access; and deviseand maintain policies.,Journal of Computer Security,2014,8
AMTRAC: An administrative model for temporal role-based access control,Manisha Sharma; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Over the years; Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has received significantattention in system security and administration. The Temporal Role Based Access Control(TRBAC) model is an extension of RBAC that allows one to specify periodic enabling anddisabling of roles in a role enabling base (REB). While decentralized administration anddelegation of administrative responsibilities in large RBAC systems is managed using anadministrative role based access control model like ARBAC97; no administrative model forTRBAC has yet been proposed. In this paper; we introduce such a model and name itAMTRAC (Administrative Model for Temporal Role based Access Control). AMTRAC definesa broad range of relations that control user-role assignment; role-permission assignment;role–role assignment and role enabling base assignment. Since the first three are similar …,Computers & Security,2013,8
Community based emergency response,David Lorenzi; Jaideep Vaidya; Soon Chun; Basit Shafiq; Varuna Naik; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Nabil Adam,Abstract This paper explores the idea of government emergency response and disastermanagement through the lens of popular social media services. One of the traditionalchallenges to effective emergency response and disaster management is communicationbetween the government and its constituents. As a consequence of this lack ofcommunication; organization of work can often be difficult or allocated in an inefficient and/orineffective manner. After reviewing case studies in which the use of social media providedpositive outcomes for all parties involved during periods of disaster or a state of emergency;we propose a new system designed to" empower the victims"--that is--to mobilize citizenvolunteers in assisting the government. This frees up government resources to handle moreserious problems and speeds the recovery process. This system takes the form of three …,Proceedings of the 14th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research,2013,8
A framework for verification and optimal reconfiguration of event-driven role based access control policies,Basit Shafiq; Jaideep S Vaidya; Arif Ghafoor; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Role based access control (RBAC) is the de facto model used for advanced accesscontrol due to its inherent richness and flexibility. Despite its great success at modeling avariety of organizational needs; maintaining large complex policies is a challengingproblem. Conflicts within policies can expose the underlying system to numerousvulnerabilities and security risks. Therefore; more comprehensive verification tools for RBACneed to be developed to enable effective access control. In this paper; we propose averification framework for detection and resolution of inconsistencies and conflicts in policiesmodeled through event-driven RBAC; an important subset of generalized temporal RBACapplicable to many domains; such as SCADA systems. We define the conflict resolutionproblem and propose an integer programming based heuristic.

Using QR codes for enhancing the scope of digital government services,David Lorenzi; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Ghulam Nabi; Soon Chun; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Digital government is universally gaining acceptance as the public becomes moretechnologically advanced. The government must embrace new technology to minimize costsand maximize utility of services to the taxpayer. While administrative services have beeneasily ported to the digital world; there are still many important citizen-centric services thathave not yet been effectively migrated. Quick Response codes (QR codes) provide a meansto effectively distribute many different varieties of information to the public. We propose a QRcode system and a corresponding smartphone application for the US National Park Service(NPS) with the goal of providing a new level of interactivity for the public. The focus is ondeveloping a QR code waypoint system for park navigation; as well as incentivizing park usethrough gamification of site attractions.

Reachability analysis in privacy-preserving perturbed graphs,Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam; Xiaodong Lin,Many real world phenomena can be naturally modeled as graph structures whose nodesrepresenting entities and whose edges representing interactions or relationships betweenentities. The analysis of the graph data have many practical implications. However; therelease of the data often poses considerable privacy risk to the individuals involved. In thispaper; we address the edge privacy problem in graphs. In particular; we explore randomperturbation for privacy preservation in graph data; and propose an iterative derivationprocess to analyze node reachability within the graph. We specifically focus on deriving theprobability that the shortest path linking two nodes in a directed graph is of a particularlength. This allows us to determine the expected length of the shortest path between twonodes; and determine whether they are linked or not.

Anonymization models for directional location based service environments,Heechang Shin; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Location based services (LBS) aim to deliver information based on a mobile user'slocation. However; knowledge of the location can be used by an adversary to physicallylocate the person; leading to the risk of physical harm; as well as possible leakage of certainpersonal information. This has serious consequences on privacy. The concept of location k-anonymity has been proposed to address this. Under this notion of anonymity; the adversaryonly has the knowledge that the LBS request is originating from a region containing at leastk people; and therefore cannot individually distinguish the user. However; the existinganonymity models ignore the movement information of mobile users; assuming that it has noimpact on privacy. Thus; existing work cannot ensure complete privacy while servingadvanced type of LBS requests that require information about direction as well as speed …,computers & security,2010,8
Collusion set detection through outlier discovery,Vandana P Janeja; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya; Nabil R Adam,Abstract The ability to identify collusive malicious behavior is critical in today's securityenvironment. We pose the general problem of Collusion Set Detection (CSD): identifyingsets of behavior that together satisfy some notion of “interesting behavior”. For this paper; wefocus on a subset of the problem (called CSD′); by restricting our attention only to outliers.In the process of proposing the solution; we make the following novel research contributions:First; we propose a suitable distance metric; called the collusion distance metric; andformally prove that it indeed is a distance metric. We propose a collusion distance basedoutlier detection (CDB) algorithm that is capable of identifying the causal dimensions (n)responsible for the outlierness; and demonstrate that it improves both precision and recall;when compared to the Euclidean based outlier detection.

Utilizing social media to improve local government responsiveness,David Lorenzi; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Soon Chun; Neelima Vegesna; Zamil Alzamil; Nabil Adam; Seth Wainer; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract In this paper; we investigate ways that social media platforms can enhance theresponsiveness of branches of local government that deal primarily in performing tasks onthe behalf of citizens or interacting with them. More specifically; we utilize the Twitter platform(on the web and capable smartphones) to provide a two way communications channelbetween a local government system and citizens. Through such social media drivencommunication; citizens can submit requests for work to be completed; which could then becarried out by the local government. The goal of such a system is to enable the localgovernment to increase responsiveness and gain efficiency in its manpower usage throughoptimized route planning and intelligent work dispatch.,Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research,2014,7

Boolean matrix decomposition problem: theory; variations and applications to data engineering,Jaideep Vaidya,With the ubiquitous nature and sheer scale of data collection; the problem of datasummarization is most critical for effective data management. Classical matrixdecomposition techniques have often been used for this purpose; and have been thesubject of much study. In recent years; several other forms of decomposition; includingBoolean Matrix Decomposition have become of significant practical interest. Since much ofthe data collected is categorical in nature; it can be viewed in terms of a Boolean matrix.Boolean matrix decomposition (BMD); wherein a boolean matrix is expressed as a productof two Boolean matrices; can be used to provide concise and interpretable representationsof Boolean data sets. The decomposed matrices give the set of meaningful concepts andtheir combination which can be used to reconstruct the original data.

A survey of role mining,Barsha Mitra; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the most widely used model for advancedaccess control deployed in diverse enterprises of all sizes. RBAC critically depends ondefining roles; which are a functional intermediate between users and permissions. Thus; forRBAC to be effective; an appropriate set of roles needs to be identified. Since manyorganizations already have user-permission assignments defined in some form; it makessense to identify roles from this existing information. This process; known as role mining; isone of the critical steps for successful RBAC adoption in any enterprise. In recent years;numerous role mining techniques have been developed; which take into account thecharacteristics of the core RBAC model; as well as its various extended features. In thisarticle; we comprehensively study and classify the basic problem of role mining along …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2016,6
Minimizing organizational user requirement while meeting security constraints,Arindam Roy; Shamik Sural; Arun Kumar Majumdar; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Large systems are complex and typically need automatic configuration to bemanaged effectively. In any organization; numerous tasks have to be carried out byemployees. However; due to security needs; it is not feasible to directly assign any existingtask to the first available employee. In order to meet many additional security requirements;constraints such as separation of duty; cardinality and binding have to be taken intoconsideration. Meeting these requirements imposes extra burden on organizations; which;however; is unavoidable in order to ensure security. While a trivial way of ensuring securityis to assign each user to a single task; business organizations would typically like tominimize their costs and keep staffing requirements to a minimum. To meet thesecontradictory goals; we define the problem of Cardinality Constrained-Mutually Exclusive …,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems (TMIS),2015,6
The generalized temporal role mining problem,Barsha Mitra; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Role mining; the process of deriving a set of roles from the available user-permission assignments; is considered to be an essential step in successful implementationof Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. Traditional role mining techniques;however; are not equipped to handle temporal extensions of RBAC like the Temporal-RBAC(TRBAC) model. In this paper; we formally define the problem of finding a minimal set ofroles from temporal user-permission assignments; such that in the resulting TRBAC system;users acquire either the same or a subset of the permissions originally assigned to them forthe complete or partial durations of time as specified in the input. We show that the problemis NP-complete and propose a greedy algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm first derives aset of candidate roles from the temporal user-permission assignments and then selects …,Journal of Computer Security,2015,6
Analysis of TRBAC with dynamic temporal role hierarchies,Emre Uzun; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural,Abstract The temporal role based access control (TRBAC) models support the notion oftemporal roles; user-to-role and permission-to-role assignment; as well as allow roleenabling. In this paper; we argue that role hierarchies can be temporal in nature with adynamism that allows it to have a different structure in different time intervals; and safetyanalysis of such extensions is crucial. Towards this end; we propose the temporal rolebased access control model extended with dynamic temporal role hierarchies; denoted asTRBAC RH; and offer an approach to perform its safety analysis. We also present anadministrative model to govern changes to the proposed role hierarchy.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2013,6
Identifying inference attacks against healthcare data repositories,Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Xiaoqian Jiang; Lucila Ohno-Machado,Abstract Health care data repositories play an important role in driving progress in medicalresearch. Finding new pathways to discovery requires having adequate data and relevantanalysis. However; it is critical to ensure the privacy and security of the stored data. In thispaper; we identify a dangerous inference attack against naive suppression basedapproaches that are used to protect sensitive information. We base our attack on thequerying system provided by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project; though it applies ingeneral to any medical database providing a query capability.

Collaboratively solving the traveling salesman problem with limited disclosure,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Haibing Lu; Lingyu Wang,Abstract With increasing resource constraints; optimization is necessary to make the bestuse of scarce resources. Given the ubiquitous connectivity and availability of information;collaborative optimization problems can be formulated by different parties to jointly optimizetheir operations. However; this cannot usually be done without restraint sinceprivacy/security concerns often inhibit the complete sharing of proprietary information. Thefield of privacy-preserving optimization studies how collaborative optimization can beperformed with limited disclosure.

Secure transformation for multiparty linear programming,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract With the rapid increase in computing; storage and networking resources; data is notonly collected and stored; but also collaboratively analyzed. This creates a serious privacyproblem which often inhibits the use of the distributed data. In this paper; we focus on theproblem of linear programming; which is the most important sub-class of optimizationproblems. Specifically; distributed linear programming problems allow different companies(even competitors) to collaboratively seek the maximum profit or minimum cost by betterutilizing the combination of their limited resources (constraints). However; the constraintsand the objective are typically distributed across different companies. Since the constraintsgenerally refer to internal limitations or capacities; and the objective specifies internal costsor value; serious privacy and security problems arise if these are completely disclosed to …,*,2013,5
Attacking image based captchas using image recognition techniques,David Lorenzi; Jaideep Vaidya; Emre Uzun; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract CAPTCHAs have become the de-facto standard in providing protection fromautomated robot attacks against online forms and services. These captchas can take onmany forms; combining the use of text; images or other cognitive tasks that are difficult forcomputers to solve but easy for humans. In this paper; we focus on captchas where thechallenge to be solved is an image recognition task. We show that well established imageclassification techniques and algorithms can be used by attackers to “crack” such captchas.Specifically; we examine three state of the art image recognition captchas; SQ-PIX; ESP-PIX;and ASIRRA; and show that with modern image processing tools; the CAPTCHAs do notprovide much security and can be easily circumvented.,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2012,5

One big challenge is topreserve the confidentiality of information on the cloud. Most typical solutions usecryptographic techniques without considering how well suited they are to the cloud. Thispaper presents a performance case-study on implementing the building blocks of a privacypreserving collaborative filtering (PPCF) scheme in Java on the Google App Engine (GAE/J)cloud platform. The results show that the GAE/J in its current state exhibits seriousperformance bottlenecks for the chosen application scenario.

Privacy-preserving link discovery,Xiaoyun He; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Nabil Adam,Abstract Link discovery is a process of identifying association (s) among different entitiesincluded in a complex network structure. These association (s) may represent anyinteraction among entities; for example between people or even bank accounts. The needfor link discovery arises in many applications including law enforcement; counter-terrorism;social network analysis; intrusion detection; and fraud detection. Given the sensitive natureof information that can be revealed from link discovery; privacy is a major concern from theperspective of both individuals and organizations. For example in the context of financialfraud detection; linking transaction may reveal sensitive information about other individualsnot involved in any fraud.

Mining temporal roles using many-valued concepts,Barsha Mitra; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Many of today's access control policies are associated with temporal restrictions.Under temporal role-based access control (TRBAC); roles have an associated temporalcomponent; which allows them to better encapsulate such temporal access control policies.However; given their complexity; TRBAC systems can only be well managed if the set ofroles is correctly defined. The process of deriving an optimal set of such roles is known astemporal role mining. In this paper; we formally define the temporal role mining problem(TRMP) in the form of a matrix decomposition problem; by introducing a new operator thatmultiplies a set with a Boolean value and redefining existing matrix multiplication operationsin terms of it. We also define a new metric for temporal role mining; called cumulativeoverhead of temporal roles and permissions (CO-TRAP); which takes into consideration …,Computers & Security,2016,4
Secure construction and publication of contingency tables from distributed data,Xiaoyun He; Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Nabil Adam,Abstract Contingency tables are widely used in many fields to analyze the relationship orinfer the association between two or more variables. Indeed; due to their simplicity and ease;they are one of the first methods used to analyze gathered data. Typically; the construction ofcontingency tables from source data is considered straightforward since all data is supposedto be aggregated at a single party. However; in many cases; the collected data may actuallybe federated among different parties. While construction of the global contingency tableswould still be of immense interest; privacy and security concerns may restrict the dataowners from free sharing of the raw data. In this paper; we propose techniques for enablingsecure construction of contingency tables from both horizontally and vertically partitioneddata. Our methods are efficient and secure. We also examine cases where the …,Journal of Computer Security,2011,4

Security analysis of temporal RBAC under an administrative model,Sadhana Jha; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Security analysis of access control models is critical to confirm whether they ensurecertain security properties. Administrative models specify the rules for state transition for anygiven access control model. While security analysis of role-based access control (RBAC)systems has been done using administrative models; work on security analysis of itstemporal; spatial and spatio-temporal extensions has so far not considered the presence ofany corresponding administrative model. In this paper; we present a methodology forperforming security analysis of temporal RBAC (TRBAC) where state changes occur usingthe relations defined in a recently proposed administrative model named as AMTRAC(Administrative Model for Temporal Role-based Access Control). We initially define anumber of security properties for TRBAC. These properties along with a representation of …,Computers & Security,2014,3
PrefRank: fair aggregation of subjective user preferences,Anirban Basu; Juan Camilo Corena; Shinsaku Kiyomoto; Jaideep Vaidya; Stephen Marsh; Yutaka Miyake,Abstract Ranking vast amounts of user-contributed content; such as digital photographs; ishandled well through user-driven ranking; but user-driven ranking is often subjective anddifficult to compare. The analytic hierarchy process helps making sense of subjectiveopinion; whereas finding a global ranking is a problem of rank aggregation of partiallyranked lists. In this position paper; we propose a solution--PrefRank--based on eigenvectorcentrality that helps aggregating partially ranked lists. Our proposed approach can be usedin other application scenarios involving qualitative judgement and ranking; such asreviewing academic papers for a conference.,Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2014,3

In this paper; wepropose a privacy preserving trusted social feedback (TSF) system; in which users obtainfeedback on questions or items from their friends. It is different from and independent of atypical recommender system because the responses from friends are not automated buttailored to specific questions. TSF can be used to complement the results from arecommender system. Our experimental prototype runs on the Google App Engine andutilises the Facebook social network graph.

An administrative model for spatio-temporal role based access control,Manisha Sharma; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract In the present computing environment; access control decisions are often based oncontextual information like the location of users and objects as well as the time of making anaccess request. Several variants of Role based Access Control (RBAC) have recently beenproposed that support spatio-temporal policy specifications. However; unlike theadministrative models available for RBAC; there is no reported literature on completeadministrative models for spatio-temporal role based access control. In this paper; weintroduce an administrative model for the recently proposed ESTARBAC (Enhanced Spatio-temporal Role based Access Control) model and name it as ADMINESTAR (Administrativemodel for Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Role based Access Control).

Analysis ofsuch data can give valuable insights. Frequent subgraph discovery; the problem of findingthe set of subgraphs that is frequent among the underlying database of graphs; has attracteda lot of recent attention. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem.However; all assume that the entire set of graphs is centralized at a single site; which is nottrue in a lot of cases. Furthermore; in a lot of interesting applications; the data is sensitive (forexample; drug discovery; clique detection; etc). In this paper; we address the problem ofprivacy-preserving subgraph discovery. We propose a flexible approach that can utilize anyunderlying frequent subgraph discovery algorithm and uses cryptographic primitives topreserve privacy.

Indeed; nogeneral methods exist that can work in varying scenarios and still achieve goodperformance across the board. In this paper; we actually identify a very interesting problem;where image classification is dangerously easy. We look at the problem of imageclassification; in the specific context of accurately classifying images containing highlysensitive data such as drivers licenses; credit cards and passports. Our key contribution is tobuild a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) network that is able to classify many sensitiveimages with over 90% accuracy; and use this to develop a system to automatically deriveand transcribe sensitive information from image data.

Privacy-preserving trust verification,Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam,Abstract Distributed and open environments require flexible; scalable and extendible trustverification mechanisms to access resources. To address this; the use of digital credentialsas a means for making access decisions has been promoted. The resource owner needs toverify if the requester's credentials satisfy the security policy of the owner. However; suchverification becomes a challenging problem when either the requester does not wish todisclose her credentials before the verification is complete; or the owner wishes to keep itssecurity policy confidential from the requester; or both.

An efficient online auditing approach to limit private data disclosure,Haibing Lu; Yingjiu Li; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract In a database system; disclosure of confidential private data may occur if users canput together the answers of past queries. Traditional access control mechanisms cannotguard against such breaches to private data. Online auditing techniques have beenadvanced to limit such disclosure of private data. Essentially; before answering any query;these techniques inspect the answers of the past queries to determine whether answeringthis query would compromise the stated data disclosure policies. While the primaryrequirement for online auditing is high efficiency; existing auditing approaches areexpensive with respect to both computational time and space. Specifically; this cost isexcessive in the general case of auditing arbitrary aggregate queries over real-valuedconfidential attributes with respect to interval-based privacy disclosure.

Sentiment based Analysis of Tweets during the US Presidential Elections,Ussama Yaqub; Soon Chun; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract In a relatively short period of time; social media has gained significant importanceas a mass communication and public engagement tool for political and governancepurposes. Rapid dissemination of information through social media platforms such asTwitter; provides politicians and campaigners with the ability to broadcast their message to awide audience instantly and directly while bypassing the traditional media channels. In thispaper; we investigate the nature and characteristics of the political discourse that took placeon Twitter during the American Presidential elections of November 2016. The goal of thisstudy is to perform exploratory sentiment based analysis of Twitter data that was gatheredboth before and after the Election Day. Our objective is to identify the nature and sentimentof discussions along with understanding the behavior of users with respect to their Twitter …,Proceedings of the 18th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research,2017,2
Privacy preserving linear programming,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Nicholas Rizzo; Qi Liu,Abstract: With the rapid increase in computing; storage and networking resources; data isnot only collected and stored; but also analyzed. This creates a serious privacy problemwhich often inhibits the use of this data. In this chapter; we investigate and resolve theprivacy issues in a fundamental optimization problem--linear programming (LP) which isformulated by data collected from different parties. We first consider the case where theobjective function and constraints of the linear programming problem are not partitionedbetween two parties where one party privately holds the objective function while the otherparty privately holds the constraints. Second; we present a privacy preserving technique forthe case that objective function and constraints are arbitrarily partitioned between twoparties where each party privately holds a share of objective function and constraints …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02339,2016,2
Deciphering text from touchscreen key taps,Haritabh Gupta; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Exploiting acoustic emanations from electronic as well as mechanical devices as ameans for side channel attack has recently emerged as a topic of security concern. In thispaper; we present an attack methodology that can be used to extract the text typed by a userfrom the sound recorded by the built-in microphones of a mobile phone. We use signalprocessing techniques to initially extract a likely set of characters per tap on the touchscreenand then use natural language processing algorithms to find the most probable words andsentences that can be constructed from a given tap sequence. We also discuss the causesthat result in this vulnerability and briefly present some countermeasures.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2016,2
Role mining in the presence of separation of duty constraints,Prasuna Sarana; Arindam Roy; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract In recent years; Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has emerged as the mostpopular access control mechanism; especially for commercial applications. In RBAC;permissions are assigned to roles; which are then assigned to users. The key to theeffectiveness of RBAC is the underlying role set that is used. The process of identifying anappropriate set of roles that optimally meets the organizational requirements is called rolemining. One of the most useful constraints that can be expressed in RBAC is Separation ofDuty (SoD). SoD constraints allow organizations to put a restriction on the minimum numberof users required to complete a critical task. However; existing role mining algorithms do nothandle SoD constraints and cannot be easily extended to incorporate SoD constraints. Inthis paper; we consider the problem of role mining when SoD constraints are present. We …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2015,2
Migrating from DAC to RBAC,Emre Uzun; David Lorenzi; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural,Abstract Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most popular means for enforcingaccess control. One of the main reasons for this is that it is perceived as the least expensiveconfiguration with respect to security administration. In this paper; we demonstrate thatsecurity administration is not always cheaper under RBAC when compared to the traditionalDiscretionary Access Control (DAC). If RBAC proves to be beneficial; organizations maychoose to migrate from DAC to RBAC. There have been many algorithms developed togenerate RBAC configurations from DAC configuration. Although these algorithms providean RBAC configuration; the quality of the generated RBAC configuration could vary amongdifferent algorithms and DAC configurations. In this paper; we propose a decision supportframework; which provides a basis for comparison among different potential RBAC …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2015,2
PEER: A Framework for Public Engagement in Emergency Response,David Lorenzi; Soon Ae Chun; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Vijay Atluri; Nabil R Adam,Abstract While government agencies; NGOs; and even commercial entities immediatelyswing into action to help out; in the case of large disasters; one of the biggest resources–citizens themselves–are underutilized. The rise of social media creates an opportunity forthe citizen participation for disaster response management. By harnessing the power ofcitizen crowdsourcing; the government can have enhanced disaster situation awarenessand utilize resources provided by citizen volunteers; resulting in more effective disasterresponses. In this paper; the prototype Public Engagement in Emergency Response (PEER)framework is presented. It provides a comprehensive online and mobile crowdsourcingplatform for situation reporting and resource volunteering.

Enhancing the security of image captchas through noise addition,David Lorenzi; Emre Uzun; Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Text based CAPTCHAs are the de facto method of choice to ensure that humans(rather than automated bots) are interacting with websites. Unfortunately; users often find itinconvenient to read characters and type them in. Image CAPTCHAs provide an alternativethat is often preferred to text-based implementations. However; Image CAPTCHAs have theirown set of security and usability problems. A key issue is their susceptibility to ReverseImage Search (RIS) and Computer Vision (CV) attacks. In this paper; we present ageneralized methodology to transform existing images by applying various noise generationalgorithms into variants that are resilient to such attacks. To evaluate the usability/securitytradeoff; we conduct a user study to determine if the method can provide “usable” imagesthat meet our security requirements–thus improving the overall security provided by …,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2015,2
Lightweight practical private one-way anonymous messaging,Anirban Basu; Juan Camilo Corena; Jaideep Vaidya; Jon Crowcroft; Shinsaku Kiyomoto; Stephen Marsh; Yung Shin Van Der Sype; Toru Nakamura,Abstract Opinions from people; evident in surveys and microblogging; for instance; mayhave bias or low user participation due to legitimate concerns about privacy and anonymity.To provide sender (the participant) anonymity; the identity of the message sender must behidden from the message recipient (the opinion collector) and the contents of the actualmessage hidden from any intermediate actors (such as; routers) that may be responsible forrelaying the message. We propose a novel one-way message routing scheme based onprobabilistic forwarding that guarantees message privacy and sender anonymity throughcryptographic means; utilising an additively homomorphic public-key cryptosystem alongwith a symmetric cipher. Our scheme involves intermediate relays and can work with either acentralised or a decentralised registry that helps with connecting the relays to each other …,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2015,2
Opinions of people: Factoring in privacy and trust,Anirban Basu; Jaideep Vaidya; Juan Camilo Corena; Shinsaku Kiyomoto; Stephen Marsh; Guibing Guo; Jie Zhang; Yutaka Miyake,Abstract The growth of online social networks has seen the utilisation of these networkgraphs for the purpose of providing recommendations. Automated recommendations;however; do not take into account inter-personal trust levels that exist in a social network. Inthis article; we propose a privacy-preserving trusted social feedback (TSF) scheme whereusers can obtain feedback on questions from their friends whom they trust. We show that theconcept can be extended to the domain of crowdsourcing--the trusted crowdsourcing (TCS)scheme. In crowdsourcing; instead of asking friends; one can solicit opinions from experts inthe crowd through a privacy preserving trusted feedback mechanism. Our proposal supportscategorical answers as well as single-valued numerical answers. We evaluate ourproposals in a number of ways: based on a prototype implementation built atop the …,ACM SIGAPP Applied Computing Review,2014,2
Statistical database auditing without query denial threat,Haibing Lu; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Yingjiu Li,Statistical database auditing is the process of checking aggregate queries that are submittedin a continuous manner; to prevent inference disclosure. Compared to other data protectionmechanisms; auditing has the features of flexibility and maximum information. Auditing istypically accomplished by examining responses to past queries to determine whether a newquery can be answered. It has been recognized that query denials release information andcan cause data disclosure. This paper proposes an auditing mechanism that is free of querydenial threat and applicable to mixed types of aggregate queries; including sum; max; min;deviation; etc. The core ideas are (i) deriving the complete information leakage from eachquery denial and (ii) carrying the complete leaked information derived from past answeredand denied queries to audit each new query.

Web services based attacks against image captchas,David Lorenzi; Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract CAPTCHAs provide protection from automated robot attacks against online formsand services. Image recognition CAPTCHAs; which require users to perform an imagerecognition task; have been proposed as a more robust alternative to character recognitionCAPTCHAs. However; in recent years; a number of web services that deal with contentbased image retrieval and analysis have been developed and released for publicconsumption. These web services can be used in completely unexpected ways to attackimage CAPTCHAs. Specifically; in this paper; we consider three specific kinds of webservices: 1) Reverse Image Search (RIS); 2) Image Similarity Search (ISS); and 3) AutomaticLinguistic Annotation (ALA). We show how the functionality of these image based webservices; used in conjunction with regular expressions; keyword ontologies and some …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2013,2
Incorporating privacy into the undergraduate curriculum,Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; David Lorenzi; Nazia Badar,Abstract Today; our social; economic and political systems all make increasing use of theunderlying computing infrastructure; and are heavily reliant on its safety and robustness. Theubiquitous collection and analysis of data through this infrastructure creates a burgeoningprivacy problem. Indeed; special care must be taken to ensure that privacy is not breachedfrom misuse of data flowing through these systems. Recently; the severity of this problemhas been recognized both in the legislature and in the computing research field. However;we still lack a comprehensive view of this important topic in the undergraduate curriculum.Privacy is a critical problem for individuals and society at large.

Risk based access control using classification,Nazia Badar; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Basit Shafiq,Abstract Traditional access control operates under the principle that a user's request to aspecific resource is denied if there does not exist an explicit specification of the permissionin the system. In many emergency and disaster management situations; access to criticalinformation is expected because of the 'need to share'; and in some cases; because of the'responsibility to provide'information. Therefore; the importance of situational semanticscannot be underestimated when access control decisions are made. There is a need forproviding access based on the (unforeseen) situation; where simply denying an access mayhave more deleterious effects than granting access; if the underlying risk is small. Theserequirements have significantly increased the demand for new access control solutions thatprovide flexible; yet secure access. In this paper; we quantify the risk associated with …,*,2013,2
Secure composition of cascaded Web services,Basit Shafiq; Soon Chun; Jaideep Vaidya; Nazia Badar; Nabil Adam,A business process can be developed as a composition of Web services provided bydifferent service providers. These service providers may have their own policies andconstraints for service provisioning and collaboration. In this paper; we focus on securecomposition of services; specifically from the perspective of service enactment. Serviceenactment requires finding an execution plan for the service composition that conforms tothe requirements and constraints of the service requester and all service providers.However; due to privacy and security concerns; participants may selectively expose theirWeb service operations and process details. We propose an approach for service enactmentthat does not require the participants to reveal their internal operations and constraints andthat can still result in an execution plan which satisfies the requirements and constraints …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2012 8th International Conference on,2012,2
Privacy Preserving Integration of Health Care Data,Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam; Tom White,ABSTRACT For health care related research studies the medical records of patients mayneed to be retrieved from multiple sites with different regulations on the disclosure of healthinformation. Given the sensitive nature of health care information; privacy is a major concernwhen patients' health care data is used for research purposes. In this paper; the authorspropose approaches for integration and querying of health care data from multiple sourcesin a secure and privacy preserving manner. In particular; the first approach ensures securedata integration based on unique identifiers; and the second one considers data integrationbased on quasi identifiers; for which a rule-based framework is proposed for cross-linkingdata records; including secure character matching.,*,2012,2
A unified index structure for efficient enforcement of spatiotemporal authorisations,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Qi Guo; Heechang Shin; Jaideep Vaidya,Uncontrolled dissemination of geospatial data may have grave implications on nationalsecurity and personal privacy. Geospatial data can be considered sensitive based onattributes such as the location; resolution and the time of capture; etc. As such;authorisations associated with this data also possess spatial and temporal attributes. Themain contribution of this paper is to improve the response time of access requests; byproposing a unified index structure called*-tree that is capable of indexing bothspatiotemporal objects and authorisations in a single index structure.*-tree is an extension ofR-tree that indexes objects based on their resolutions as well as on their spatial andtemporal attributes and overlays spatiotemporal authorisations on the nodes of the tree.

Secure construction of contingency tables from distributed data,Haibing Lu; Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Nabil Adam,Abstract Contingency tables are widely used in many fields to analyze the relationship orinfer the association between two or more variables. Indeed; due to their simplicity and ease;they are one of the first methods used to analyze gathered data. Typically; the construction ofcontingency tables from source data is considered straightforward since all data is supposedto be aggregated at a single party. However; in many cases; the collected data may actuallybe federated among different parties. Privacy and security concerns may restrict the dataowners from free sharing of the raw data. However; construction of the global contingencytables would still be of immense interest. In this paper; we propose techniques for enablingsecure construction of contingency tables from both horizontally and vertically partitioneddata. Our methods are efficient and secure.

Migrating from RBAC to temporal RBAC,Barsha Mitra; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,The last two decades have witnessed an emergence of role-based access control (RBAC)as the de facto standard for access control. However; for organisations already having adeployed RBAC system; in many cases it may become necessary to associate a temporaldimension with the existing access control policies due to changing organisationalrequirements. In such cases; migration from RBAC to a temporal extension of RBACbecomes essential. Temporal RBAC (TRBAC) is one such RBAC extension. The process ofcreating a set of roles for implementing a TRBAC system is known as temporal role mining.Existing temporal role mining approaches typically assume that TRBAC is being deployedfrom scratch and do not consider it as a migration from an existing RBAC policy. In this study;the authors propose two temporal role mining approaches that enable migration from …,IET Information Security,2017,1
An administrative model for collaborative management of abac systems and its security analysis,Sadhana Jha; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) has been emerging as a suitable choice for largeand federated enterprises due to its flexibility in expressing various types of security policies.Improved flexibility; however; results in higher design complexity and consequently;possibility of undesired flow of information. Reliance of access decision on the attributevalues of subjects; objects and environment underscores the need for a formal way ofmanaging attribute assignment in ABAC systems. Since large enterprises potentially havehundreds of subjects and thousands of resources; centralized management of attributeassignment is inexpedient. This paper introduces an attribute-based administrative modelthat supports decentralized administration of ABAC systems.

Accurate and efficient query clustering via top ranked search results,Yuan Hong; Jaideep Vaidya; Haibing Lu; Wen Ming Liu,Abstract To make the search engine more user-friendly; commercial search enginescommonly develop applications to provide suggestion or recommendation for every posedquery. Clustering semantically similar queries acts as an essential prerequisite to functionwell in those applications. However; clustering queries effectively is quite challenging; sincethey are usually short; incomplete and ambiguous. Existing prevalent clustering methods;such as K-Means or DBSCAN cannot guarantee good performance in such a highlydimensional environment.

A Framework for Policy Similarity Evaluation and Migration Based on Change Detection,Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; David Lorenzi,Abstract Access control facilitates controlled sharing and protection of resources in anenterprise. However; given the ubiquity of collaborative applications and scenarios;enterprises no longer function in isolation. Being able to measure policy similarity andintegrate heterogeneous policies appropriately is an essential step towards secureinteroperation. Existing approaches for measuring policy similarity are based on computingsimilarity between different components of the access control policy. However; this does notprovide a pathway for integrating policies; and may not sufficiently take the security contextinto account. In this paper; we propose a holistic change detection approach that enablespolicy similarity evaluation and policy migration. Our approach more comprehensively takesinto account different access control semantics to compute policy similarity and finds the …,International Conference on Network and System Security,2015,1
Preserving privacy in collaborative Business Process Composition,Hassaan Irshad; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Muhammad Ahmed Bashir; Shafay Shamail; Nabil Adam,Collaborative business process composition exploits the knowledge of existing businessprocesses of related organizations to compose an executable business process for a givenorganization based on its requirements and design specifications. Typically; this requiresorganizations to share and upload their existing business process execution sequences to acentral repository. However; even after masking of confidential data; the executionsequences may still include sensitive business information which organizations may notwant to share with their competitors.

Temporal RBAC security analysis using logic programming in the presence of administrative policies,Sadhana Jha; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Temporal Role Based Access Control (TRBAC) is an extension of the role basedaccess control (RBAC) model in the temporal domain. It is used by organizations needing toenforce temporal constraints on enabling and disabling of roles. For any chosen accesscontrol model; decentralization of administrative authority necessitates the use of a separateadministrative model. Even with the use of an administrative model; decentralization oftenleads to an increased concern for security. Analysis of security properties of RBAC has beenextensively done using its administrative model (ARBAC97). However; TRBAC securityanalysis in the presence of an administrative model so far has received limited attention.This paper proposes a method for performing formal security analysis of TRBAC consideringa recently proposed administrative model named AMTRAC; which includes all the …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2014,1
Privacy Preserving Maximum-Flow Computation in Distributed Graphs,Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam,The maximum-flow problem arises in a wide variety of applications such as financialtransactions and logistics collaboration networks; where the data can be modeled as adirected graph. In many such applications; the graph data is actually distributed acrossseveral organizations where each owns a portion of the overall graph. Due to privacyconcerns; the parties may not wish to disclose their local graphs. However; the computationof maximum-flow over the overall graph brings great benefits to concerned stakeholders. Inthis paper; we address the privacy preserving maximum-flow computation problem indistributed graphs. We propose a two-stage approach that achieves privacy protection whileensuring the correct maximum flow computation.

Automating security configuration and administration: an access control perspective,Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Access control facilitates controlled sharing and protection of resources in anenterprise. When correctly implemented and administered; it is effective in providingsecurity. However; in many cases; there is a belief on the part of the consumers that securityrequirements can be met by simply acquiring and installing a product. Unfortunately; sincethe security requirements of each organization are different; there is no single tool (or evenany meaningful set of tools) that can be readily employed. Independent of the specific policyadopted; such as discretionary access control or role-based access control; mostorganizations today perform permission assignment to its entities on a more or less ad-hocbasis. Permissions assigned to entities are poorly documented; and not understood in theirentirety. Such lack of system administrators' awareness of comprehensive view of total …,International Workshop on Security,2010,1

Specification and Verification of Separation of Duty Constraints in Attribute-Based Access Control,Sadhana Jha; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Constraints form an important aspect of any access control system and are often regardedas one of the principle motivations behind developing different access control models. Thetwo primary concerns related to a constraint are its specification and enforcement. Amongthe various types of constraints; enforcement of the Separation of Duty (SoD) constraint isconsidered to be the most important in commercial applications. In this paper; we introducethe problem of SoD specification; verification; and enforcement in attribute-based accesscontrol (ABAC) systems. We then demonstrate the effect of modifications in the differentcomponents of ABAC on enforcement. We also analyze the complexity of the enforcementproblem and provide a methodology for solving it.

Knowledge of existing BPs of related organizations can beexploited for collaborative BP development. However; syntactic and semantic heterogeneityamong the Web service operations of BPs across organizations is a major obstacle to suchcollaborative BP development. In this paper; we propose an approach for collaborative BPdevelopment that exploits the attribute and structural similarity of related BPs as well as thesemantic information including preconditions and postconditions of operations; to compute amapping between the available service operations of the user organization and the BPoperations of other organizations.

Preventing Unauthorized Data Flows,Emre Uzun; Gennaro Parlato; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Anna Lisa Ferrara; Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural; David Lorenzi,Abstract Trojan Horse attacks can lead to unauthorized data flows and can cause either aconfidentiality violation or an integrity violation. Existing solutions to address this problememploy analysis techniques that keep track of all subject accesses to objects; and hence canbe expensive. In this paper we show that for an unauthorized flow to exist in an accesscontrol matrix; a flow of length one must exist. Thus; to eliminate unauthorized flows; it issufficient to remove all one-step flows; thereby avoiding the need for expensive transitiveclosure computations. This new insight allows us to develop an efficient methodology toidentify and prevent all unauthorized flows leading to confidentiality and integrity violations.We develop separate solutions for two different environments that occur in real life; andexperimentally validate the efficiency and restrictiveness of the proposed approaches …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2017,*
Poster: Constrained Policy Mining in Attribute Based Access Control,Mayank Gautam; Sadhana Jha; Shamik Sural; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract In practical access control systems; it is important to enforce an upper bound on thetime taken to respond to an access request. This response time is directly influenced by thesize (often called the weight) of each of the underlying access control rules. We present aconstrained policy mining algorithm which takes an access control matrix as input andgenerates a set of attribute based access control (ABAC) rules; such that the weight of eachrule is not more than a specified value and the sum of weights of all the rules is minimized.Our initial experiments show encouraging results.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM on Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2017,*
Evaluating the Privacy Implications of Frequent Itemset Disclosure,Edoardo Serra; Jaideep Vaidya; Haritha Akella; Ashish Sharma,Abstract Frequent itemset mining is a fundamental data analytics task. In many cases; due toprivacy concerns; only the frequent itemsets are released instead of the underlying data.However; it is not clear how to evaluate the privacy implications of the disclosure of thefrequent itemsets. Towards this; in this paper; we define the k-distant-IFM-solutions problem;which aims to find k transaction datasets whose pair distance is maximized. The degree ofdifference between the reconstructed datasets provides a way to evaluate the privacy risk.Since the problem is NP-hard; we propose a 2-approximate solution as well as fasterheuristics; and evaluate them on real data.,IFIP International Conference on ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,2017,*

We propose a novel CAPTCHA called EmojiTCHA which utilizessymbolic representations of human emotions in the form of emojis correlated to an image ofreal humans expressing the same emotion on their face. By leveraging the Project OxfordEmotion API from Microsoft's cognitive services platform; which provides automateddetection of human emotion expressions on human faces; we generate a tagged dataset inan automated fashion.

Given the sensitivity of the information involved; our key contribution isto develop a secure k-NN computation protocol that can enable the computation k-NNqueries in a distributed multi-party environment while taking domain semantics into account.The experimental results show that the proposed protocols are extremely efficient.,IFIP International Conference on ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,2017,*
On Optimal Employee Assignment in Constrained Role-Based Access Control Systems,Arindam Roy; Shamik Sural; Arun Kumar Majumdar; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract Since any organizational environment is typically resource constrained; especiallyin terms of human capital; organization managers would like to maximize the utilization ofavailable human resources. However; tasks cannot simply be assigned to arbitraryemployees since the employee needs to have the necessary capabilities for executing atask. Furthermore; security policies constrain the assignment of tasks to employees;especially given the other tasks assigned to the same employee. Since role-based accesscontrol (RBAC) is the most commonly used access control model for commercial informationsystems; we limit our attention to consider constraints in RBAC. In this article; we define theEmployee Assignment Problem (EAP); which aims to identify an employee to roleassignment such that it permits the maximal flexibility in assigning tasks to employees …,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems (TMIS),2017,*
Friends are forever? Evolution of active friendship clusters in online social networks,Haritabh Gupta; Shamik Sural; Niloy Ganguly; Jaideep Vaidya,The goal of this paper is to study how friendship clusters evolve in online social networks.Results obtained from our work on Facebook data indicate that the set of friends whoactively interact during a particular time interval is only a fraction of the total number of listedfriends and this set of active friends tends to evolve with time. Interaction footprints on thetimeline are used to cluster such active friends. Since there is a temporal variation in theseclusters; it is modeled as a graph; wherein nodes represent cluster memberships and edgeweights represent the number of common members between a pair of nodes. Novelmethodologies for predicting the size and membership of the next active cluster based onthe features extracted from past interaction of a user are introduced and their performanceevaluated.,Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS); 2017 9th International Conference on,2017,*
Privacy-preserving item-based recommendations over partitioned data with overlaps,Ibrahim Yakut; Jaideep Vaidya,User ratings are vital elements to drive recommender systems and; in the case of aninsufficient amount of ratings; companies may prefer to operate recommender services overpartitioned data. To make this feasible; there are privacy-preserving schemes. However;such solutions currently have not comprehensively investigated probable rating overlapsamong partitioned data. Such overlaps make collaboration over partitioned data morechallenging; especially if overlapped values are divergent. In this study; we examine thisprivacy-preserving recommender problem and propose novel schemes in this sense. Bymeans of our schemes; two parties can perform item-based collaborative filtering overpartitioned data with divergent overlaps. We also show that the proposed solutions promoteprediction quality with tolerable overheads.,International Journal of Business Information Systems,2017,*
Collaborative Differentially Private Outlier Detection for Categorical Data,Hafiz Asif; Tanay Talukdar; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam,Collaborative analytics is crucial to extract value from data collected by differentorganizations and stored in separate silos. However; privacy and legal concerns often inhibitthe integration and joint analysis of data. One of the most important data analytics tasks isthat of outlier detection; which aims to find abnormal entities that are significantly differentfrom the remaining data. In this paper; we define privacy in the context of collaborativeoutlier detection and develop a novel method to find outliers from horizontally partitionedcategorical data in a privacy-preserving manner. Our method is based on a scalable outlierdetection technique that uses attribute value frequencies. We provide an end-to-end privacyguarantee by using the differential privacy model and secure multiparty computationtechniques. Experiments on real data show that our proposed technique is both effective …,Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC); 2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on,2016,*
PrefRank: Quantification and Aggregation of Subjective User Preferences,Anirban Basu; Shinsaku Kiyomoto; Jaideep Vaidya; Stephen Marsh,User-contributed content on the Internet has been growing at an extraordinary pace.Ranking vast amounts of such content; such as digital photographs; is handled well throughuser-driven ranking. It helps speeding up the ranking process while reflecting the opinions ofthe community. However; user-driven ranking can be often subjective and difficult tocompare. We solve this using a well-known mathematical technique called the analytichierarchy process. Due to the massive size of the user-contributed content; it is often notpossible for all users to rank all items. Thus; finding a global ranking is a problem of rankaggregation of partially ranked lists. In this position paper; we propose a solution-PrefRank-based on eigenvector centrality that helps aggregating partially ranked lists. Our proposedapproach can be used in other application scenarios involving qualitative judgement and …,Trustcom/BigDataSE/I​ SPA; 2016 IEEE,2016,*
Efficient Evaluation of Authorizations for Video Data,Ussama Yaqub; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract With ever increasing volume of video data; ensuring effective access control tovideo content has become one of the most important and pressing problems in the domainof information security. The traditional access control mechanisms are inadequate due to thecomplex nature of video access control where the requirements are not only to restrictaccess to videos based on their IDs; but also ensuring security of content within the videos(eg; people; objects and events). For example; even if two users have access to the samevideo; they might not have access to the same objects or sequence of frames. While there issignificant work in the area of video access control models; it is primarily limited tospecification and does not satisfactorily address evaluation. In this paper; we present anovel way to overlay authorizations on the video context indexing structure to allow …,Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks,2016,*
Using classification for role-based access control management,Nazia Badar; Jaideep Vaidya; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Nino Vincenzo Verde; Janice Warner,Access control is based on the specification of rights to resources. Role-based accesscontrol (RBAC) has emerged as one of the most robust security models which significantlysimplifies administrative overheads. Despite all the compelling benefits that RBAC offers; itstill lacks the ability to handle dynamic environment aspect and handling any unforeseensituations. Manual intervention becomes necessary when a user who is not previouslydefined in the system requests an access. For a system administrator; it becomeschallenging to decide whether a submitted request should be honoured or not and how anew user can be added to the existing system in a secure manner. These issues havesignificantly increased the demand for new access control solutions that provide flexible; yetsecure access.

Managing Multi-dimensional Multi-granular Security Policies Using Data Warehousing,Mahendra Pratap Singh; Shamik Sural; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Jaideep Vaidya; Ussama Yakub,Abstract Over the last several years; sophisticated access control models have beenproposed to take into account different dimensions such as time; space; role; context;attribute; etc. These enable specification of fine grained access control policies that canbetter express evolving organizational needs. However; there is no comprehensive solutionthat can uniformly specify; evaluate; maintain and analyze this multitude of policies in aconsistent fashion. In this paper; we show that specifying and enforcing access controlpolicies of multiple granularities and dimensions can be transformed into the problem ofstoring and querying data at multiple granularities and dimensions. Specifically; we developa unified schema to represent several standard access control policies and show how theycan be automatically evaluated.

A Privacy-Sensitive Collaborative Approach to Business Process Development,Hassaan Irshad; Basit Shafiq; Jaideep Vaidya; Muhammad Ahmed Bashir; Hafiz Salman Asif; Sameera Ghayyur; Shafay Shamail; Adam Nabil,Abstract The objective of this paper is to enable organizations to generate an executablebusiness process from high level design specifications. The basic idea is to exploit theknowledge of the existing business processes of related organizations to generate anexecutable business process for the given organization based on its requirements.However; this requires organizations with existing business processes to share their processexecution sequences. Since the execution sequences (even after data sanitization) stillinclude sensitive business information which organizations may not want to share with theircompetitors; this needs to be done in a privacy-sensitive way. Towards this; we propose aprivacy preserving approach for generating a repository of business process executionsequences.

Migrating from DAC to RBAC,Jaideep Vaidya; Shamik Sural,Abstract. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most popular means for enforcingaccess control. One of the main reasons for this is that it is perceived as the least expensiveconfiguration with respect to security administration. In this paper; we demonstrate thatsecurity administration is not always cheaper under RBAC when compared to the traditionalDiscretionary Access Control (DAC). If RBAC proves to be beneficial; organizations maychoose to migrate from DAC to RBAC. There have been many algorithms developed togenerate RBAC configurations from DAC configuration. Although these algorithms providean RBAC configuration; the quality of the generated RBAC configuration could vary amongdifferent algorithms and DAC configurations. In this paper; we propose a decision supportframework; which provides a basis for comparison among different potential RBAC …,Data and Applications Security and Privacy XXIX: 29th Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference; DBSec 2015; Fairfax; VA; USA; July 13-15; 2015; Proceedings,2015,*

To alleviate those concerns; the identity ofa message sender should be disassociated from the message while the contents of theactual message should be hidden from any relaying nodes. We propose a novel messagerouting scheme based on probabilistic forwarding that guarantees message privacy andsender anonymity through additively homomorphic public-key encryption.

While their analysis could bebeneficial in many aspects; publishing certain types of social networks raises significantprivacy concerns. This brings the problem of graph anonymization into sharp focus. Unlikerelational data; the true information in graph structured data is encoded within the structureand graph properties.

Google App Engine におけるプライバシー保護協調フィルタリング,Anirban Basu; Jaideep Vaidya; Hiroaki Kikuchi; Theo Dimitrakos,Abstract With rating-based collaborative filtering (CF) one can predict the rating that a userwill give to an item; derived from the ratings of other items given by other users. However;preserving privacy of rating data from individual users is a significant challenge. Manyprivacy preserving schemes have; so far; been proposed; such as our earlier work onextending the well known weighted Slope One predictor.

While it is clearthat data can be significantly leveraged for great gains; the use of this data cannot beallowed at the cost of individual privacy. Too often; privacy is an afterthought and this cancause problems. For example; while a terminally ill HIV/AIDS patient may be happy toreceive notice of experimental drugs that he may be unaware of; he definitely would not likehis health information broadcast or even leaked to others. Similarly; laws like the Patriot Actmay be necessary for security; but could represent a significant breach of privacy rights.,Digital Privacy: Theory; Technologies; and Practices,2007,*
Predictive Modeling for Regression,Jaideep Vaidya; Yu Michael Zhu; Christopher W Clifton,Regression is one of the most widely used statistical tools in data analysis and data mining.Suppose that a data set consists of a set of variables referred to as responses and anotherset of variables referred to as attributes (or independent variables). A central problem in dataanalysis is to model the relationship between the responses and the attributes. This is oftentermed as multiple responses multiple regression. A special case is multivariate regression-when the number of responses is one. In this chapter; we only deal with regression with oneresponse. There are two primary goals of regression: one is to identify attributes that affectthe response; the other is to predict the response for a new realization of the attributes; inother words; to fit a regression model. There exist various types of regression that arise fromdifferent model assumptions. The simplest model assumption is to assume that the …,Privacy Preserving Data Mining,2006,*
Finding Patterns and Rules (Association Rules),Jaideep Vaidya; Yu Michael Zhu; Christopher W Clifton,Apart from classification and regression; one of the most important tasks of data mining is tofind patterns in data. The best known data analysis technique in this area is association rulemining. In brief; an association rule is an expression of the form X=> F; where X and Y aresets of items. The meaning of such rules is quite intuitive-Given a database V consisting oftransactions T (where each transaction is a set of items); a rule of the form X^ Y expressesthat whenever a transaction T contains X; then it is likely to contain Y. The degree oflikeliness is expressed by the confidence of the rule which is defined as the number oftransactions containing both X and Y divided by the total number of transactions containingX. That is; the rule confidence is understood as the conditional probability p {YCT\X CT).Association rule mining originated from the analysis of market-basket data where rules …,Privacy Preserving Data Mining,2006,*

Perhaps the most apparent is adoption; these techniques havenot yet seen real-world application. We see two most likely routes to adoption of privacy-preserving data mining technologies; both will demand effort that goes beyond algorithmdevelopment. The first route is to develop new markets for data mining: Identify areas wheredata mining has not even been considered; as the sharing or disclosure of data isinconceivable. While legally protected data on individuals could be the source of such data;a more hkely scenario is protecting secrecy of corporate data where collaboration meetscompetition.

Solution Approaches/Problems,Jaideep Vaidya; Yu Michael Zhu; Christopher W Clifton,In the current day and age; data collection is ubiquitous. Collating knowledge from this datais a valuable task. If the data is collected and mined at a single site; the data mining itselfdoes not really pose an additional privacy risk; anyone with access to data at that sitealready has the specific individual information. While privacy laws may restrict use of suchdata for data mining (eg; EC95/46 restricts how private data can be used); controlling suchuse is not really within the domain of privacy-preserving data mining technology. Thetechnologies discussed in this book are instead concerned with preventing disclosure ofprivate data: mining the data when we aren't allowed to see it. If individually identifiable datais not disclosed; the potential for intrusive misuse (and the resultant privacy breach) iseliminated. The techniques presented in this book all start with an assumption that the …,Privacy Preserving Data Mining,2006,*
Predictive Modeling for Classification,Jaideep Vaidya; Yu Michael Zhu; Christopher W Clifton,4.6 Summary We have seen several examples of how to create privacy-preservingclassification algorithms. A common theme is to start with an algorithm and a partitioning ofdata. An appropriate model for preserving privacy is then chosen; If the data comes frommany sources and noise is deemed sufficient to protect privacy; the data is perturbed. Withfewer sources; cryptographic approaches are more appropriate. In either case; the algorithmis analyzed to determine what steps can be computed easily; and which are affected byprivacy. With data perturbation; the problem is generally determining distributions; the effectof noise on individual values will generally average out over time. With cryptographicprotocols; the problem is generally computing a function from distributed inputs; throughclever transformations to that function and use of a limited toolkit of techniques; it is often …,Privacy Preserving Data Mining,2006,*
What is Privacy?,Jaideep Vaidya; Yu Michael Zhu; Christopher W Clifton,A standard dictionary definition of privacy as it pertains to data is" freedom fromunauthorized intrusion"[58]. With respect to privacy-preserving data mining; this doesprovide some insight. If users have given authorization to use the data for the particular datamining task; then there is no privacy issue. However; the second part is more diflacult: If useis not authorized; what use constitutes" intrusion"? A common standard among most privacylaws (eg; European Community privacy guidelines [26] or the US healthcare laws [40]) isthat privacy only applies to" individually identifiable data". Combining intrusion andindividually identifiable leads to a standard to judge privacy-preserving data mining: Aprivacy-preserving data mining technique must ensure that any information disclosed,Privacy Preserving Data Mining,2006,*
Descriptive Modeling (Clustering; Outlier Detection),Jaideep Vaidya; Yu Michael Zhu; Christopher W Clifton,The data mining tasks of the previous chapters-classification; regression; associations-havea clearly defined" right answer".

Descriptive modeling is less clearly defined. With clustering; for example; not only dowe not know in advance what the clusters mean; we may not even know the proper numberof clusters. Descriptive modeling is a much more exploratory process. This poses newchallenges for privacy-preserving data mining. Algorithms for descriptive modeling tend tobe iterative. The simple act of tracking data access across iterations can be revealing. Forexample; if an outlier detection algorithm frequently access a particular individual; it mayimply that the individual is actually quite central.

In the LBS environment; an LBS request is said to preserve location k-anonymity if anadversary cannot distinguish the actual query issuer from at least k-1 other users. In order toachieve location k-anonymity; given an LBS query; recent approaches by Gruteser et al.[4]and Mokbel et al.[7] remove the identifying information such as user id and transform theexact location into a bounding box; called generalized region (GR); containing at least kpeople within it by utilizing a trusted third party. However; these approaches to location …,*,*,*
