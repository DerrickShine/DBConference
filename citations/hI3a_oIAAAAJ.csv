SPATE: small-group PKI-less authenticated trust establishment,Yue-Hsun Lin; Ahren Studer; Yao-Hsin Chen; Hsu-Chun Hsiao; Li-Hsiang Kuo; Jonathan M McCune; King-Hang Wang; Maxwell Krohn; Adrian Perrig; Bo-Yin Yang; Hung-Min Sun; Phen-Lan Lin; Jason Lee,Establishing trust between a group of individuals remains a difficult problem. Prior worksassume trusted infrastructure; require an individual to trust unknown entities; or providerelatively low probabilistic guarantees of authenticity (95 percent for realistic settings). Thiswork presents SPATE; a primitive that allows users to establish trust via mobile devices andphysical interaction. Once the SPATE protocol runs to completion; its participants' mobiledevices have authentic data that their applications can use to interact securely (ie; theprobability of a successful attack is 2-24). For this work; we leverage SPATE as part of alarger system to facilitate efficient; secure; and user-friendly collaboration via e-mail; file-sharing; and text messaging services.

Building secure tame-like multivariate public-key cryptosystems: The new TTS,Bo-Yin Yang; Jiun-Ming Chen,Abstract Multivariate public-key cryptosystems (sometimes polynomial-based PKC's or justmultivariates) handle polynomials of many variables over relatively small fields instead ofelements of a large ring or group. The “tame-like” or “sparse” class of multivariates aredistinguished by the relatively few terms that they have per central equation. We explain howthey differ from the “big-field” type of multivariates; represented by derivatives of C∗ andHFE; how they are better; and give basic security criteria for them. The last is shown to besatisfied by efficient schemes called “Enhanced TTS” which is built on a combination of theOil-and-Vinegar and Triangular ideas. Their security levels are estimated. In this process wesummarize and in some cases; improve rank-based attacks; which seek linear combinationsof certain matrices at given ranks.

ECM on graphics cards,Daniel J Bernstein; Tien-Ren Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng; Tanja Lange; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract This paper reports record-setting performance for the elliptic-curve method ofinteger factorization: for example; 926.11 curves/second for ECM stage 1 with B 1= 8192 for280-bit integers on a single PC. The state-of-the-art GMP-ECM software handles 124.71curves/second for ECM stage 1 with B 1= 8192 for 280-bit integers using all four cores of a2.4 GHz Core 2 Quad Q6600. The extra speed takes advantage of extra hardware;specifically two NVIDIA GTX 295 graphics cards; using a new ECM implementationintroduced in this paper. Our implementation uses Edwards curves; relies on new paralleladdition formulas; and is carefully tuned for the highly parallel GPU architecture. On a singleGTX 295 the implementation performs 41.88 million modular multiplications per second for ageneral 280-bit modulus.

On asymptotic security estimates in XL and Gröbner bases-related algebraic cryptanalysis,Bo-Yin Yang; Jiun-Ming Chen; Nicolas T Courtois,Abstract “Algebraic Cryptanalysis” against a cryptosystem often comprises finding enoughrelations that are generally or probabilistically valid; then solving the resultant system. Thesecurity of many schemes (most important being AES) thus depends on the difficulty ofsolving multivariate polynomial equations. Generically; this is NP-hard. The related methodsof XL (eXtended Linearization); Gröbner Bases; and their variants (of which a large numberhas been proposed) form a unified approach to solving equations and thus affect ourassessment and understanding of many cryptosystems. Building on prior theory; we analyzethese XL variants and derive asymptotic formulas giving better security estimates under XL-related algebraic attacks; through this examination we have hopefully improved ourunderstanding of such variants.

GAnGS: gather; authenticate'n group securely,Chia-Hsin Owen Chen; Chung-Wei Chen; Cynthia Kuo; Yan-Hao Lai; Jonathan M McCune; Ahren Studer; Adrian Perrig; Bo-Yin Yang; Tzong-Chen Wu,Abstract Establishing secure communication among a group of physically collocated peopleis a challenge. This problem can be reduced to establishing authentic public keys among allthe participants-these public keys then serve to establish a shared secret symmetric key forencryption and authentication of messages. Unfortunately; in most real-world settings; publickey infrastructures (PKI) are uncommon and distributing a secret in a public space is difficult.Thus; it is a challenge to exchange authentic public keys in a scalable; secure; and easy touse fashion. In this paper; we propose GAnGS; a protocol for the secure exchange ofauthenticated information among a group of people. In contrast to prior work; GAnGS resistsGroup-in-the-Middle and Sybil attacks by malicious insiders; as well as infiltration attacks bymalicious bystanders. GAnGS is designed to be robust to user errors; such as …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking,2008,84
All in the XL family: Theory and practice,Bo-Yin Yang; Jiun-Ming Chen,Abstract The XL (eXtended Linearization) equation-solving algorithm belongs to the sameextended family as the advanced Gröbner Bases methods F 4/F 5. XL and its relatives maybe used as direct attacks against multivariate Public-Key Cryptosystems and as final stagesfor many “algebraic cryptanalysis” used today. We analyze the applicability and performanceof XL and its relatives; particularly for generic systems of equations over medium-sized finitefields. In examining the extended family of Gröbner Bases and XL from theoretical; empiricaland practical viewpoints; we add to the general understanding of equation-solving.Moreover; we give rigorous conditions for the successful termination of XL; Gröbner Basesmethods and relatives. Thus we have a better grasp of how such algebraic attacks should beapplied. We also compute revised security estimates for multivariate cryptosystems.

SSE implementation of multivariate PKCs on modern x86 CPUs,Anna Inn-Tung Chen; Ming-Shing Chen; Tien-Ren Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng; Jintai Ding; Eric Li-Hsiang Kuo; Frost Yu-Shuang Lee; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Multivariate Public Key Cryptosystems (MPKCs) are often touted as future-proofingagainst Quantum Computers. It also has been known for efficiency compared to “traditional”alternatives. However; this advantage seems to erode with the increase of arithmeticresources in modern CPUs and improved algorithms; especially with respect to EllipticCurve Cryptography (ECC). In this paper; we show that hardware advances do not just favorECC. Modern commodity CPUs also have many small integer arithmetic/logic resources;embodied by SSE2 or other vector instruction sets; that are useful for MPKCs. In particular;Intel's SSSE3 instructions can speed up both public and private maps over prior softwareimplementations of Rainbow-type systems up to 4×. Furthermore; MPKCs over fields ofrelatively small odd prime characteristics can exploit SSE2 instructions; supported by …,*,2009,78
New differential-algebraic attacks and reparametrization of rainbow,Jintai Ding; Bo-Yin Yang; Chia-Hsin Owen Chen; Ming-Shing Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng,Abstract A recently proposed class of multivariate Public-Key Cryptosystems; the Rainbow-Like Digital Signature Schemes; in which successive sets of central variables are obtainedfrom previous ones by solving linear equations; seem to lead to efficient schemes (TTS;TRMS; and Rainbow) that perform well on systems of low computational resources. RecentlySFLASH (C∗−) was broken by Dubois; Fouque; Shamir; and Stern via a differential attack. Inthis paper; we exhibit similar algebraic and diffential attacks; that will reduce publishedRainbow-like schemes below their security levels. We will also discuss how parameters forRainbow and TTS schemes should be chosen for practical applications.

Theoretical analysis of XL over small fields,Bo-Yin Yang; Jiun-Ming Chen,Abstract XL was first introduced to solve determined or overdetermined systems of equationsover a finite field as an “algebraic attack” against multivariate cryptosystems. There has beena steady stream of announcements of cryptanalysis of primitives by such attacks; includingstream ciphers (eg Toyocrypt); PKC's; and more controversially block ciphers (AES/Rijndaeland Serpent). Prior discussions of XL are usually heavy in simulations; which are of coursevaluable but we would like more attention to theory; because theory and simulations mustvalidate each other; and there are some nuances not easily discerned from simulations.More effort was made in this direction of recent; but much of it was restricted to a large basefield of size q; which is usually equal to 2 k. By conducting an analysis of XL variants ingeneral; we try to derive rigorous “termination conditions”; minimal degree requirements …,Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy,2004,67
ℓ-Invertible Cycles for $\mathcal {M} $ ultivariate $\mathcal {Q} $ uadratic (${\mathcal {MQ}} $) Public Key Cryptography,Jintai Ding; Christopher Wolf; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract We propose a new basic trapdoor ℓ IC (ℓ-Invertible Cycles) of the mixed field typefor M ultivariate Q uadratic public key cryptosystems. This is the first new basic trapdoorsince the invention of Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar in 1997. ℓ IC can be considered anextended form of the well-known Matsumoto-Imai Scheme A (also MIA or C∗); and sharesome features of stagewise triangular systems. However ℓ IC has very distinctive propertiesof its own. In practice; ℓ IC is much faster than MIA; and can even match the speed of single-field MQ schemes.,International Workshop on Public Key Cryptography,2007,66
A “medium-field” multivariate public-key encryption scheme,Lih-Chung Wang; Bo-Yin Yang; Yuh-Hua Hu; Feipei Lai,Abstract Electronic commerce fundamentally requires two different public-keycryptographical primitives; for key agreement and authentication. We present the newencryption scheme MFE; and provide a performance and security review. MFE belongs tothe MQ class; an alternative class of PKCs also termed Polynomial-Based; or multivariate.They depend on multivariate quadratic systems being unsolvable. The classical trapdoorscentral to PKC's are modular exponentiation for RSA and discrete logarithms forElGamal/DSA/ECC. But they are relatively slow and will be obsoleted by the arrival of QC(Quantum Computers). The argument for MQ-schemes is that they are usually faster; andthere are no known QC-assisted attacks on them. There are several MQ digital signatureschemes being investigated today.

Multivariate public key cryptography,Jintai Ding; Bo-Yin Yang,A multivariate public key cryptosystem (MPKCs for short) have a set of (usually) quadraticpolynomials over a finite field as its public map. Its main security assumption is backed bythe NP-hardness of the problem to solve nonlinear equations over a finite field. This family isconsidered as one of the major families of PKCs that could resist potentially even thepowerful quantum computers of the future. There has been fast and intensive developmentin Multivariate Public Key Cryptography in the last two decades. Some constructions are notas secure as was claimed initially; but others are still viable.

A study of user-friendly hash comparison schemes,Hsu-Chun Hsiao; Yue-Hsun Lin; Ahren Studer; Cassandra Studer; King-Hang Wang; Hiroaki Kikuchi; Adrian Perrig; Hung-Min Sun; Bo-Yin Yang,Several security protocols require a human to compare two hash values to ensuresuccessful completion. When the hash values are represented as long sequences ofnumbers; humans may make a mistake or require significant time and patience to accuratelycompare the hash values. To improve usability during comparison; a number of researchershave proposed various hash representations that use words; sentences; or images ratherthan numbers. This is the first work to perform a comparative study of these hash comparisonschemes to determine which scheme allows the fastest and most accurate comparison. Toevaluate the schemes; we performed an online user study with more than 400 participants.Our findings indicate that only a small number of schemes allow quick and accuratecomparison across a wide range of subjects from varying backgrounds.,Computer Security Applications Conference; 2009.

The behavior of Wiener indices and polynomials of graphs under five graph decorations,Weigen Yan; Bo-Yin Yang; Yeong-Nan Yeh,Abstract The sum of distances between all vertex pairs in a connected graph is known as theWiener index. It is an early index which correlates well with many physico-chemicalproperties of organic compounds and as such has been well studied over the last quarter ofa century. A q-analogue of this index; termed the Wiener polynomial by Hosoya but alsoknown today as the Hosoya polynomial; extends this concept by trying to capture thecomplete distribution of distances in the graph. Mathematicians have studied severaloperators on a connected graph in which we see a subdivision of the edges.

TTS: High-speed signatures on a low-cost smart card,Bo-Yin Yang; Jiun-Ming Chen; Yen-Hung Chen,Abstract TTS is a genre of multivariate digital signature schemes first proposed in 2002. Itspublic map is composed of two affine maps sandwiching a Tame Map; which is a mapinvertible through serial substitution and solving linear equations. We implement the signingand key generation operations for a TTS instance with 20-byte hashes and 28-bytesignatures; on popular extant microcontroller cores compatible to the Intel 8051. Our testsdemonstrates that TTS can be even faster than SFLASH v 2; which is known for its celerity.The sample scheme TTS (20; 28) is fast enough for practical deployment on a low-end 8051-based embedded device. A really low-end part like a stock Intel 8051AH running at 3.57MHz can sign in just 170ms. A better 8051-compatible chip will take a lot less time.

Design principles for HFEv-based multivariate signature schemes,Albrecht Petzoldt; Ming-Shing Chen; Bo-Yin Yang; Chengdong Tao; Jintai Ding,Abstract The Hidden Field Equations (HFE) Cryptosystem as proposed by Patarin is one ofthe best known and most studied multivariate schemes. While the security of the basicscheme appeared to be very weak; the HFEv-variant seems to be a good candidate fordigital signature schemes on the basis of multivariate polynomials. However; the currentlyexisting scheme of this type; the QUARTZ signature scheme; is hardly used in practicebecause of its poor efficiency. In this paper we analyze recent results from Ding and Yangabout the degree of regularity of HFEv-systems and derive from them design principles forsignature schemes of the HFEv-type. Based on these results we propose the new HFEv-based signature scheme Gui; which is more than 100 times faster than QUARTZ andtherefore highly comparable with classical signature schemes such as RSA and ECDSA.,International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security,2015,49
Analysis of QUAD,Bo-Yin Yang; Owen Chia-Hsin Chen; Daniel J Bernstein; Jiun-Ming Chen,Abstract In a Eurocrypt 2006 article entitled “QUAD: A Practical Stream Cipher with ProvableSecurity;” Berbain; Gilbert; and Patarin introduced QUAD; a parametrized family of streamciphers. The article stated that “the security of the novel stream cipher is provably reducibleto the intractability of the MQ problem”; this reduction deduces the infeasibility of attacks onQUAD from the hypothesized infeasibility (with an extra looseness factor) of attacks on thewell-known hard problem of solving systems of multivariate quadratic equations over finitefields. The QUAD talk at Eurocrypt 2006 reported speeds for QUAD instances with 160-bitstate and output block over the fields GF (2); GF (16); and GF (256). This paper discussesboth theoretical and practical aspects of attacking QUAD and of attacking the underlyinghard problem.

Could SFLASH be repaired?,Jintai Ding; Vivien Dubois; Bo-Yin Yang; Owen Chia-Hsin Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng,Abstract The SFLASH signature scheme stood for a decade as the most successfulcryptosystem based on multivariate polynomials; before an efficient attack was finally foundin 2007. In this paper; we review its recent cryptanalysis and we notice that its weaknessescan all be linked to the fact that the cryptosystem is built on the structure of a large field. Asthe attack demonstrates; this richer structure can be accessed by an attacker by using thespecific symmetry of the core function being used. Then; we investigate the effect ofrestricting this large field to a purely linear subset and we find that the symmetries exploitedby the attack are no longer present. At a purely defensive level; this defines acountermeasure which can be used at a moderate overhead. On the theoretical side; thisinforms us of limitations of the recent attack and raises interesting remarks about the …,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2008,46
Implementing minimized multivariate PKC on low-resource embedded systems,Bo-Yin Yang; Chen-Mou Cheng; Bor-Rong Chen; Jiun-Ming Chen,Abstract Multivariate (or MQ) public-key cryptosystems (PKC) are alternatives to traditionalPKCs based on large algebraic structures (eg; RSA and ECC); they usually execute muchfaster than traditional PKCs on the same hardware. However; one major challenge inimplementing multivariates in embedded systems is that the key size can be prohibitivelylarge for applications with stringent resource constraints such as low-cost smart cards;sensor networks (eg; Berkeley motes); and radio-frequency identification (RFID). In thispaper; we investigate strategies for shortening the key of a multivariate PKC. We apply thesestrategies to the Tame Transformation Signatures (TTS) as an example and quantify theimprovement in key size and running speed; both theoretically and via implementation. Wealso investigate ways to save die space and energy consumption in hardware; reporting …,International Conference on Security in Pervasive Computing,2006,46

Compared to the standardexhaustive search technique; our improved approach is more efficient both asymptoticallyand practically. We implemented several optimized versions of our techniques on CPUs andGPUs. Our technique runs more than 10 times faster on modern graphic cards than on themost powerful CPU available.

A more secure and efficacious TTS signature scheme,Jiun-Ming Chen; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract In 2002 the authors introduced the new genre of digital signature scheme TTS(Tame Transformation Signatures) along with a sample scheme TTS/2. TTS is from thefamily of multivariate cryptographic schemes to which the NESSIE primitive SFLASH alsobelongs. It is a realization of T. Moh's theory ([31]) for digital signatures; based on TameTransformations or Tame Maps. Properties of multivariate cryptosystems are determinedmainly by their central maps. TTS uses Tame Maps as their central portion for even greaterspeed than C-derived SFLASH family of schemes; which uses monomials in a large field forthe central portion; previously usually acknowledged as fastest. We show a small flaw inTTS/2 and present an improved TTS implementation which we call TTS/4.

We construct public-key encryptionschemes; and prove their security under the hardness assumption of this family. Also; weprovide a new perspective to look at MQ systems that plays a key role to our design andproof of security. As a consequence; we construct the first public-key encryption scheme thatis provably secure under the MQ assumption. Moreover; our public-key encryption schemeis efficient in the sense that it only needs a ciphertext length L+ poly (k) to encrypt a messageM∈{0; 1} L for any un-prespecified polynomial L; where k is the security parameter.

It represents a first step toward securingmachine-to-machine (M2M) systems using strong; hardware-assisted PKC. In contrast to theconventional wisdom that PKC is too “expensive” for M2M sensors; it actually can lower thetotal cost of ownership because of cost savings in provision; deployment; operation;maintenance; and general management. Furthermore; PKC can be more energy-efficientbecause PKC-based security protocols usually involve less communication than theirsymmetric-key-based counterparts; and communication is getting relatively more and moreexpensive compared with computation.

Degree of regularity for HFEv and HFEv,Jintai Ding; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract In this paper; we first prove an explicit formula which bounds the degree ofregularity of the family of HFEv (“HFE with vinegar”) and HFEv-(“HFE with vinegar andminus”) multivariate public key cryptosystems over a finite field of size q. The degree ofregularity of the polynomial system derived from an HFEv-system is less than or equal to (q-1)(r+ v+ a-1) 2+ 2~ if q is even and r+a is odd;(q-1)(r+ v+ a-1) 2+ 2~\rm otherwise; where theparameters v; D; q; and a are parameters of the cryptosystem denoting respectively thenumber of vinegar variables; the degree of the HFE polynomial; the base field size; and thenumber of removed equations; and r is the “rank” paramter which in the general case isdetermined by D and q as r=⌊\log_q(D-1)⌋+1.

Next; we propose toimprove on the efficiency of the system by using some specially designed polynomialsgenerated by a small number of random parameters; where the security of the system wouldthen relies on stronger assumptions; and we give empirical evidence for the validity of usingsuch polynomials.,International Conference on Information Security and Cryptology,2007,23
Wiener polynomials of some chemically interesting graphs,Bo‐Yin Yang; Yeong‐Nan Yeh,Abstract The chemist Harold Wiener found  (G); the sum of distances between all pairs ofvertices in a connected graph G; to be useful as a predictor of certain physical and chemicalproperties.

Odd-Char Multivariate Hidden Field Equations.,Chia-Hsin Owen Chen; Ming-Shing Chen; Jintai Ding; Fabian Werner; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract. We present a multivariate version of Hidden Field Equations (HFE) over a finitefield of odd characteristic; with an extra embedding modifier. Combining these known ideasmakes our new MPKC (multivariate public key cryptosystem) more efficient and scalablethan any other extant multivariate encryption scheme. Switching to odd characteristics inHFE-like schemes affects how an attacker can make use of field equations. Extensiveempirical tests (using мАgмА-2.14; the best commercially available F4 implementation)suggests that our new construction is indeed secure against algebraic attacks using GröbnerBasis algorithms. The embedding serves both to narrow down choices of pre-images and toguard against a possible Kipnis-Shamir type (rank) attack. We may hence reasonably arguethat for practical sizes; prior attacks take exponential time. We demonstrate that our …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2008,21
Practical-sized instances of multivariate pKCs: Rainbow; TTS; and ℓIC-derivatives,Anna Inn-Tung Chen; Chia-Hsin Owen Chen; Ming-Shing Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract We present instances of MPKCs (multivariate public key cryptosystems) withdesign; given the best attacks we know; and implement them on commodity PC hardware.We also show that they can hold their own compared to traditional alternatives.

Tuning GaussSieve for speed,Robert Fitzpatrick; Christian Bischof; Johannes Buchmann; Özgür Dagdelen; Florian Göpfert; Artur Mariano; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract The area of lattice-based cryptography is growing ever-more prominent as aparadigm for quantum-resistant cryptography. One of the most important hard problemunderpinning the security of lattice-based cryptosystems is the shortest vector problem(SVP). At present; two approaches dominate methods for solving instances of this problem inpractice: enumeration and sieving. In 2010; Micciancio and Voulgaris presented a heuristicmember of the sieving family; known as GaussSieve; demonstrating it to be comparable toenumeration methods in practice. With contemporary lattice-based cryptographic proposalsrelying largely on the hardness of solving the shortest and closest vector problems in ideallattices; examining possible improvements to sieving algorithms becomes highly pertinentsince; at present; only sieving algorithms have been successfully adapted to solve such …,International Conference on Cryptology and Information Security in Latin America,2014,18
Efficient string-commitment from weak bit-commitment,Kai-Min Chung; Feng-Hao Liu; Chi-Jen Lu; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract We study security amplification for commitment schemes and improve the efficiencyof black-box security amplification in the computational setting; where the security holdsagainst PPT active adversaries. We show that ω (log s) black-box calls to a weak bit-commitment scheme with constant security is sufficient to construct a commitment schemewith standard negligible security; where s denotes the security parameter and ω (log s)denotes any super-logarithmic function of s. Furthermore; the resulting scheme is a stringcommitment scheme that can commit to O (log s)-bit strings. This improves on previous workof Damgård et al.[DKS99] and Halevi and Rabin [HR08]; whose transformations require ω(log 2 s) black-box calls to commit a single bit. As a byproduct of our analysis; we alsoimprove the efficiency of security amplification for message authentication codes; digital …,International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security,2010,16
Generalized Wiener indices of zigzagging pentachains,Ivan Gutman; Weigen Yan; Yeong-Nan Yeh; Bo-Yin Yang,The “pentachains” studied in this paper are graphs formed of concatenated 5-cycles. Explicitformulas are obtained for the Schultz and modified Schultz indices of these graphs; as wellas for generalizations of these indices.

Generalized Wiener indices in hexagonal chains,Sen‐Peng Eu; Bo‐Yin Yang; Yeong‐Nan Yeh,Abstract The Wiener index; or the Wiener number; also known as the “sum of distances” of aconnected graph; is one of the quantities associated with a molecular graph that correlatesnicely to physical and chemical properties; and has been studied in depth. An indexproposed by Schultz is shown to be related to the Wiener index for trees; and Ivan Gutmanproposed a modification of the Schultz index with similar properties. We deduce a similarrelationship between these three indices for catacondensed benzenoid hydrocarbons(graphs formed of concatenated hexagons; or hexagonal chains; or sometimes acenes).Indeed; we may define three families of generalized Wiener indices; which include theSchultz and Modified Schultz indices as special cases; such that similar explicit formulae forall generalized Wiener indices hold on hexagonal chains.

TTS: Rank Attacks in Tame-Like Multivariate PKCs.,Bo-Yin Yang; Jiun-Ming Chen; U Nat’l Taiwan,Abstract We herein discuss two modes of attack on multivariate public-key cryptosystems. A2000 Goubin-Courtois article applied these techniques against a special class ofmultivariate PKC's called “Triangular-Plus-Minus”(TPM); and may explain in part the presentdearth of research on “true” multivariates–multivariate PKC's in which the middle map is notreally taken in a much larger field. These attacks operate by finding linear combinations ofmatrices with a given rank. Indeed; we can describe the two attacks very aptly as “high-rank”and “low-rank”. However; TPM was not general enough to cover all pertinent truemultivariate PKC's. Tamelike PKC's; multivariates with relatively few terms per equation inthe central map and an easy inverse; is a superset of TPM that can enjoy both fast privatemaps and short set-up times. However; inattention can still let rank attacks succeed in …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2004,15
Solving quadratic equations with XL on parallel architectures,Chen-Mou Cheng; Tung Chou; Ruben Niederhagen; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Solving a system of multivariate quadratic equations (MQ) is an NP-completeproblem whose complexity estimates are relevant to many cryptographic scenarios. In somecases it is required in the best known attack; sometimes it is a generic attack (such as for themultivariate PKCs); and sometimes it determines a provable level of security (such as for theQUAD stream ciphers). Under reasonable assumptions; the best way to solve generic MQsystems is the XL algorithm implemented with a sparse matrix solver such as Wiedemann'salgorithm. Knowing how much time an implementation of this attack requires gives us agood idea of how future cryptosystems related to MQ can be broken; similar to howimplementations of the General Number Field Sieve that factors smaller RSA numbers giveus more insight into the security of actual RSA-based cryptosystems.

SHA-3 on ARM11 processors,Peter Schwabe; Bo-Yin Yang; Shang-Yi Yang,Abstract This paper presents high-speed assembly implementations of the 256-bit-outputversions of all five SHA-3 finalists and of SHA-256 for the ARM11 family of processors. Wereport new speed records for all of the six implemented functions. For example ourimplementation of the round-3 version of JH-256 is 35% faster than the fastestimplementation of the round-2 version of JH-256 in eBASH. Scaled with the number ofrounds this is more than a 45% improvement. We also improve upon previous assemblyimplementations for 32-bit ARM processors. For example the implementation of Grøstl-256described in this paper is about 20% faster than the arm32 implementation in eBASH.,International Conference on Cryptology in Africa,2012,12

Fast Exhaustive Search for Quadratic Systems in $ $\mathbb {F} _ {2} $ $ on FPGAs,Charles Bouillaguet; Chen-Mou Cheng; Tung Chou; Ruben Niederhagen; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract In 2010; Bouillaguet et al. proposed an efficient solver for polynomial systems overF _ 2 that trades memory for speed BCC+ 10. As a result; 48 quadratic equations in 48variables can be solved on a graphics processing unit (GPU) in 21 min. The researchquestion that we would like to answer in this paper is how specifically designed hardwareperforms on this task. We approach the answer by solving multivariate quadratic systems onreconfigurable hardware; namely Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We show that;although the algorithm proposed in BCC+ 10 has a better asymptotic time complexity thantraditional enumeration algorithms; it does not have a better asymptotic complexity in termsof silicon area. Nevertheless; our FPGA implementation consumes 20–25 times less energythan its GPU counterpart. This is a significant improvement; not to mention that the …,International Conference on Selected Areas in Cryptography,2013,8
Secure PRNGs from Specialized Polynomial Maps over Any $\mathbb {F} _ {q} $,Feng-Hao Liu; Chi-Jen Lu; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Berbain; Gilbert; and Patarin presented QUAD; a pseudo random number generator(PRNG) at Eurocrypt 2006. QUAD (as PRNG and stream cipher) may be proved securebased on an interesting hardness assumption about the one-wayness of multivariatequadratic polynomial systems over F_2. The original BGP proof only worked for F_2 and lefta gap to general F_q. We show that the result can be generalized to any arbitrary finite fieldF_q; and thus produces a stream cipher with alphabets in F_q. Further; we generalize theunderlying hardness assumption to specialized systems in F_q (including F_2) that can beevaluated more efficiently. Barring breakthroughs in the current state-of-the-art for system-solving; a rough implementation of a provably secure instance of our new PRNG is twice asfast and takes 1/10 the storage of an instance of QUAD with the same level of provable …,International Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography,2008,8
Building Instances of TTM Immune to the Goubin-Courtois Attack and the Ding-Schmidt Attack.,T Moh; Jiun-Ming Chen; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract We think that there are two main attacks on TTM cryptosystem; the Goubin-Courtoisattack ([6]) and the Ding-Schmidt attack ([5]). The paper of Goubin-Courtois is not clearlywritten. Their arguments (with many gaps) depend on an parameter ж which is neverdefined. It is nature to take their parameter ж to be the index з used in our” lockpolynomials”(see section 1). Later on Courtois implies otherwise in his website. In theirpaper ([6]) or in his website; Courtois simply declares that TTM is of rank 2 (ie; ж О) withoutany justification. In this paper; we will illustrate another example (cf Example below) satisfiesboth requirements; ie; the index з used in our” lock polynomials”(see section 1) is 7; and thenumber of variables in all quartic forms is 4 which shows that Goubin-Courtois' unsubstantialclaim:” TTM is rank 2” invalid.

Hmfev-an efficient multivariate signature scheme,Albrecht Petzoldt; Ming-Shing Chen; Jintai Ding; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Multivariate Cryptography; as one of the main candidates for establishing post-quantum cryptosystems; provides strong; efficient and well-understood digital signatureschemes such as UOV; Rainbow; and Gui. While Gui provides very short signatures; it is; forefficiency reasons; restricted to very small finite fields; which makes it hard to scale it tohigher levels of security and leads to large key sizes. In this paper we propose a signaturescheme called HMFEv (“Hidden Medium Field Equations”); which can be seen as amultivariate version of HFEv. We obtain our scheme by applying the Vinegar Variation to theMultiHFE encryption scheme of Chen et al. We show both theoretically and by experimentsthat our new scheme is secure against direct and Rank attacks. In contrast to other schemesof the HFE family such as Gui; HMFEv can be defined over arbitrary base fields and …,International workshop on post-quantum cryptography,2017,7

A practical attack on Patched MIFARE classic,Yi-Hao Chiu; Wei-Chih Hong; Li-Ping Chou; Jintai Ding; Bo-Yin Yang; Chen-Mou Cheng,Abstract MIFARE Classic is the world's most widely deployed RFID (radio-frequencyidentification) technology. It was claimed to be cryptographically protected by the proprietaryCrypto-1 stream cipher. However; it proved inadequate after weaknesses in the design andimplementation of Crypto-1 and MIFARE Classic started surfacing since late 2007 [7; 8; 12–17]. Some operators of MIFARE Classic-based systems reacted by upgrading to moresecure alternatives such as MIFARE DESFire. However; many (especially in Asia) opted to“patch” MIFARE Classic instead. Their risk analysis might have gone as follows:“The mostserious threat comes from efficient card-only attacks; where the attacker only needs an off-the-shelf reader and a PC to tamper a target tag.

Stagesof well-known algorithms such as Shellsort and quicksort are evaluated in such a frameworkand shown to cause a meaning drop in the inversion statistic. The expected value; varianceand generating function for the decrease in number of inversions are computed. Thepossibility of “presorting” a sorting algorithm is also investigated under a similar framework.,Theoretical Computer Science,2000,6

Operating Degrees for XL vs. F 4/F 5 for Generic $\mathcal {M} Q $ with Number of Equations Linear in That of Variables,Jenny Yuan-Chun Yeh; Chen-Mou Cheng; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract We discuss the complexity of MQ; or solving multivariate systems of m equations inn variables over the finite field F_q of q elements. MQ is an important hard problem incryptography. In particular; the complexity to solve overdetermined MQ systems withrandomly chosen coefficients when m= cn is related to the provable security of a number ofcryptosystems. In this context there are two basic approaches. One is to use XL (“eXtendedLinearization”) with the solving step tailored to sparse linear algebra; the other is of the manyvariations of Jean-Charles Faugère's F 4/F 5 algorithms. Although F 4/F 5 has been the defacto standard in the cryptographic community; it was proposed (Yang-Chen; 2004) that XLwith Sparse Solver may be superior in some cases; particularly the generic overdeterminedcase with m/n= c+ o (1).

RAIDq: A Software-friendly; Multiple-parity RAID.,Ming-Shing Chen; Bo-Yin Yang; Chen-Mou Cheng,Abstract As disk manufacturers compete to build ever larger and cheaper disks; thepossibility of RAID failures becomes more significant for larger and larger disk arrays;creating opportunities for products beyond RAID 6. In this paper; we present the design andimplementation of RAIDq; a software-friendly; multiple-parity RAID. RAIDq uses a linearcode with efficient encoding and decoding algorithms and addresses a wide range ofgeneral cases of RAID that are of practical interest. However; RAIDq does have a limit onhow many data disks it can support; which we will analyze in this paper. A second benefit ofRAIDq is that it includes existing RAID 5 and 6 as special cases and hence is 100%backward compatible. This allows RAIDq to reuse the efficient coding algorithms andimplementations of RAID 5 and 6. Last but not least; RAIDq is optimized for software …,HotStorage,2013,4
Usable assembly language for GPUs: a success story.,Daniel J Bernstein; Hsieh-Chung Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng; Tanja Lange; Ruben Niederhagen; Peter Schwabe; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract—The NVIDIA compilers nvcc and ptxas leave the programmer with only very limitedcontrol over register allocation; register spills; instruction selection; and instructionscheduling.

It is the earliest of the indices that correlates well with manyphysicochemical properties of organic compounds and as such has been well-studied overthe last quarter of a century. A q-analogue of this index; termed the Wiener Polynomial byHosoya but also known today as the Hosoya Polynomial; extends this concept by trying tocapture the complete distribution of distances in the graph.

Gauss sieve algorithm on gpus,Shang-Yi Yang; Po-Chun Kuo; Bo-Yin Yang; Chen-Mou Cheng,Abstract Lattice-based cryptanalysis is an important field in cryptography since latticeproblems are among the most robust assumptions; and have been used to construct mostcryptographic primitives. In this research; we focus on the Gauss Sieve algorithm; a heuristiclattice sieving algorithm proposed by Micciancio and Voulgaris. We propose the techniqueof lifting computations in prime-cyclotomic ideals into that in cyclic ideals. Lifting makesrotations easier to compute and reduces the complexity of inner products from O (n^ 3) to O(n^ 2). We implemented our Gauss Sieve on GPUs by adapting the framework of Ishiguro etal. in a single GPU; and the one of Bos et al. among multiple GPUs.

Thesecurity of multivariate cryptography definitely becomes lower if a larger field is used insteadof GF (2) given the same number of bits in the key. However; we still would like to use largerfields because multivariate cryptography tends to run faster at the same level of security if alarger field is used.

Efficient parallel evaluation of multivariate quadratic polynomials on gpus,Satoshi Tanaka; Tung Chou; Bo-Yin Yang; Chen-Mou Cheng; Kouichi Sakurai,Abstract QUAD is a provably secure stream cipher; whose security is based on the hardnessassumption of solving multivariate quadratic polynomial systems over a finite field; which isknown to be NP-complete. However; such provable security comes at a price; and QUAD isslower than most other stream ciphers that do not have security proofs. In this paper; wediscuss two efficient parallelization techniques for evaluating multivariate quadraticpolynomial systems on GPU; which can effectively accelerate the QUAD stream cipher. Thefirst approach focuses on formula of summations in quadratics; while the second approachuses parallel reduction to summations. Our approaches can be easily generalized andapplied to other multivariate cryptosystems.,International Workshop on Information Security Applications,2012,3
Post-Quantum Cryptography,J Ding; BY Yang,Three decades ago public-key cryptosystems made a revolutionary breakthrough incryptography. They have developed into an indispensable part of our moderncommunication system. In practical applications RSA; DSA; ECDSA; and similar public keycryptosystems are commonly used. Their security depends on assumptions about thedifficulty of certain problems in number theory; such as the Integer Prime FactorizationProblem or the Discrete Logarithm Problem. However; in 1994 Peter Shor showed thatquantum computers could break any public-key cryptosystem based on these hard numbertheory problems. This means that if a reasonably powerful quantum computer could be built;it would put essentially all modern communication into peril.

Implementing 128-bit secure mpkc signatures,Ming-Shing Chen; Wen-Ding Li; Bo-Yuan Peng; Bo-Yin Yang; Chen-Mou Cheng,Multivariate Public Key Cryptosystems (MPKCs) are often touted as future-proofing againstQuantum Computers. In 2009; it was shown that hardware advances do not favor just“traditional” alternatives such as ECC and RSA; but also makes MPKCs faster and keepsthem competitive at 80-bit security when properly implemented. These techniques becameoutdated due to emergence of new instruction sets and higher requirements on security. Inthis paper; we review how MPKC signatures changes from 2009 including new parameters(from a newer security level at 128-bit); crypto-safe implementations; and the impact of newAVX2 and AESNI instructions. We also present new techniques on evaluating multivariatepolynomials; multiplications of large finite fields by additive Fast Fourier Transforms; andconstant time linear solvers.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Fundamentals of Electronics; Communications and Computer Sciences,2018,2
Faster Multiplication for Long Binary Polynomials,Ming-Shing Chen; Chen-Mou Cheng; Po-Chun Kuo; Wen-Ding Li; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract: We set new speed records for multiplying long polynomials over finite fields ofcharacteristic two. Our multiplication algorithm is based on an additive FFT (Fast FourierTransform) by Lin; Chung; and Huang in 2014 comparing to previously best results basedon multiplicative FFTs. Both methods have similar complexity for arithmetic operations onunderlying finite field; however; our implementation shows that the additive FFT has lessoverhead. For further optimization; we employ a tower field construction because themultipliers in the additive FFT naturally fall into small subfields; which leads to speed-upsusing table-lookup instructions in modern CPUs.

Hydra: An energy-efficient programmable cryptographic coprocessor supporting elliptic-curve pairings over fields of large characteristics,Yun-An Chang; Wei-Chih Hong; Ming-Chun Hsiao; Bo-Yin Yang; An-Yeu Wu; Chen-Mou Cheng,Abstract Bilinear pairings on elliptic curves have many applications in cryptography andcryptanalysis. Pairing computation is more complicated compared to that of other popularpublic-key cryptosystems. Efficient implementation of cryptographic pairing; both software-and hardware-based approaches; has thus received increasing interest. In this paper; wefocus on hardware implementation and present the design of Hydra; an energy-efficientprogrammable cryptographic coprocessor that supports various pairings over fields of largecharacteristics. We also present several implementations of Hydra; among which thesmallest only uses 116 K gates when synthesized in TSMC 90 nm standard cell library.Despite the extra programmability; our design is competitive compared even withspecialized implementations in terms of time-area-cycle product; a common figure of merit …,International Workshop on Security,2014,2
Cyber-Physical System Development Environment for Energy Applications,Thomas Roth; Eugene Song; Martin Burns; Himanshu Neema; William Emfinger; Janos Sztipanovits,abstract Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are smart systems that include engineeredinteracting networks of physical and computational components. The tight integration of awide range of heterogeneous components enables new functionality and quality of lifeimprovements in critical infrastructures such as smart cities; intelligent buildings; and smartenergy systems. One approach to study CPS uses both simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) to test the physical dynamics of hardware in a controlled environment. However;because CPS experiment design may involve domain experts from multiple disciplines whouse different simulation tool suites; it can be a challenge to integrate the heterogeneoussimulation languages and hardware interfaces into a single experiment.

Multi-core FPGA implementation of ECC with homogeneous co-Z coordinate representation,Bo-Yuan Peng; Yuan-Che Hsu; Yu-Jia Chen; Di-Chia Chueh; Chen-Mou Cheng; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Elliptic Curve Cryptography is gaining popularity; and optimization opportunitiesexist on several different levels: algorithm; architecture; and/or implementation. To support awide variety of curves and at the same time resist timing/power-based side-channel attacks;our scalar multiplication is implemented using the Co-Z ladder due to Hutter; Joye; andSierra. We analyze the parallelism of the Co-Z ladder and show that a 12-core (thoughinefficient) system can complete a ladder step with the fastest speed. We also combineoptimizations at every level in an efficient multi-core FPGA implementation. The size of theprime modulus can also be changed easily; for which we have implemented and tested upto 528-bits used in the NIST P-521 curve. Based on this building block; we have developeda multi-core architecture that supports multiple parallel modular additions; multiplications …,International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security,2016,1
Frobenius Additive Fast Fourier Transform,Wen-Ding Li; Ming-Shing Chen; Po-Chun Kuo; Chen-Mou Cheng; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract: In ISSAC 2017; van der Hoeven and Larrieu showed that evaluating a polynomialP in GF (q)[x] of degree< n at all n-th roots of unity in GF ($ q^ d $) can essentially becomputed d-time faster than evaluating Q in GF ($ q^ d $)[x] at all these roots; assuming GF($ q^ d $) contains a primitive n-th root of unity. Termed the Frobenius FFT; this discoveryhas a profound impact on polynomial multiplication; especially for multiplying binarypolynomials; which finds ample application in coding theory and cryptography. In this paper;we show that the theory of Frobenius FFT beautifully generalizes to a class of additive FFTdeveloped by Cantor and Gao-Mateer. Furthermore; we demonstrate the power of Frobeniusadditive FFT for q= 2: to multiply two binary polynomials whose product is of degree< 256;the new technique requires only 29;005 bit operations; while the best result previously …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03932,2018,*
Implementing Joux-Vitse’s Crossbred Algorithm for Solving MQ Systems over F2 on GPUs,Ruben Niederhagen; Kai-Chun Ning; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract. The hardness of solving multivariate quadratic (MQ) systems is the underlyingproblem for multivariate-based schemes in the field of post-quantum cryptography. Theconcrete; practical hardness of this problem needs to be measured by state-of-the-artalgorithms and high-performance implementations. We describe; implement; and evaluatean adaption of the Crossbred algorithm by Joux and Vitse [11] for solving MQ systems overF2. Our adapted algorithm is highly parallelizable and is suitable for solving MQ systems onGPU architectures. Our implementation is able to solve an MQ system of 134 equations in 67variables in 98.39 hours using one single commercial Nvidia GTX 980 graphics card; whilethe original Joux-Vitse algorithm requires 6200 CPU-hours for the same problem size.

Certified Verification of Algebraic Properties on Low-Level Mathematical Constructs in Cryptographic Programs,Ming-Hsien Tsai; Bow-Yaw Wang; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Mathematical constructs are necessary for computation on the underlying algebraicstructures of cryptosystems. They are often written in assembly language and optimizedmanually for efficiency. We develop a certified technique to verify low-level mathematicalconstructs in X25519; the default elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol used inOpenSSH. Our technique translates an algebraic specification of mathematical constructsinto an algebraic problem. The algebraic problem in turn is solved by the computer algebrasystem Singular. The proof assistant Coq certifies the translation and solution to algebraicproblems. Specifications about output ranges and potential program overflows aretranslated to SMT problems and verified by SMT solvers.

A Memory Efficient Variant of an Implementation of the F $ $ _4 $ $ Algorithm for Computing Gröbner Bases,Yun-Ju Huang; Wei-Chih Hong; Chen-Mou Cheng; Jiun-Ming Chen; Bo-Yin Yang,Abstract Solving multivariate systems of polynomial equations is an important problem bothas a subroutine in many problems and in its own right. Currently; the most efficient solversare the Gröbner-basis solvers; which include the XL algorithm 6; as well as F _4 9 and F _510 algorithms. The F _4 is an advanced algorithm for computing Gröbner bases. However;the algorithm has exponential space complexity and does not provide much flexibility interms of controlling memory usage. This poses a serious challenge when we want to use itto solve instances of sizes of practical interest. In this paper; we address the issue of memoryusage by proposing a variant of F _4 algorithm called YAGS (Yet Another Gröbner-basisSolver). YAGS uses less memory than the original algorithm and runs at comparable speedwith F _4. Furthermore; YAGS runs even faster than F _4 when solving dense polynomial …,International Conference on Trusted Systems,2014,*

Specifically; we propose to build around the GNU/Linuxoperating system a POSIX-thread compatible multi-threaded programming model for thereconfigurable CPU/FPGA hybrid platform. Under this programming model; hardware andsoftware computation tasks will be able to communicate efficiently while executing inparallel. Also; the computations carried out by software and hardware are treated in ahomogeneous way and thus interchangeable. Our target application domain is informationsecurity. Specifically; we will implement two applications to demonstrate the effectiveness ofthis new framework. The first one is the acceleration of packet classification in wire-speedfirewall.

Jintai Ding,Auxiliary Submitters; Ming-Shing Chen; Albrecht Petzoldt; Dieter Schmidt; Bo-Yin Yang,The Gui signature scheme as described in this proposal is based on the HFEvsignaturescheme; which was first proposed by Patarin; Courtois and Goubin in [12]. Similar to Gui;their QUARTZ scheme uses a specially designed signature generation process whichallows to reduce key and signature sizes compared to the original HFEv-design. However;while QUARTZ uses an HFE polynomial of high degree as well as small values for thenumbers of minus equations and vinegar variables; Gui follows another approach. Bydecreasing the degree of the HFE polynomial in use while increasing the numbers of minusequations and vinegar variables; we can speed up the signature generation process of thescheme drastically without weakening its security.,*,*,*

Multivariate Cryptography,Bo-Yin Yang; Multivariate Quadratic Public-Key Cryptosystem,Background In general; solving a set of quadratic equations over a finite field is NP-hard(see computational complexity) for any finite field. This problem; known as MQ; is evenconjectured to be probabilistically hard; ie as m; n→∞;∀ ε> 0; and for any probabilisticTuring Machine A; Pr (P (x)= y be solved by A in poly (m; n))< ε. However; it is difficult toobtain a proof of security for multivariate schemes: since the system (Q) has to be easy tosolve; it is never random; and neither is (P) which is obtained by linear changes of variablesfrom (Q). One can always try to solve the system of equations directly using system solversbased on Gröbner bases (XL; F4; F5). For more or less “generic” or “random” equations;most current methods take exponential time when m and n are of the same size. Somesystems appear very non-random under Gröbner basis methods.
