A generic framework for monitoring continuous spatial queries over moving objects,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract This paper proposes a generic framework for monitoring continuous spatial queriesover moving objects. The framework distinguishes itself from existing work by being the firstto address the location update issue and to provide a common interface for monitoringmixed types of queries. Based on the notion of safe region; the client location updatestrategy is developed based on the queries being monitored. Thus; it significantly reducesthe wireless communication and query reevaluation costs required to maintain the up-to-date query results. We propose algorithms for query evaluation/reevaluation and for saferegion computation in this framework. Enhancements are also proposed to take advantageof two practical mobility assumptions: maximum speed and steady movement. Theexperimental results show that our framework substantially outperforms the traditional …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,336
Top-k monitoring in wireless sensor networks,Minji Wu; Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Wang-Chien Lee,Top-k monitoring is important to many wireless sensor applications. This paper exploits thesemantics of top-k query and proposes an energy-efficient monitoring approach called FILA.The basic idea is to install a filter at each sensor node to suppress unnecessary sensorupdates. Filter setting and query reevaluation upon updates are two fundamental issues tothe correctness and efficiency of the FILA approach. We develop a query reevaluationalgorithm that is capable of handling concurrent sensor updates. In particular; we presentoptimization techniques to reduce the probing cost. We design a skewed filter settingscheme; which aims to balance energy consumption and prolong network lifetime.Moreover; two filter update strategies; namely; eager and lazy; are proposed to favordifferent application scenarios. We also extend the algorithms to several variants of top-k …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,260

Extending Network Lifetime for Precision-Constrained Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks.,Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu,Abstract—This paper exploits the tradeoff between data qual-ity and energy consumption toextend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. We consider the applications that requiresome aggregate form of sensed data with precision guarantees. Our key idea is todifferentiate the precisions of data collected from different sensor nodes to balance theirenergy consumption. This is achieved by partitioning the precision constraint of dataaggregation and allocating error bounds to individual sensor nodes in a coordinatedfashion. Three factors affecting the lifetime of sensor nodes are identified:(1) the changingpattern of sensor readings;(2) the residual energy of sensor nodes; and (3) thecommunication cost between the sensor nodes and the base station. We analyze theoptimal precision allocation in terms of network lifetime and propose an adaptive …,INFOCOM,2006,201
Cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location-dependent data in mobile environments,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Mobile location-dependent information services (LDISs) have become increasingly popularin recent years. However; data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received littleattention. In this paper; we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement forlocation-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a newperformance criterion; called caching efficiency; and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition; two cache replacement policies; PAand PAID; are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies; PA and PAID takeinto consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulationexperiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes. The experimentalresults show that the proposed location-dependent invalidation scheme is very effective …,IEEE Transactions on computers,2002,200
Time-critical on-demand data broadcast: Algorithms; analysis; and performance evaluation,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Wang-Chien Lee,On-demand broadcast is an effective wireless data dissemination technique to enhancesystem scalability and deal with dynamic user access patterns. With the rapid growth of time-critical information services in emerging applications; there is an increasing need for thesystem to support timely data dissemination. This paper investigates online schedulingalgorithms for time-critical on-demand data broadcast. We propose a novel schedulingalgorithm called SIN-/spl alpha/that takes the urgency and number of outstanding requestsinto consideration. An efficient implementation of SIN-/spl alpha/is presented. We alsoanalyze the theoretical bound of request drop rate when the request arrival rate rises towardinfinity. Trace-driven experiments show that SIN-/spl alpha/significantly outperforms existingalgorithms over a wide range of workloads and approaches the analytical bound at high …,IEEE Transactions on parallel and distributed systems,2006,189
Processing private queries over untrusted data cloud through privacy homomorphism,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Chushi Ren; Byron Choi,Query processing that preserves both the data privacy of the owner and the query privacy ofthe client is a new research problem. It shows increasing importance as cloud computingdrives more businesses to outsource their data and querying services. However; mostexisting studies; including those on data outsourcing; address the data privacy and queryprivacy separately and cannot be applied to this problem. In this paper; we propose aholistic and efficient solution that comprises a secure traversal framework and an encryptionscheme based on privacy homomorphism. The framework is scalable to large datasets byleveraging an index-based approach. Based on this framework; we devise secure protocolsfor processing typical queries such as k-nearest-neighbor queries (kNN) on R-tree index.Moreover; several optimization techniques are presented to improve the efficiency of the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,188
Proxy caching for media streaming over the Internet,Jiangchuan Liu; Jianliang Xu,Streaming media has contributed to a significant amount of today's Internet traffic. Likeconventional Web objects (eg; HTML pages and images); media objects can benefit fromproxy caching; but their unique features such as huge size and high bandwidth demandimply that conventional proxy caching strategies have to be substantially revised. This articlediscusses the critical issues and challenges of cache management for proxy-assisted mediastreaming. We survey; classify; and compare the state-of-the-art solutions.

Protecting location privacy against location-dependent attacks in mobile services,Xiao Pan; Jianliang Xu; Xiaofeng Meng,Privacy protection has recently received considerable attention in location-based services. Alarge number of location cloaking algorithms have been proposed for protecting the locationprivacy of mobile users. In this paper; we consider the scenario where different location-based query requests are continuously issued by mobile users while they are moving. Weshow that most of the existing k-anonymity location cloaking algorithms are concerned withsnapshot user locations only and cannot effectively prevent location-dependent attackswhen users' locations are continuously updated. Therefore; adopting both the location k-anonymity and cloaking granularity as privacy metrics; we propose a new incremental clique-based cloaking algorithm; called ICliqueCloak; to defend against location-dependentattacks. The main idea is to incrementally maintain maximal cliques needed for location …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,161
Performance evaluation of an optimal cache replacement policy for wireless data dissemination,Jianliang Xu; Qinglong Hu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Data caching at mobile clients is an important technique for improving the performance ofwireless data dissemination systems. However; variable data sizes; data updates; limitedclient resources; and frequent client disconnections make cache management a challenge.We propose a gain-based cache replacement policy; Min-SAUD; for wireless datadissemination when cache consistency must be enforced before a cached item is used. Min-SAUD considers several factors that affect cache performance; namely; access probability;update frequency; data size; retrieval delay; and cache validation cost. The paper employsstretch as the major performance metric since it accounts for the data service time and; thus;is fair when items have different sizes. We prove that Min-SAUD achieves optimal stretchunder some standard assumptions. Moreover; a series of simulation experiments have …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,158
QoS-aware replica placement for content distribution,Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu,The rapid growth of new information services and business-oriented applications entails theconsideration of quality of service (QoS) in content distribution. This paper investigates theQoS-aware replica placement problems for responsiveness QoS requirements. We considertwo classes of service models: replica-aware services and replica-blind services. In replica-aware services; the servers are aware of the locations of replicas and can therefore optimizerequest routing to improve responsiveness. We show that the QoS-aware placementproblem for replica-aware services is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms for fastcomputation of good solutions are proposed and experimentally evaluated. In replica-blindservices; the servers are not aware of the locations of replicas or even their existence. As aresult; each replica only serves the requests flowing through it under some given routing …,IEEE Transactions on parallel and distributed systems,2005,144
Placement problems for transparent data replication proxy services,Jianliang Xu; Bo Li; Dik Lun Lee,Transparent data replication has been considered a promising technique for improvingsystem performance for a large distributed network. In this paper; a hybrid transparentreplication model is presented. We address the problems of replication proxy placement inthe network and data replica placement on the installed proxies given that a maximum of Mproxies are allowed. Both reads and writes are considered in these problems. Theperformance objective is to minimize the total data transfer cost. To address the placementproblems; we first present the optimal solutions for a single object in a tree networkwithout/with constraint on the number of replicas. Based on that; two schemes; namely;aggregate access (AGGA) and weighted popularity (WPOP); are proposed for the replicationproxy placement problem. An optimal solution is described for the replica placement …,IEEE Journal on Selected areas in Communications,2002,132
Performance analysis of location-dependent cache invalidation schemes for mobile environments,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Dik Lun Lee,Mobile location-dependent information services are gaining increasing interest in bothacademic and industrial communities. In these services; data values depend on theirlocations. Caching frequently accessed data on mobile clients can help save wirelessbandwidth and improve system performance. However; since client location changesconstantly; location-dependent data may become obsolete not only due to updatesperformed on data items but also because of client movements across the network. To thebest of the authors' knowledge; previous work on cache invalidation issues focused on dataupdates only. This paper considers data inconsistency caused by client movements andproposes three location-dependent cache invalidation schemes. The performance for theproposed schemes is investigated by both analytical study and simulation experiments in …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,126
Privacy-conscious location-based queries in mobile environments,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Haibo Hu; Jing Du,In location-based services; users with location-aware mobile devices are able to makequeries about their surroundings anywhere and at any time. While this ubiquitous computingparadigm brings great convenience for information access; it also raises concerns overpotential intrusion into user location privacy. To protect location privacy; one typicalapproach is to cloak user locations into spatial regions based on user-specified privacyrequirements; and to transform location-based queries into region-based queries. In thispaper; we identify and address three new issues concerning this location cloakingapproach. First; we study the representation of cloaking regions and show that a circularregion generally leads to a small result size for region-based queries. Second; we develop amobility-aware location cloaking technique to resist trace analysis attacks. Two cloaking …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,120
Grid-partition index: a hybrid method for nearest-neighbor queries in wireless location-based services,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Traditional nearest-neighbor (NN) search is based on two basic indexingapproaches: object-based indexing and solution-based indexing. The former is constructedbased on the locations of data objects: using some distance heuristics on object locations.The latter is built on a precomputed solution space. Thus; NN queries can be reduced to andprocessed as simple point queries in this solution space. Both approaches exhibit somedisadvantages; especially when employed for wireless data broadcast in mobile computingenvironments. In this paper; we introduce a new index method; called the grid-partitionindex; to support NN search in both on-demand access and periodic broadcast modes ofmobile computing. The grid-partition index is constructed based on the Voronoi diagram; ie;the solution space of NN queries. However; it has two distinctive characteristics. First; it …,The VLDB Journal,2006,115
Processingwindow queries in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Jianliang Xu; Gail Mitchell,The existing query processing techniques for sensor networks rely on a networkinfrastructure for query propagation and data collection. However; such an infrastructure isvery susceptible to network topology transients that widely exist in sensor networks. In thispaper; we propose an infrastructure-free window query processing technique for sensornetworks; called itinerary-based window query execution (IWQE); in which querypropagation and data collection are combined into one single stage and executed along awell-designed itinerary inside a query window. We study the parameters for setting up anitinerary (eg; width and route) and incorporate into IWQE three data collection schemesbased on different performance trade-offs. Finally we demonstrate; by extensive simulations;the superior energy-time efficiency; robustness; and accuracy of IWQE over the current …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Energy efficient index for querying location-dependent data in mobile broadcast environments,Jianliang Xu; Baibua Zheng; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,We are witnessing in recent years growing interest for location-dependent informationservices among mobile users. We examine the issue of processing location-dependentqueries in a mobile broadcast environment. Different from a traditional environment; mobileusers are concerned with not only access latencies but also power conservation. The planarpoint location algorithms and conventional spatial index structures are shown inefficient. Wepropose a new index data structure; called D-tree; for querying location-dependent data inmobile broadcast environments. The basic idea is to index data regions based on thedivisions between them. We describe how to construct the binary D-tree index; how toprocess location-dependent queries based on this index structure; and how to page the D-tree to fit the packet capacity. The performance of the D-tree is evaluated using both …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,108
Fast nearest neighbor search on road networks,Haibo Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries have been extended from Euclidean spaces to roadnetworks. Existing approaches are either based on Dijkstra-like network expansion orNN/distance precomputation. The former may cause an explosive number of node accessesfor sparse datasets because all nodes closer than the NN to the query must be visited. Thelatter; eg; the Voronoi Network Nearest Neighbor (VN 3) approach; can handle sparsedatasets but is inappropriate for medium and dense datasets due to its high precomputationand storage overhead. In this paper; we propose a new approach that indexes the networktopology based on a novel network reduction technique. It simplifies the network byreplacing the graph topology with a set of interconnected tree-based structures calledSPIE's.

A new storage scheme for approximate location queries in object-tracking sensor networks,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Wang-Chien Lee,Energy efficiency is one of the most critical issues in the design of wireless sensor networks.Observing that many sensor applications for object tracking can tolerate a certain degree ofimprecision in the location data of tracked objects; this paper studies precision-constrainedapproximate queries that trade answer precision for energy efficiency. We develop anenergy-conserving approximate storage (EASE) scheme to efficiently answer approximatelocation queries by keeping error-bounded imprecise location data at some designatedstorage node. The data impreciseness is captured by a system parameter called theapproximation radius. We derive the optimal setting of the approximation radius for ourstorage scheme based on the mobility pattern and devise an adaptive algorithm to adjust thesetting when the mobility pattern is not available a priori or is dynamically changing …,IEEE transactions on parallel and distributed systems,2008,93
Exponential index: A parameterized distributed indexing scheme for data on air,Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Xueyan Tang,Abstract Wireless data broadcast has received a lot of attention from industries andacademia in recent years. Access efficiency and energy conservation are two criticalperformance concerns in a wireless data broadcast environment. To improve the efficiencyof energy consumption on mobile devices; traditional disk-based indexing techniques suchas B $^+ $-tree have been extended to index broadcast data on a wireless channel.However; existing designs are mostly based on centralized tree structures. Most of theseindexing techniques are not flexible in the sense that the trade-off between access efficiencyand energy conservation is not adjustable based on application specific requirements. Wepropose in this paper a novel parameterized index; called the exponential index; which canbe tuned to optimize the access latency with the tuning time bounded by a given limit; and …,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Mobile systems; applications; and services,2004,93

Non-exposure location anonymity,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Location cloaking has been proposed and well studied to protect user privacy. It blurs theaccurate user location (ie; a point withcoordinates) and replaces it with a well-shapedcloaked region (usually a circle or a rectangle). However; to obtain such a cloaked region;all existing cloaking algorithms require to know the accurate locations of all users. Sincesuch information is exactly what the user wants to hide; these algorithms can work only if allparties involved in the cloaking process are trusted. However; in practice this assumptionrarely holds as any of these parties could be malicious. Therefore; location cloaking withoutexposing the accurate user location to any party is urgently needed. In this paper; wepresent such a non-exposure cloaking algorithm. It is designed for k-anonymity and cloakingis performed based on the proximity information among mobile users; instead of directly …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Distortion-based anonymity for continuous queries in location-based mobile services,Xiao Pan; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Privacy preservation has recently received considerable attention for location-based mobile services. Various location cloaking approaches have been proposed toprotect the location privacy of mobile users. However; existing cloaking approaches are ill-suited for continuous queries. In view of the privacy disclosure and poor QoS (Quality ofService) under continuous query anonymization; in this paper; we propose a δ p-privacymodel and a δ q-distortion model to balance the tradeoff between user privacy and QoS.Furthermore; two incremental utility-based cloaking algorithms---bottom-up cloaking andhybrid cloaking; are proposed to anonymize continuous queries.

PSGR: priority-based stateless geo-routing in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Jianliang Xu; Gail Mitchell,Volunteer forwarding; as an emerging routing idea for large scale; location-aware wirelesssensor networks; recently has attracted a significant amount of research attention. However;several critical research issues raised by volunteer forwarding; including priority assignment;acknowledgement collisions and communication voids; have not been well addressed bythe existing work. In this paper; we propose a priority-based stateless geo-routing (PSGR)protocol to address these issues. Based on PSGR; sensor nodes are able to locallydetermine their priority to serve as the next relay node using dynamically estimated networkdensity. This effectively suppresses potential communication collisions without prolongingrouting delays.

Proactive caching for spatial queries in mobile environments,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Wing Sing Wong; Baihua Zheng; Dik Lun Lee; W-C Lee,Semantic caching enables mobile clients to answer spatial queries locally by storing thequery descriptions together with the results. However; it supports only a limited number ofquery types; and sharing results among these types is difficult. To address these issues; wepropose a proactive caching model which caches the result objects as well as the index thatsupports these objects as the results. The cached index enables the objects to be reused forall common types of queries. We also propose an adaptive scheme to cache such an index;which further optimizes the query response time for the best user experience. Simulationresults show that proactive caching achieves a significant performance gain over pagecaching and semantic caching in mobile environments where wireless bandwidth andbattery are precious resources.,Data Engineering; 2005.

Adaptive data collection strategies for lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks,Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu,Communication is a primary source of energy consumption in wireless sensor networks.Due to resource constraints; the sensor nodes may not have enough energy to report everyreading to the base station over a required network lifetime. This paper investigates datacollection strategies in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks. Our objective is tomaximize the accuracy of data collected by the base station over the network lifetime.Instead of sending sensor readings periodically; the relative importance of the readings isconsidered in data collection: the sensor nodes send data updates to the base station whenthe new readings differ more substantially from the previous ones. We analyze the optimalupdate strategy and develop adaptive update strategies for both individual and aggregatedata collections.

Optimizing lifetime for continuous data aggregation with precision guarantees in wireless sensor networks,Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu,This paper exploits the tradeoff between data quality and energy consumption to extend thelifetime of wireless sensor networks. To obtain an aggregate form of sensor data withprecision guarantees; the precision constraint is partitioned and allocated to individualsensor nodes in a coordinated fashion. Our key idea is to differentiate the precisions of datacollected from different sensor nodes to balance their energy consumption. Three factorsaffecting the lifetime of sensor nodes are identified: 1) the changing pattern of sensorreadings; 2) the residual energy of sensor nodes; and 3) the communication cost betweenthe sensor nodes and the base station.

The D-tree: An index structure for planar point queries in location-based wireless services,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Location-based services (LBSs); considered as a killer application in the wireless datamarket; provide information based on locations specified in the queries. In this paper; weexamine the indexing issue for querying location-dependent data in wireless LBSs; inparticular; we focus on an important class of queries; planar point queries. To address theissues of responsiveness; energy consumption; and bandwidth contention in wirelesscommunications; an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storageoverhead. It is shown that the traditional point-location algorithms and spatial indexstructures fail to achieve either objective or both. This paper proposes a new index structure;called D-tree; which indexes spatial regions based on the divisions that form the boundariesof the regions.

Authenticating location-based services without compromising location privacy,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Qian Chen; Ziwei Yang,Abstract The popularity of mobile social networking services (mSNSs) is propelling moreand more businesses; especially those in retailing and marketing; into mobile and location-based forms. To address the trust issue; the service providers are expected to deliver theirlocation-based services in an authenticatable manner; so that the correctness of the serviceresults can be verified by the client. However; existing works on query authentication cannotpreserve the privacy of the data being queried; which are sensitive user locations when itcomes to location-based services and mSNSs. In this paper; we address this challengingproblem by proposing a comprehensive solution that preserves unconditional locationprivacy when authenticating range queries.

SAIU: An efficient cache replacement policy for wireless on-demand broadcasts,Jianliang Xu; Qinglong Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,ABSTRACT In a wireless communication environment; on-demand broadcasting is anattractive information delivery method; while data caching is an important technique used toimprove system performance. However; most of the wireless data caching techniques in theliterature were designed for pushbased broadcast systems. Due to variable item sizes; dataupdates and frequent client disconnections; the design of client cache management in an on-demand broadcast system becomes a challenge.

LIGHT: a query-efficient yet low-maintenance indexing scheme over DHTs,Yuzhe Tang; Shuigeng Zhou; Jianliang Xu,DHT is a widely used building block for scalable P2P systems. However; as uniform hashingemployed in DHTs destroys data locality; it is not a trivial task to support complex queries(eg; range queries and k-nearest-neighbor queries) in DHT-based P2P systems. In order tosupport efficient processing of such complex queries; a popular solution is to build indexeson top of the DHT. Unfortunately; existing over-DHT indexing schemes suffer from eitherquery inefficiency or high maintenance cost. In this paper; we propose LIGhtweight HashTree (LIGHT)-a query-efficient yet low-maintenance indexing scheme. LIGHT employs anovel naming mechanism and a tree summarization strategy for graceful distribution of itsindex structure.

PCMLogging: optimizing transaction logging and recovery performance with PCM,Shen Gao; Jianliang Xu; Theo Härder; Bingsheng He; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Phase-change memory (PCM); as one of the most promising next-generation memorytechnologies; offers various attractive properties such as non-volatility; byte addressability;bit alterability; and low idle energy consumption. Recently; PCM has drawn much attentionfrom the database community for optimizing query and transaction performance. As acomplement to existing work; we present PCMLogging; a novel logging scheme that exploitsPCM for both data caching and transaction logging to minimize I/O accesses in disk-baseddatabases. Specifically; PCMLogging caches dirty pages/records in PCM and furthermaintains an implicit log in the cached updates to support database recovery.

Cache coherency in location-dependent information services for mobile environment,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Dik Lun Lee; Qinglong Hu,Abstract Caching frequently accessed data at the client is an attractive technique forimproving access time. In a mobile computing environment; client location becomes a pieceof changing information. As such; location-dependent data may become obsolete due todata updates or client movements. Most of the previous work investigated cache invalidationissues related to data updates only; whereas few considered data inconsistency caused byclient movements. This paper separates location-dependent data invalidation fromtraditional cache invalidation. For location-dependent invalidation; several approaches areproposed and their performance is studied by a set of simulation experiments. The resultsshow that the proposed methods substantially outperform the NSI scheme which drops thecache contents entirely when hand-off.,International Conference on Mobile Data Access,1999,47
Quality aware privacy protection for location-based services,Zhen Xiao; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Protection of users' privacy has been a central issue for location-based services(LBSs). In this paper; we classify two kinds of privacy protection requirements in LBS:location anonymity and identifier anonymity. While the location cloaking technique under thek-anonymity model can provide a good protection of users' privacy; it reduces the resolutionof location information and; hence; may degrade the quality of service (QoS). To strike abalance between the location privacy and QoS; we present a quality-aware anonymitymodel for protecting location privacy while meeting user specified QoS requirements. In themodel; a mobile user can specify the minimum anonymity level requirement upon locationprivacy as well as the maximum cloaking latency and the maximum cloaking region sizerequirements upon QoS. In accordance with the model; we develop an efficient directed …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,46
Proxy cache management for fine-grained scalable video streaming,Jiangchuan Liu; Xiaowen Chu; Jianliang Xu,Caching video objects at proxies close to clients has attracted a lot of attention in recentyears. To meet diverse client bandwidth conditions; there have been research efforts tocombine proxy caching with video layering or transcoding. Nevertheless; these adaptivesystems suffer from either coarse adaptation granularity due to the inflexible structures ofexisting layered coders or high computation overhead due to the transcoding operations.

Privacy-aware location data publishing,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Sai Tung On; Jing Du; Joseph Kee-Yin Ng,Abstract This article examines a new problem of k-anonymity with respect to a referencedataset in privacy-aware location data publishing: given a user dataset and a sensitive eventdataset; we want to generalize the user dataset such that by joining it with the event datasetthrough location; each event is covered by at least k users. Existing k-anonymity algorithmsgeneralize every k user locations to the same vague value; regardless of the events.Therefore; they tend to overprotect against the privacy compromise and make the publisheddata less useful. In this article; we propose a new generalization paradigm called localenlargement; as opposed to conventional hierarchy-or partition-based generalization. Localenlargement guarantees that user locations are enlarged just enough to cover all events ktimes; and thus maximize the usefulness of the published data. We develop an O (H n) …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,44
PAM: an efficient and privacy-aware monitoring framework for continuously moving objects,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Efficiency and privacy are two fundamental issues in moving object monitoring. This paperproposes a privacy-aware monitoring (PAM) framework that addresses both issues. Theframework distinguishes itself from the existing work by being the first to holistically addressthe issues of location updating in terms of monitoring accuracy; efficiency; and privacy;particularly; when and how mobile clients should send location updates to the server. Basedon the notions of safe region and most probable result; PAM performs location updates onlywhen they would likely alter the query results. Furthermore; by designing various clientupdate strategies; the framework is flexible and able to optimize accuracy; privacy; orefficiency. We develop efficient query evaluation/reevaluation and safe region computationalgorithms in the framework. The experimental results show that PAM substantially …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2010,44
A cloaking algorithm based on spatial networks for location privacy,Po-Yi Li; Wen-Chih Peng; Tsung-Wei Wang; Wei-Shinn Ku; Jianliang Xu; John A Hamilton Jr,Most of research efforts have elaborated on k-anonymity for location privacy. The generalarchitecture for implementing k-anonymity is that there is one trusted server (referred to aslocation anonymizer) responsible for cloaking at least k users' locations for protectinglocation privacy. A location anonymizer will generate cloaked regions in which there are atleast k users for query processing. Prior works only explore grid shape cloaked regions.However; grid shape cloaked regions result in a considerable amount of query results;thereby increasing the overhead of filtering unwanted query results. In this paper; wepropose a cloaking algorithm in which cloaked regions are generated according to thefeatures of spatial networks. By exploring the features of spatial networks; the cloakedregions are very efficient for reducing query results and improving cache utilization of …,Sensor Networks; Ubiquitous and Trustworthy Computing; 2008.

Analysis of TTL-based consistency in unstructured peer-to-peer networks,Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Consistency maintenance is important to the sharing of dynamic contents in peer-to-peer(P2P) networks. The TTL-based mechanism is a natural choice for maintaining freshness inP2P content sharing. This paper investigates TTL-based consistency maintenance inunstructured P2P networks. In this approach; each replica is assigned an expiration timebeyond which the replica stops serving new requests unless it is validated. While TTL-basedconsistency is widely explored in many client-server applications; there has been no studyon TTL-based consistency in P2P networks. Our main contribution is an analytical modelthat studies the search performance and the freshness of P2P content sharing under TTL-based consistency. Due to the random nature of request routing; P2P networks arefundamentally different from most existing TTL-based systems in that every node with a …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2008,43
Authenticating location-based skyline queries in arbitrary subspaces,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Wang-Chien Lee,With the ever-increasing use of smartphones and tablet devices; location-based services(LBSs) have experienced explosive growth in the past few years. To scale up services; therehas been a rising trend of outsourcing data management to Cloud service providers; whichprovide query services to clients on behalf of data owners. However; in this data-outsourcingmodel; the service provider can be untrustworthy or compromised; thereby returningincorrect or incomplete query results to clients; intentionally or not. Therefore; empoweringclients to authenticate query results is imperative for outsourced databases. In this paper; westudy the authentication problem for location-based arbitrary-subspace skyline queries(LASQs); which represent an important class of LBS applications.

p-sensitivity: A semantic privacy-protection model for location-based services,Zhen Xiao; Jianliang Xu; Xiaofeng Meng,Several methods have been proposed to support location-based services without revealingmobile users' privacy information. There are two types of privacy concerns in location-basedservices: location privacy and query privacy. Existing work; based on location k-anonymity;mainly focused on location privacy and are insufficient to protect query privacy. In particular;due to lack of semantics; location k-anonymity suffers from query homogeneity attack. In thispaper; we introduce p-sensitivity; a novel privacy-protection model that considers querydiversity and semantic information in anonymizing user locations. We propose a PE-Tree forimplementing the p-sensitivity model. Search algorithms and heuristics are developed toefficiently find the optimal p-sensitivity anonymization in the tree.

Nearby friend alert: Location anonymity in mobile geosocial networks,Hong Ping Li; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Mobile geosocial networking services could be the killer app for next-generation mobilecomputing. However; the privacy issue--in particular; location privacy--has both users andgovernment authors concerned. The authors address this issue for the" nearby friend alert"service; common in mobile geosocial networks. They review representative works on privacy-preserving proximity detection and present a new quantitative solution. They adopt the grid-and-hashing paradigm and develop optimal grid overlay and multilevel grids to increase thedetection accuracy while saving the wireless bandwidth. Based on these techniques; theydevise the client-side location update scheme and the server-side update handlingprocedure for continuous proximity detection. Simulation results show that their approach isefficient and scalable under various system parameters and user moving speeds.,IEEE Pervasive Computing,2013,40
Differentially private high-dimensional data publication via sampling-based inference,Rui Chen; Qian Xiao; Yu Zhang; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Releasing high-dimensional data enables a wide spectrum of data mining tasks.Yet; individual privacy has been a major obstacle to data sharing. In this paper; we considerthe problem of releasing high-dimensional data with differential privacy guarantees. Wepropose a novel solution to preserve the joint distribution of a high-dimensional dataset. Wefirst develop a robust sampling-based framework to systematically explore thedependencies among all attributes and subsequently build a dependency graph. Thisframework is coupled with a generic threshold mechanism to significantly improve accuracy.We then identify a set of marginal tables from the dependency graph to approximate the jointdistribution based on the solid inference foundation of the junction tree algorithm whileminimizing the resultant error.

Energy-conserving air indexes for nearest neighbor search,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract A location-based service (LBS) provides information based on the locationinformation specified in a query. Nearest-neighbor (NN) search is an important class ofqueries supported in LBSs. This paper studies energy-conserving air indexes for NN searchin a wireless broadcast environment. Linear access requirement of wireless broadcastweakens the performance of existing search algorithms designed for traditional spatialdatabase. In this paper; we propose a new energy-conserving index; called grid-partitionindex; which enables a single linear scan of the index for any NN queries. The idea is topartition the search space for NN queries into grid cells and index all the objects that arepotential nearest neighbors of a query point in each grid cell. Three grid partition schemesare proposed for the grid-partition index. Performance of the proposed grid-partition …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,39
Optimizing nonindexed join processing in flash storage-based systems,Yu Li; Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Flash memory-based disks (or simply flash disks) have been widely used in today'scomputer systems. With their continuously increasing capacity and dropping price; it isenvisioned that some database systems will operate on flash disks in the near future.However; the I/O characteristics of flash disks are different from those of magnetic hard disks.Motivated by this; we study the core of query processing in row-based database systems-join processing-on flash storage media. More specifically; we propose a new framework;called DigestJoin; to optimize nonindexed join processing by reducing the intermediateresult size and exploiting fast random reads of flash disks. DigestJoin consists of twophases: 1) projecting the join attributes followed by a join on the projected attributes; and 2)fetching the full tuples that satisfy the join to produce the final join results.

Answering why-not questions on spatial keyword top-k queries,Lei Chen; Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Christian S Jensen; Jianliang Xu,Large volumes of geo-tagged text objects are available on the web. Spatial keyword top-kqueries retrieve k such objects with the best score according to a ranking function that takesinto account a query location and query keywords. In this setting; users may wonder whysome known object is unexpectedly missing from a result; and understanding why may aidusers in retrieving better results. While spatial keyword querying has been studiedintensively; no proposals exist for how to offer users explanations of why such expectedobjects are missing from results. We provide techniques that allow the revision of spatialkeyword queries such that their results include one or more desired; but missing objects. Indoing so; we adopt a query refinement approach to provide a basic algorithm that reducesthe problem to a two-dimensional geometrical problem.

Range-based skyline queries in mobile environments,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Skyline query processing for location-based services; which considers both spatial andnonspatial attributes of the objects being queried; has recently received increasing attention.Existing solutions focus on solving point-or line-based skyline queries; in which the querylocation is an exact location point or a line segment. However; due to privacy concerns andlimited precision of localization devices; the input of a user location is often a spatial range.This paper studies a new problem of how to process such range-based skyline queries. Twonovel algorithms are proposed: one is index-based (I-SKY) and the other is not based onany index (N-SKY). To handle frequent movements of the objects being queried; we alsopropose incremental versions of I-SKY and N-SKY; which avoid recomputing the queryindex and results from scratch. Additionally; we develop efficient solutions for probabilistic …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,36
PcarnBase: Development of a transcriptomic database for the brain coral Platygyra carnosus,Jin Sun; Qian Chen; Janice CY Lun; Jianliang Xu; Jian-Wen Qiu,Abstract The aims of this study were to sequence the transcriptome and organize thesequence data into a searchable database for the brain coral Platygyra carnosus; a structure-forming dominant species along the coast of southern China. We collected healthy andtumorous coral tissues from two locations; extracted RNA from each tissue sample; pooledthe RNA from all tissue samples; generated a cDNA library from the pooled samples; andconducted paired-end sequencing of the cDNA library using the Illumina platform to produce59.6 M clean sequences with a read length of 90 bp. De novo assembly of the sequencedata resulted in 162;468 unigenes with an average length of 606 bp (range; 201 to 23;923bp). This is the largest transcriptome dataset for a species of coral whose genome has notbeen sequenced. A BLASTx search against the NCBI protein database showed that …,Marine biotechnology,2013,34
2PASS: Bandwidth-optimized location cloaking for anonymous location-based services,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Protection of users' location privacy is a critical issue for location-based services. Locationcloaking has been proposed to blur users' accurate locations with cloaked regions. Althoughvarious cloaking algorithms have been studied; none of the prior work has explored theimpact of cloaking on the bandwidth usage of requested services. In this paper; we developan innovative result-aware location cloaking approach; called 2PASS. Based on the notionof Voronoi cells; 2PASS minimizes the number of objects to request; and hence; thebandwidth while meeting the same privacy requirement. The core component of 2PASS is alightweight WAG-tree index; based on which efficient and secure client and serverprocedures are designed. Through threat analysis and experimental results; we argue that2PASS is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various metrics …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,34
A cross pruning framework for top-k data collection in wireless sensor networks,Xingjie Liu; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Energy conservation is a key issue for algorithm designs in wireless sensor networks. In thispaper; we explore in-network aggregation techniques for answering top-k queries inwireless sensor networks. A top-k query retrieves the k data objects with the highest scoresevaluated by a scoring function on interested features of sensor readings. Our study showsthat existing techniques for processing top-k query; eg; Tiny AGgregation Service (TAG); arenot energy efficient due to deficiencies in their routing structures and data aggregationmechanisms. To address these deficiencies; we propose to develop a new cross pruning(XP) aggregation framework for top-k data collection in wireless sensor networks. The XPframework incorporates several novel ideas to facilitate efficient in-network aggregation andfiltering; including 1) building a cluster-tree routing structure to aggregate more objects …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,32
Processing precision-constrained approximate queries in wireless sensor networks,Minji Wu; Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang,A lot of research efforts have been devoted to improving energy efficiency for wirelesssensor networks by exploring distributed data storage and in-network query processingtechniques. In this paper; we present a generic two-tier data storage strategy for answeringprecision-constrained approximate queries in a sensor network. The basic idea is to keeptwo versions of data in the network. A highprecision version is kept at the sensor node thatcaptures the data while a low-precision version is maintained at the base station. Wedevelop query processing and node refreshment strategies for various types of approximatequeries under the two-tier storage. Our extensive experiments show that the two-tier storagestrategy outperforms the basic centralized storage scheme by an order of magnitude interms of network lifetime under various system configur,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

OSRI: A rotationally invariant binary descriptor,Xianwei Xu; Lu Tian; Jianjiang Feng; Jie Zhou,Binary descriptors are becoming widely used in computer vision field because of their highmatching efficiency and low memory requirements. Since conventional approaches; whichfirst compute a floating-point descriptor then binarize it; are computationally expensive;some recent efforts have focused on directly computing binary descriptors from local imagepatches. Although these binary descriptors enable a significant speedup in processing time;their performances usually drop a lot due to orientation estimation errors and limiteddescription abilities. To address these issues; we propose a novel binary descriptor basedon the ordinal and spatial information of regional invariants (OSRIs) over a rotation invariantsampling pattern. Our main contributions are twofold: 1) each bit in OSRI is computed basedon difference tests of regional invariants over pairwise sampling-regions instead of …,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2014,29
Towards accurate histogram publication under differential privacy,Xiaojian Zhang; Rui Chen; Jianliang Xu; Xiaofeng Meng; Yingtao Xie,Abstract Histograms are the workhorse of data mining and analysis. This paper considersthe problem of publishing histograms under differential privacy; one of the strongest privacymodels. Existing differentially private histogram publication schemes have shown thatclustering (or grouping) is a promising idea to improve the accuracy of sanitized histograms.However; none of them fully exploits the benefit of clustering. In this paper; we introduce anew clustering framework. It features a sophisticated evaluation of the trade-off between theapproximation error due to clustering and the Laplace error due to Laplace noise injected;which is normally overlooked in prior work. In particular; we propose three clusteringstrategies with different orders of run-time complexities. We prove the superiority of ourapproach by theoretical utility comparisons with the competitors.

Lazy-update b+-tree for flash devices,Sai Tung On; Haibo Hu; Yu Li; Jianliang Xu,With the rapid increasing capacity of flash chips; flash-aware indexing techniques are highlydesirable for flash devices. The unique features of flash memory; such as the erase-before-write constraint and the asymmetric read/write cost; severely deteriorate the performance ofthe traditional B+-tree algorithm. In this paper; we propose a new indexing method; calledlazy-update B+-tree; to overcome the limitations of flash memory. The basic idea is to deferthe time of committing update requests to the B+-tree by buffering them in a segment of mainmemory. They are later committed in groups so that each write operation can be amortizedby a bunch of update requests. We identify a victim selection problem for the lazy-update B+-tree and develop two heuristic-based commit policies to address the problem. Simulationresults show that the proposed lazy-update method; along with a well-designed commit …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

At room temperature and pressure up to 3 GPa; single-crystal quartzand eclogite were used to provide samples under test; respectively. The results of this workagree with the previous measurements very well within the error range.

In such newapplications; realtime data analysis such as clustering analysis is becoming one of the mostimportant requirements. In this paper; we present the problem of clustering moving objects inspatial networks and propose a unified framework to address this problem. Due to the innatefeature of continuously changing positions of moving objects; the clustering resultsdynamically change. By exploiting the unique features of road networks; our framework firstintroduces a notion of cluster block (CB) as the underlying clustering unit. We then divide theclustering process into the continuous maintenance of CBs and periodical construction ofclusters with different criteria based on CBs.

Flag commit: Supporting efficient transaction recovery in flash-based dbmss,Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu; Bingsheng He,Owing to recent advances in semiconductor technologies; flash disks have been acompetitive alternative to traditional magnetic disks as external storage media. In this paper;we study how transaction recovery can be efficiently supported in database managementsystems (dbmss) running on slc flash disks. Inspired by the classical shadow-pagingapproach; we propose a new commit scheme; called flagcommit; to exploit the uniquecharacteristics of flash disks such as fast random read access; out-place updating; andpartial page programming. To minimize the need of writing log records; we embed thetransaction status into flash pages through a chain of commit flags. Based on flagcommit; wedevelop two recovery protocols; namely commit-based flag commit (cfc) and abort-basedflag commit (afc); to meet different performance needs.

On bandwidth allocation for data dissemination in cellular mobile networks,Jianliang Xu; Dik L Lee; Bo Li,Abstract Wireless bandwidth is a scarce resource in a cellular mobile network. As such; it isimportant to effectively allocate bandwidth to each cell such that the overall systemperformance is optimized. Channel allocation strategies have been extensively studied forvoice communications in cellular networks. However; for data dissemination applications;studies on bandwidth allocation have thus far been limited to a single-cell environment. Thispaper investigates the problem of bandwidth allocation for data dissemination in a multi-cellenvironment; which; to the best of our knowledge; has not been investigated before. Theperformance objective is to minimize the overall expected access latency given the workloadfor each cell in a data dissemination system.

We advocate the indexing approach thatsuperimposes a multidimensional index tree on top of a DHT-a paradigm that keeps theunderlying DHT intact while being able to adapt to any DHT substrate. In this context; weidentify several index design issues and propose a novel indexing scheme calledmultidimensional Lightweight Hash Tree (m-LIGHT). First; to preserve data locality; m-LIGHTemploys a clever naming mechanism that gracefully maps a tree-based index into the DHTand contributes to high efficiency in both index maintenance and query processing.

Towards efficient authenticated subgraph query service in outsourced graph databases,Zhe Fan; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Graphs are powerful tools suitable for a large variety of applications including chemicaldatabases and the Semantic Web; among others. A fundamental query of graph databasesis the subgraph query: given a query graph q; it retrieves the data graphs from a databasethat contain q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with the computationalhardness of subgraph query processing; outsourcing the processing to a third-party serviceprovider is an appealing alternative. However; security properties such as data integrity andthe response time are critical Quality of Service (QoS) issues in query services.Unfortunately; to our knowledge; authenticated subgraph query services have not beenaddressed before.

Private search on key-value stores with hierarchical indexes,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xizhong Xu; Kexin Pei; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Query processing that preserves both the query privacy at the client and the data privacy atthe server is a new research problem. It has many practical applications; especially whenthe queries are about the sensitive attributes of records. However; most existing studies;including those originating from data outsourcing; address the data privacy and queryprivacy separately. Although secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a suitable computingparadigm for this problem; it has significant computation and communication overheads;thus unable to scale up to large datasets. Fortunately; recent advances in cryptography bringus two relevant tools-conditional oblivious transfer and homomorphic encryption. In thispaper; we integrate database indexing techniques with these tools in the context of privatesearch on key-value stores.

Authentication of moving top-k spatial keyword queries,Dingming Wu; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,A moving top-k spatial keyword (MkSK) query; which takes into account a continuouslymoving query location; enables a mobile client to be continuously aware of the top-k spatialweb objects that best match a query with respect to location and text relevance. Theincreasing mobile use of the web and the proliferation of geo-positioning render it of interestto consider a scenario where spatial keyword search is outsourced to a separate serviceprovider capable at handling the voluminous spatial web objects available from varioussources. A key challenge is that the service provider may return inaccurate or incorrect queryresults (intentionally or not); eg; due to cost considerations or invasion of hackers.

Document visualization on small displays,Ka Kit Hoi; Dik Lun Lee; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Limitation in display size and resolution on mobile devices is one of the mainobstacles for wide-spread use of web applications in a wireless environment. Web pagesare often too large for a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) screen to present. The sameproblem exists for devices with low resolution such as WebTV. Manual reconstruction of webpages for these devices would ease the problem; however; the large variation of displaycapabilities will greatly increase the burden of web page designers since they have tocustomize a web page for each possible display device. In this paper; we propose adocument segmentation and presentation system. The system automatically divides a webdocument into a number of logical segments based on the screen size and the structure andcontent of the document. Additional information such as overviews and summaries is also …,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2003,17
Real-time in-memory checkpointing for future hybrid memory systems,Shen Gao; Bingsheng He; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In this paper; we study real-time in-memory checkpointing as an effective means toimprove the reliability of future large-scale parallel processing systems. Under this context;the checkpoint overhead can become a significant performance bottleneck. Novel memorysystem designs with upcoming non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) technologiesare emerging to address this performance issue. However; we find that those designs canstill have prohibitively high checkpoint overhead and system downtime; especially whencheckpoints are taken frequently to implement a reliable system. In this paper; we propose anovel in-memory checkpointing system; named Mona; for reducing the checkpoint overheadof hybrid memory systems with NVRAM and DRAM. To minimize the in-memory checkpointoverhead; Mona dynamically writes partial checkpoints from DRAM to NVRAM during …,Proceedings of the 29th ACM on International Conference on Supercomputing,2015,16
Mobile filtering for error-bounded data collection in sensor networks,Dan Wang; Jianliang Xu; Jiangchuan Liu; Feng Wang,In wireless sensor networks; filters; which suppress data update reports within predefinederror bounds; effectively reduce the traffic volume for continuous data collection. All priorfilter designs; however; are stationary in the sense that each filter is attached to a specificsensor node and remains stationary over its lifetime. In this paper; we propose mobile filter;a novel design that explores migration of filters to maximize overall traffic reduction. A mobilefilter moves upstream along the data collection path; with its residual size being updatedaccording to the collected data. Intuitively; this migration extracts and relays unused filters;leading to more proactive suppressing of update reports. We start by presenting an optimalfilter migration algorithm for a chain topology. The algorithm is then extended to generalmulti-chain and tree topologies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that; for both synthetic …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08. The 28th International Conference on,2008,16
Caching complementary space for location-based services,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel client-side; multi-granularity caching scheme;called “Complementary Space Caching”(CS caching); for location-based services in mobileenvironments. Different from conventional data caching schemes that only cache a portion ofdataset; CS caching maintains a global view of the whole dataset. Different portions of thisview are cached in varied granularity based on the probabilities of being accessed in thefuture queries. The data objects with very high access probabilities are cached in the finestgranularity; ie; the data objects themselves. The data objects which are less likely to beaccessed in the near future are abstracted and logically cached in the form ofcomplementary regions (CRs) in a coarse granularity. CS caching naturally supports alltypes of location-based queries. In this paper; we explore several design and system …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,15
Authenticated subgraph similarity searchin outsourced graph databases,Yun Peng; Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Subgraph similarity search is used in graph databases to retrieve graphs whose subgraphsare similar to a given query graph. It has been proven successful in a wide range ofapplications including bioinformatics and chem-informatics; etc. Due to the cost of providingefficient similarity search services on ever-increasing graph data; database outsourcing isapparently an appealing solution to database owners. Unfortunately; query serviceproviders may be untrusted or compromised by attacks. To our knowledge; no studies havebeen carried out on the authentication of the search. In this paper; we proposeauthentication techniques that follow the popular filtering-and-verification framework. Wepropose an authentication-friendly metric index called GMTree. Specifically; we transformthe similarity search into a search in a graph metric space and derive small verification …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,14

StableBuffer: optimizing write performance for DBMS applications on flash devices,Yu Li; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Abstract Flash devices have been widely used in embedded systems; laptop computers; andenterprise servers. However; the poor random writes have been an obstacle to running write-intensive DBMS applications on flash devices. In this paper; we exploit the recentlydiscovered; efficient write patterns of flash devices to optimize the performance of DBMSapplications. Specifically; motivated by a focused write pattern; we propose to write pagestemporarily to a small; pre-allocated storage space on the flash device; called StableBuffer;instead of directly writing to their actual destinations. We then recognize and flush efficientwrite patterns of the buffer to achieve a better write performance. In contrast to prior log-based techniques; our StableBuffer solution does not require modifying the driver of flashdevices and hence works well for commodity flash devices. We discuss the detailed …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,14

FD-buffer: a buffer manager for databases on flash disks,Sai Tung On; Yinan Li; Bingsheng He; Ming Wu; Qiong Luo; Jianliang Xu,Abstract We design and implement FD-Buffer; a buffer manager for database systemsrunning on flash-based disks. Unlike magnetic disks; flash media has an inherent read-writeasymmetry: writes involve expensive erase operations and as a result are usually muchslower than reads. Therefore; we address this asymmetry in FD-Buffer. Specifically; we usethe average I/O cost per page access as opposed to the traditional miss rate as theperformance metric for a buffer. We develop a new replacement policy in which we separateclean and dirty pages into two pools. The size ratio of the two pools is automatically adaptedto the read-write asymmetry and the runtime workload. We evaluate FD-Buffer with trace-driven experiments on real flash disks. Our evaluation results show that our algorithmachieves up to 33% improvement on the overall performance on commodity flash disks; in …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,13
A series of models of non-thermal high voltage electrical injuries,Wei-Ping Li; Mei-Shu Zhu; Zhi-Xiang Zhu; Jin-Chao Guan; Xiao-Guang Xu,Abstract Although many models of electrical injury have been established; none of them arecompletely typical of the clinical features of electrical injury. As a result; research based onthese models were incapable of explaining many clinical phenomena such as continuoustissue necrosis and also were unable to cope with high ratio of amputation of extremities. Inorder to investigate the mechanism of electrical injuries and better model the condition withsimilar clinical characteristics we developed a new model. Seventy-five New Zealand rabbitswere employed in this study; of them 45 were used in a preliminary experiment including theselection of the size of electrode plate area; damaged extent; time length of electrical injuryand interval length between two injuries and so on. Another 30 rabbits were equally dividedinto five groups with electrical injury times of 6; 12; 18; 24 and 30 cycles; respectively …,Burns,2006,13
Research challenges in information access and dissemination in a mobile environment,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; Manli Zhu; Dik Lun Lee,ABSTRACT A wireless environment has both benefits and limitations when it is used as amedium for information access and dissemination. In a wireless environment; we can accessto not only information anytime and anywhere as if we were connected to the Internet butinformation tailored to our particular needs depending on where we are located. This leadsto location-dependent information services (eg; querying for local traffic; restaurants; etc.).The capability of the system is also enhanced by the fact that genuine broadcast (asopposed to multicast) can be realized in a wireless environment; making massive broadcastof commonly requested data a simple and inexpensive task. On the other hand; we have toovercome a lot of limitations such as the limited bandwidth; high-cost of data transmission(both in terms of power consumption on the client devices and system bandwidth).

Study of GFRP steel buckling restraint braces,Kailai Deng; Peng Pan; Xin Nie; Xiaoguang Xu; Peng Feng; Lieping Ye,Abstract Buckling-restraint braces (BRBs) are used extensively in seismic-resistantstructures. They consist of a core energy dissipation and external restraining component. Anovel glass fiber–reinforced polymer (GFRP) steel BRB is proposed. In the GFRP steel BRB;four GFRP pultruded tubes; which are tied together by GFRP wrapping layers; are used torestrict core steel component buckling instead of conventional steel tube and infilledconcrete or mortar. This GFRP steel BRB is extremely lightweight. Techniques formanufacturing GFRP steel BRB were developed for convenient large-scale industrializedproduction. Quasi-static tests were carried out to validate the performance of the GFRP steelBRB under cyclic loading. The tests focused mainly on energy dissipation capacity andultimate failure mode of the proposed GFRP steel BRB. The effect of applying additional …,Journal of Composites for Construction,2015,12
Spatial-aware interest group queries in location-based social networks,Yafei Li; Dingming Wu; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Weifeng Su,Abstract With the recent advances in positioning and smartphone technologies; a number ofsocial networks such as Twitter; Foursquare and Facebook are acquiring the dimension oflocation; thus bridging the gap between the physical world and online social networkingservices. Most of the location-based social networks released check-in services that allowusers to share their visiting locations with their friends. In this paper; users' interests aremodeled by check-in actions. We propose a new type of Spatial-aware Interest Group (SIG)query that retrieves a user group of size k where each user is interested in the querykeywords and they are close to each other in the Euclidean space. We prove that the SIGquery problem is NP-complete. A family of efficient algorithms based on the IR-tree is thusproposed for the processing of SIG queries.

Flash-optimized B+-tree,Sai Tung On; Haibo Hu; Yu Li; Jianliang Xu,Abstract With the rapid increasing capacity of flash memory; flash-aware indexingtechniques are highly desirable for flash devices. The unique features of flash memory; suchas the erase-before-write constraint and the asymmetric read/write cost; severely deterioratethe performance of the traditional B+-tree algorithm. In this paper; we propose an optimizedindexing method; called lazy-update B+-tree; to overcome the limitations of flash memory.The basic idea is to defer the committing of update requests to the B+-tree by buffering themin a segment of main memory. They are later committed in groups so that the cost of eachwrite operation can be amortized by a bunch of update requests. We identify a victimselection problem for the lazy-update B+-tree and develop two heuristic-based commitpolicies to address this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed lazy-update …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2010,12
Fine-grained scalable video caching for heterogeneous clients,Jianliang Liu; Jianliang Xu; Xiaowen Chu,Much research has focused on caching adaptive videos to improve system performance forheterogeneous clients with diverse access bandwidths. However; existing rate-adaptivecaching systems; which are based on layered coding or transcoding; often suffer from acoarse adaptation and/or a high computation overhead. In this paper; we propose aninnovative rate-adaptive caching framework that enables low-cost and fine-grainedadaptation by using MPEG-4 fine-grained scalable videos. The proposed framework is bothnetwork-aware and media-adaptive; ie; the clients can be of heterogeneous streaming rates;and the backbone bandwidth consumption can be adaptively controlled. We developefficient cache management schemes to determine the best contents to cache and theoptimal streaming rate to each client under the framework.

We previously found that mutations in TUBB8 caused oocytematuration arrest. The objective was to describe newly discovered mutations in TUBB8 andto characterise the accompanying spectrum of phenotypes and modes of inheritance.Methods and results Patients with oocyte maturation arrest were sequenced with respect toTUBB8. We investigated the effects of identified mutations in vitro; in cultured cells and inmouse oocytes. Seven heterozygous missense and two homozygous mutations wereidentified. These mutations cause a range of folding defects in vitro; different degrees ofmicrotubule disruption upon expression in cultured cells and interfere to varying extents inthe proper assembly of the meiotic spindle in mouse oocytes.

Social-aware top-k spatial keyword search,Dingming Wu; Yafei Li; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,The boom of the spatial web has enabled spatial keyword queries that take a user locationand multiple search keywords as arguments and return the objects that are spatially andtextually relevant to these arguments. Recently; utilizing social data to improve searchresults; normally by giving a higher rank to the content generated or consumed by thesearcher's friends in the social network; has been studied in the information retrieval (IR)community. However; little attention has been drawn to the integration of social factors intospatial keyword query processing. In this paper; we propose a novel spatial keyword query;Social-aware top-k Spatial Keyword (SkSK) query; which enriches the semantics of theconventional spatial keyword query by introducing a new social relevance attribute. A hybridindex structure; called Social Network-aware IR-tree (SNIR-tree); is proposed for the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,11
Geo-social group queries with minimum acquaintance constraints,Qijun Zhu; Haibo Hu; Cheng Xu; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract The prosperity of location-based social networking has paved the way for newapplications of group-based activity planning and marketing. While such applicationsheavily rely on geo-social group queries (GSGQs); existing studies fail to produce acohesive group in terms of user acquaintance. In this paper; we propose a new family ofGSGQs with minimum acquaintance constraints. They are more appealing to users as theyguarantee a worst-case acquaintance level in the result group. For efficient processing ofGSGQs on large location-based social networks; we devise two social-aware spatial indexstructures; namely SaR-tree and SaR*-tree. The latter improves on the former by consideringboth spatial and social distances when clustering objects. Based on SaR-tree and SaR*-tree; novel algorithms are developed to process various GSGQs.

Asymmetric optimal-velocity car-following model,Xihua Xu; John Pang; Christopher Monterola,Abstract Taking the asymmetric characteristic of the velocity differences of vehicles intoaccount; we present an asymmetric optimal velocity model for a car-following theory. Theasymmetry between the acceleration and the deceleration is represented by the exponentialfunction with an asymmetrical factor; which agrees with the published experiment. Thismodel avoids the disadvantage of the unrealistically high acceleration appearing in previousmodels when the velocity difference becomes large. This model is simple and only has twoindependent parameters. The linear stability condition is derived and the phase transition ofthe traffic flow appears beyond the critical density. The strength of interaction betweenclusters is shown to increase with the asymmetry factor in our model.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,2015,10
Selectivity estimation of twig queries on cyclic graphs,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Recent applications including the Semantic Web; Web ontology and XML have sparked arenewed interest on graph-structured databases. Among others; twig queries have been apopular tool for retrieving subgraphs from graph-structured databases. To optimize twigqueries; selectivity estimation has been a crucial and classical step. However; the majority ofexisting works on selectivity estimation focuses on relational and tree data. In this paper; weinvestigate selectivity estimation of twig queries on possibly cyclic graph data. To facilitateselectivity estimation on cyclic graphs; we propose a matrix representation of graphs derivedfrom prime labeling-a scheme for reachability queries on directed acyclic graphs. With thisrepresentation; we exploit the consecutive ones property (C1P) of matrices.

Analysis of a loss-resilient proactive data transmission protocol in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; W-C Lee; Jianliang Xu,Many of sensor network applications require reliable data communication such that datapackets can be delivered to the destination without loss. However; existing reliabletransmission techniques either are too costly for resource-constrained sensor networks orhave limited capabilities for achieving desirable reliability. In this paper; an effective codingscheme that exploits the tradeoff between redundant data transmission andencoding/decoding complexity is proposed; with an in-depth study on two key designparameters; the degree of repair packets and the number of repair packets. Furthermore; theexpected probability of a destination obtaining all data packets under recoverable andpermanent failure model for proactive transmission is analyzed; respectively.

Due to limited bandwidth and scarce clientresources; client-side data caching plays an important role of enhancing the data availabilityand improving the response time. In this demonstration; we present CS Cache Enginesuitable for LBS. The underlying caching model is Complementary Space Caching (CScaching) scheme that we have recently presented in [citation]. Different from conventionaldata caching schemes; CS caching preserves a global view of the database by maintainingphysical objects and capturing those objects in the server but not in the cache asComplementary Regions (CRs) in the cache.

Theoretical studies on nonvolatile two-step; two-color holographic recording sensitivity for LiNbO3: Fe,Yan Shen; Guoquan Zhang; Bo Fu; Qingjun Xu; Jingjun Xu,Abstract The effects of material and experimental parameters on the nonvolatile two-step;two-color holographic recording sensitivity for LiNbO 3: Fe have been studied theoreticallybased on a two-center model. We have taken into account the direct electron transferbetween the deep-trap center Fe 2+/Fe 3+ and the shallow-trap center Nb Li 4+/Nb Li 5+due to the tunneling effect. The results show that the direct electron transfer between the Fe2+/Fe 3+ and the Nb Li 4+/Nb Li 5+ centers plays a key role in the improvement of two-step;two-color holographic recording sensitivity. The near-stoichiometric LiNbO 3: Fe has beenconfirmed theoretically to be of higher recording sensitivity and larger dynamic range thanthe congruent one in the low intensity region.

Towards social-aware ridesharing group query services,Yafei Li; Rui Chen; Lei Chen; Jianliang Xu,With the deep penetration of smartphones and geo-locating devices; ridesharing isenvisioned as a promising solution to transportation-related problems in metropolitan cities;such as traffic congestion and air pollution. Despite the potential to provide significantsocietal and environmental benefits; ridesharing has not so far been as popular asexpected. Notable barriers include social discomfort and safety concerns when travelingwith strangers. To overcome these barriers; in this paper; we propose a new type of Social-aware Ridesharing Group (SaRG) queries which retrieve a group of riders by taking intoaccount their social connections and spatial proximities. While SaRG queries are of practicalusefulness; we prove that; however; the SaRG query problem is NP-hard. Thus; we designan efficient algorithm with a set of powerful pruning techniques to tackle this problem. We …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2017,8
A light‐emitting diode (LED)‐based multispectral imaging system in evaluating retinal vein occlusion,Yupeng Xu; Xiaoxiao Liu; Lu Cheng; Li Su; Xun Xu,Materials and Methods Fifty-six eyes of 28 patients with RVO disease were evaluated byMSI; FP; FFA; and spectral domain OCT. All images were analyzed by an experiencedreading center grader. Nonperfusion area; occlusion area; and intraretinal edema fromocclusions and FP abnormalities (presence of cotton-wool spots; epiretinal membrane; hardexudates; and retinal hemorrhage) were documented. The diagnostic power of MSI wasevaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results Ofthe 56 eyes; 15 had branch RVO (BRVO); 13 had central RVO (CRVO); and 28 were normal.The ROC curve analysis showed that MSI was a better discriminator of RVO than FP (AUC=0.911 vs. 0.768; P= 0.0318).

Authenticated online data integration services,Qian Chen; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Data integration involves combining data from multiple sources and providing userswith a unified query interface. Data integrity has been a key problem in online dataintegration. Although a variety of techniques have been proposed to address the dataconsistency and reliability issues; there is little work on assuring the integrity of integrateddata and the correctness of query results. In this paper; we take the first step to proposeauthenticated data integration services to ensure data and query integrity even in thepresence of an untrusted integration server.

The potential of CXCL5 as a target for liver cancer–what do we know so far?,Jinglin Xia; Xiaojing Xu; Peixin Huang; Mingyan He; Xiangdong Wang,CXCL5; epithelial cell derived neutrophil attractant 78; is a CXC chemokine predominantlyexpressed on epithelial cells. It has specificity for CXCR2 receptors and is involved in therecruitment and activation of neutrophils. CXCL5 is considered a therapeutic target in livercancer; since treatment with small-interfering RNAs or antibodies against CXCL5 cansuppress tumor growth; proliferation; migration and invasion. Experimental evidencedemonstrated that CXCL5 antibodies could reduce the tumor growth and synergisticallyincrease the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Gefitinib; without the addition oftoxicity. A number of challenges are encountered and should be considered during thedevelopment and clinical application of CXCL5 target-specific drugs.

The genetics of brown coat color and white spotting in domestic yaks (Bos grunniens),M‐Q Zhang; X Xu; S‐J Luo,Summary Domestic yaks (Bos grunniens) exhibit two major coat color variations: a brown vs.wild-type black pigmentation and a white spotting vs. wild-type solid color pattern. Thegenetic basis for these variations in color and distribution remains largely unknown and maybe complicated by a breeding history involving hybridization between yaks and cattle. Here;we investigated 92 domestic yaks from China using a candidate gene approach. Sequencevariations in MC1R; PMEL and TYRP1 were surveyed in brown yaks; TYRP1 wasunassociated with the coloration and excluded. Recessive mutations from MC1R; or p.Gln34*; p. Met73Leu and possibly p. Arg142Pro; are reported in bovids for the first time andaccounted for approximately 40% of the brown yaks in this study. The remaining 60% ofbrown individuals correlated with a cattle-derived deletion mutation from PMEL (p …,Animal genetics,2014,8
Private proximity detection and monitoring with vicinity regions,Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Hong Ping Li; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Abstract Proximity detection is an important location-based service (LBS) that helps mobileusers find nearby friends. However; this service usually requires users to submit theirlocations to the server; which raises privacy concerns. In this paper; we propose symmetricproximity detection on vicinity regions as a fair and privacy-preserving solution to thisproblem. Specifically; each user can specify a nearby area as vicinity region; and two usersare considered to be in proximity only if they are located in each other's vicinity region. Toenable efficient detection; we design a shift-and-compare protocol for one-shot proximityqueries without revealing users' locations or vicinity regions. Furthermore; for continuousproximity monitoring; we propose an alert-area-based location update strategy with minimalupdate frequency; thereby saving communication cost.

Applications of Copula in hydrological extreme analysis,YP Xu; Jia Li; FF Cao; QH Ran,The dependences between multiple variables were analyzed aiming at some abnormalcrossing phenomena of rainfall depths for different durations in hydrological extremeanalysis. The relationship between multivariate joint density distributions and their marginaldistributions was described through Copula. Gumbel-Hougaard Copula was used to modelthe dependences of rainfall depths for different durations. Results showed that rainfalldepths obtained by Gumbel-Hougaard Copula were smaller than those obtained byconventional frequency analysis. Gumbel-Hougaard Copula can well describe themultivariate relationship and improve the abnormal crossing phenomena; so it can givemore reasonable results and be further applied to hydrological extreme analysis.,Zhejiang Daxue Xuebao (Gongxue Ban)/Journal of Zhejiang University (Engineering Science),2008,8
Adaptive power-aware prefetching schemes for mobile broadcast environments,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Caching and prefetching are common techniques in mobile broadcastenvironments. Several prefetching policies have been proposed in the literature to eitherachieve the minimum access latency or save power as much as possible. However; littlework has been carried out to adaptively balance these two metrics in a dynamic environmentwhere the user request arrival patterns change over time. This paper investigates how bothlow latency and low power consumption can be achieved for dynamic request patterns. Twoadaptive power-aware schemes; PT with secure region (PTSR) and adaptive prefetchingwith sliding caches (APSC); are proposed. Experimental results show the proposed policies;in particular APSC; achieve a much lower power consumption while maintaining a similaraccess latency as the existing policies.,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2003,8
Web browsing on small displays,Dik Lun Lee; Ka Kit Hoi; Wing Sing; Dicky Wong,Abstract Mobile computing has attracted attention in the past few years owing to technologyadvances. However; viewing documents on a mobile device isn't easy because of the limiteddisplay size; CPU power; and bandwidth. This is an obstacle for wireless Web browsingbecause there is no automatic transformation of HTML 1 documents designed for display onlarge screens to small PDA screens. The same problem occurs in devices for Web access(or Web-like access) on television. Although televisions are generally larger than mostcomputer monitors; the relatively low resolution and long viewing distance reduces theamount of information they can display. In this article; small displays are devices that displaya small amount of information for comfortable user viewing; because either the screens arephysically small or they have very low resolution.

FD-Buffer: A cost-based adaptive buffer replacement algorithm for flashmemory devices,Sai Tung On; Shen Gao; Bingsheng He; Ming Wu; Qiong Luo; Jianliang Xu,In this paper; we present a design and implementation of FD-Buffer; a cost-based adaptivebuffer manager for flash memory devices. Due to flash memory's unique hardware features;it has an inherent read-write asymmetry: writes involve expensive erase operations; whichusually makes them much slower than reads. To address this read-write asymmetry; werevisit buffer management and consider the average I/O cost per page access as the maincost metric; as opposed to the traditional miss rate. While there have been a number ofbuffer management algorithms that take the read-write asymmetry into consideration; mostalgorithms fail to effectively adapt to the runtime workload or different degrees of asymmetry.In this paper; we develop a new replacement algorithm in which we separate clean and dirtypages into two pools. The size ratio of the two pools is automatically adapted based on …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2014,7

Influence of absorption on optical trapping force of spherical particles in a focused Gaussian beam,Yanfeng Zhang; Yudong Li; Jiwei Qi; Guoxin Cui; Hongbing Liu; Jing Chen; Lihua Zhao; Jingjun Xu; Qian Sun,Abstract Based on the extended geometrical optics model; a theoretical study of the opticaltrapping force on a spherical particle with the absorption considered is presented. In thisstudy; the numerical simulation on transverse trapping force is given. The results suggestthat the absorption coefficient and the axial shift of the particle center from the focusedGaussian beam waist greatly influence the trapping properties. Spherical particles with weakabsorption could be stably trapped on the optical axis of the Gaussian beam; and thestiffness of trapping decreases with the increasing absorption coefficient of the particle. Ahighly absorbing particle has more complex trapping characteristics. As the particle locationchanges from the upstream to the downstream direction of the beam; the stable trappingposition may firstly locate on the beam axis; secondly be along a circular route centered …,Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics,2008,7

Optimal replica placement on transparent replication proxies for read/write data,Jianliang Xu; Bo Li; Dik L Lee,Data server replication is a promising technique for improving system performance in a largedistributed network. Recently; transparent data replication has been gaining increasingattention due to its low management overheads incurred. However; research on replicaplacement strategies for transparent data replication thus far focused on read operationsonly. In this paper; we consider examination for read/write applications of two data replicaplacement problems (ie; without and with constraint on the number of replicas respectively)for a single object on the deployed transparent replication proxies. The performanceobjective is to minimize the total data transfer cost for a target server under a given trafficpattern. Optimal solutions for these two problems are proposed; with complexities of O (N)and O (N+ N/sub o/P/sub o/M/sup 2/) respectively.

Reverse keyword search for spatio-textual top-$ k $ queries in location-based services,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Spatio-textual queries retrieve the most similar objects with respect to a given location and akeyword set. Existing studies mainly focus on how to efficiently find the top-k result set givena spatio-textual query. Nevertheless; in many application scenarios; users cannot preciselyformulate their keywords and instead prefer to choose them from some candidate keywordsets. Moreover; in information browsing applications; it is useful to highlight the objects withthe tags (keywords) under which the objects have high rankings. Driven by theseapplications; we propose a novel query paradigm; namely reverse keyword search for spatio-textual top-k queries (RSTQ). It returns the keywords under which a target object will be aspatio-textual top-k result. To efficiently process the new query; we devise a novel hybridindex KcR-tree to store and summarize the spatial and textual information of objects.

Optimizing incremental maintenance of minimal bisimulation of cyclic graphs,Jintian Deng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Graph-structured databases have numerous recent applications including theSemantic Web; biological databases and XML; among many others. In this paper; we studythe maintenance problem of a popular structural index; namely bisimulation; of a possiblycyclic data graph. In comparison; previous work mainly focuses on acyclic graphs. In thecontext of database applications; it is natural to compute minimal bisimulation with mergingalgorithms. First; we propose a maintenance algorithm for a minimal bisimulation of a cyclicgraph; in the style of merging. Second; to prune the computation on non-bisimilar SCC s; wepropose a feature-based optimization. The features are designed to be constructed andused more efficiently than bisimulation minimization. Third; we conduct an experimentalstudy that verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. Our features-based …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,6
High-pressure meta-stable phase of BeO: A first principle study,Peng-Fei Yuan; Jian Xu; Fu-Qian Jing,Abstract High-pressure phase transitions and phonon-dispersion relations of BeO havebeen studied by an ab initio method. A phase transition is found from a wurtzite structure(B4) to a cubic sodium chloride structure (B1) at about 122 GPa; but without a similar phasetransition from B4 to a cubic zinc blende structure (B3). At ambient conditions; the B1 phaseis not stable because in the calculated phonon-dispersion relations several modes withnegative frequencies in this phase have been detected. However; they change to positivequickly with increasing pressures. The B3 and B4 phases are both stable at variouspressures although the B3 phase is energetic meta-stable. When considering thetemperature effect; a B4→ B3 phase transition can happen; but the transition pressure ishigher than that of the B4→ B1 phase transition at the same temperature. Therefore; the …,Materials Chemistry and Physics,2010,6

Continuous density queries for moving objects,Xing Hao; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Monitoring dense areas; where the density of moving objects is higher than thegiven threshold; has many applications like traffic control; bandwidth management; andcollision probability evaluation. Although many studies have been done on density queriesfor moving objects in highly dynamic scenarios; they all focused on how to answer snapshotdensity queries. In this paper; we focus on continuously monitoring dense regions formoving objects. Based on the notion of safe interval; we propose effective algorithms toevaluate and keep track of dense regions. Experimental results show that our method canachieve high efficiency when monitoring dense regions for moving objects.,Proceedings of the Seventh ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2008,6
Mobile filter: Exploring migration of filters for error-bounded data collection in sensor networks,Dan Wang; Jianliang Xu; Jiangchuan Liu; Feng Wang,In wireless sensor networks; filters; which suppress data update reports within predefinederror bounds; effectively reduce the traffic volume for continuous data collection. All priorfilter designs; however; are stationary in the sense that each filter is attached to a specificsensor node and remains stationary over its lifetime. In this paper; we propose mobile filter;a novel design that explores migration of filters to maximize overall traffic reduction. A mobilefilter moves upstream along the data collection path; with its residual size being updatedaccording to the collected data. Intuitively; this migration extracts and relays unused filters;leading to more proactive suppressing of update reports. While extra communications areneeded to move filters; we show through probabilistic analysis that the overhead is outrun bythe gain from suppressing more data updates.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Energy efficient data management,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang,Sensor networks have reached the stage of massive deployment for a wide range ofapplications such as ecosystem monitoring and traffic surveillance (Akyildiz et al. 2002;Szewczyk et al. 2004). A wireless sensor network typically consists of a base station(sometimes called sink; or gateway); and a set of sensor nodes (sometimes called sources;see Fig. 12.1). The sensor nodes are used to continuously capture environmental data suchas temperature; humidity; lightness; etc. To send these data back to the base station andassist message routing; they are also equipped with radio transceivers that are capable ofshort-range transmission. The base station; as observed from the figure; serves as thegateway of the sensor network to exchange data and control messages with externalapplications to accomplish certain missions.

Temperature Coefficient of Sound Velocity of Perovskite-Enstatite and Lateral Thermal Heterogeneity in Earth's Lower Mantle,Zi-Zheng Gong; Hong-Sen Xie; Fu-Qian Jing; Yong-Gang Liu; Jie Guo; Jian Xu,Abstract Using the differences of sound velocity and temperature on the Hugoniot andisoentropic state; the temperature coefficients of sound velocity of perovskite-enstatite underhigh pressure were obtained. For compressional; shear and bulk wave velocities; theirtemperature coefficients decrease from 0.386; 0.251; 0.255 m/(s centerdot K) at 40 GPa to0.197; 0.131; 0.162 m/(s centerdot K) at 140 GPa; respectively. Extrapolating these to zeropressure results in (∂ K/∂ T) 0=-0.0279 GPa centerdot K-1; which is consistent very wellwith the value got by hydrostatic pressure experiment. On the basis of our data; we concludethat the compressional wave velocity anomaly of 0.1-0.2% in the deep lower mantle and 2%in the D" region would imply lateral thermal heterogeneity with amplitude of 53-106 K and1066 K in these regions; respectively.,Chinese Physics Letters,2000,6

Functional and molecular changes of MSCs in aging,Wei Kuang; Xin Xu; Yang Cao; Yue Xu; Lin Chen; Liang Jin; Jiali Tan,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are ideal candidates for different cellular therapies due totheir simple isolation; extensive expansion potential; and low immunogenicity. For varioustherapeutic approaches; such as bone and cartilage repair; MSCs are expected to replacethe damaged tissues by direct differentiation. However; age-related changes in MSCs leadto the loss of differentiation potential; loss of proliferation potential and increase in senescentcell numbers; which involve a steady loss of bone mass and frequently result inosteoporosis. In this review; we will introduce the characteristic and age-related changes ofMSCs. In addition; we will also summarize the potential rescue mechanisms of age-relatedbone loss involved in differentiation regulation and proliferation regulation; includingtranscription factors; signal pathways; epigenetic regulation; and oxidative stress …,Current stem cell research & therapy,2015,5
Structure-preserving subgraph query services,Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,A fundamental problem of graph databases is subgraph isomorphism query (aka subgraphquery): given a query graph Q and a graph database; it retrieves the graphs Gs from thedatabase that contain Q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with thecomputational hardness of subgraph isomorphism testing; outsourcing the computations to athird-party provider is an appealing alternative. However; confidentiality has been a criticalattribute of quality of service (QoS) in query services. To the best of our knowledge;subgraph query services with tunable preservation of privacy of structural information havenever been addressed. In this paper; we present the first work on structure-preservingsubIso (SPsubIso). A crucial step of our work is to transform subIso-the seminal subgraphisomorphism algorithm (the Ullmann's algorithm)-into a series of matrix operations.

DR obstructs blood supplyto the retina and has serious and long-lasting detrimental effects on quality of life. Panretinalphotocoagulation; a laser surgical intervention; is advocated for early treatment of DR toprevent visual loss; however; results from studies reporting its efficacy vary markedly. In thisreview; we systematically conducted a database search of randomized controlled trials thatinvestigated the safety and efficacy of different types of laser interventions; alone or incombination with adjunct intravitreal steroid utilization; in patients with DR. Data from 14studies demonstrated that panretinal photocoagulation can be a safe and effective option forreducing visual loss and blindness in patients with DR.,Expert review of medical devices,2015,5

Some social networks released check-in services that allow usersto share their visiting locations with their friends. In this paper; users' interests are modeledby check-in actions. We propose a new spatial-aware interest group (SIG) query thatretrieves a user group of size k where every user is highly interested in the query keywordand also spatially close to each other. An efficient algorithm AIR based on the IR-tree isproposed for the processing of SIG queries. Furthermore; an optimization is developed andachieves a much better performance than the baseline algorithm.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,5

Synthesis of uniform BN-coated aluminum borate nanowhiskers and their applications in reinforced magnesium matrix composites,Zhaojun Mo; Chunyong Liang; Jing Lin; Hongshui Wang; Xuewen Xu; Long Hu; Ying Fan; Xinghua Zhang; Yanming Xue; Chengchun Tang,Abstract We report on a controlled synthesis of BN tubular layers-coated aluminum borate(Al 18 B 4 O 33) nanowhiskers via a sol–gel and post-thermal-treatment method. A newboron source; trimethyl borate is used as a novel reactant. The Al 18 B 4 O 33 nanowhiskerswith diameters of∼ 20–50 nm and length of∼ 0.5–2 μm are homogeneously sheathed overtheir entire lengths with thin BN tubular layers. The dependence of product morphology andstructure has been investigated systematically. The pioneering studies on BN-coated Al 18 B4 O 33 nanowhiskers reinforced Mg matrix composites reveal that the protective BN coatingscan effectively prevent the interfacial reaction between Al 18 B 4 O 33 nanowhiskers and Mgalloys. A remarkable increase in composite hardness has been obtained by the addition ofcoated nanowhiskers into Mg alloys with a suitable content.

Impact of moving rainfall on soil erosion based on crust characteristics [J],Qihua RAN; Zhinan SHI; Jianjun ZHAO; Yueping XU,The impact of the crust characteristics on soil erosion for moving rainfall conditions wasinvestigated using comparative rainfall-runoff tests on small slopes (4 m× 1 m). Thespatiotemporal characteristics of the runoff; soil erosion; and grain size distribution show thatcrust development results in less soil erosion. The peak erosion occurred earlier than thedischarge peak for upstream-moving rainfall events when the crust was fully developed;while the two peaks happened simultaneously for downstream-moving rainfall events. Themaximum erosion and sediment concentration peaks occurred with rainfall intensities ofaround 3.6× 10-5 m/s for upstream-moving events. The grading of the eroded sediment ismost strongly affected by the crust at the beginning of the rainfall events with silt as 70% ofthe total eroded materials.

K-selection query over uncertain data,Xingjie Liu; Mao Ye; Jianliang Xu; Yuan Tian; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract This paper studies a new query on uncertain data; called k-selection query. Givenan uncertain dataset of N objects; where each object is associated with a preference scoreand a presence probability; ak-selection query returns k objects such that the expectedscore of the “best available” objects is maximized. This query is useful in many applicationdomains such as entity web search and decision making. In evaluating k-selection queries;we need to compute the expected best score (EBS) for candidate k-selection sets andsearch for the optimal selection set with the highest EBS. Those operations are costly due tothe extremely large search space. In this paper; we identify several important properties of k-selection queries; including EBS decomposition; query recursion; and EBS bounding.

TNF-α promoter polymorphisms predict the response to etanercept more powerfully than that to infliximab/adalimumab in spondyloarthritis,Jing Liu; Zheng Dong; Qi Zhu; Dongyi He; Yanyun Ma; Aiping Du; Fan He; Dongbao Zhao; Xia Xu; Hui Zhang; Jiucun Wang,Abstract While previous studies have researched in association analyses between TNFαpromoter polymorphisms and responses to TNF blockers in spondyloarthritis patients; theirresults were conflicting. Therefore; we aimed to determine whether TNFα promoterpolymorphisms could predict response to TNF blockers and find the source of heterogeneity.Data were extracted and analyzed from published articles and combined with ourunpublished data. We found that the greatest potential sources of heterogeneity in theresults were gender ratio; disease type; continents; and TNF blockers. Then Stratificationanalysis showed that the TNFα− 308 G allele and the− 238 G allele predicted a goodresponse to TNF blockers (OR= 2.64 [1.48–4.73]; 2.52 [1.46–4.37]). However; G alleles ofTNFα− 308 and− 238 could predict the response to etanercept (OR= 4.02 [2.24–7.23]; …,Scientific reports,2016,4
Whole genome sequencing identifies a missense mutation in HES7 associated with short tails in Asian domestic cats,Xiao Xu; Xin Sun; Xue-Song Hu; Yan Zhuang; Yue-Chen Liu; Hao Meng; Lin Miao; He Yu; Shu-Jin Luo,Abstract Domestic cats exhibit abundant variations in tail morphology and serve as anexcellent model to study the development and evolution of vertebrate tails. Cats withshortened and kinked tails were first recorded in the Malayan archipelago by CharlesDarwin in 1868 and remain quite common today in Southeast and East Asia. To elucidatethe genetic basis of short tails in Asian cats; we built a pedigree of 13 cats segregating at thetrait with a founder from southern China and performed linkage mapping based on wholegenome sequencing data from the pedigree. The short-tailed trait was mapped to a 5.6 Mbregion of Chr E1; within which the substitution c. 5T> C in the somite segmentation-relatedgene HES7 was identified as the causal mutation resulting in a missense change (p.

Rank-aware dynamic migrations and adaptive demotions for DRAM power management,Yanchao Lu; Donghong Wu; Bingsheng He; Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu; Minyi Guo,Modern DRAM architectures allow a number of low-power states on individual memoryranks for advanced power management. Many previous studies have taken advantage ofdemotions on low-power states for energy saving. However; most of the demotion schemesare statically performed on a limited number of pre-selected low-power states; and aresuboptimal for different workloads and memory architectures. Even worse; the idle periodsare often too short for effective power state transitions; especially for memory intensiveapplications. Wrong decisions on power state transition incur significant energy and delaypenalties. In this paper; we propose a novel memory system design named RAMZzz withrank-aware energy saving optimizations including dynamic page migrations and adaptivedemotions. Specifically; we group the pages with similar access locality into the same …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2016,4
Common variants in LRP2 and COMT genes affect the susceptibility of gout in a Chinese population,Zheng Dong; Dongbao Zhao; Chengde Yang; Jingru Zhou; Qiaoxia Qian; Yanyun Ma; Hongjun He; Hengdong Ji; Yajun Yang; Xiaofeng Wang; Xia Xu; Yafei Pang; Hejian Zou; Li Jin; Jiucun Wang,Gout is a common inflammation disease resulting from an increase in serum uric acid.Nearly 70% of uric acid is excreted via the kidneys. To date; evidence for an associationbetween genetic loci and gout is absent; equivocal or not replicated. Our study aims to testvariants in two genes abundantly expressed in the kidney; LRP2 and COMT; for theirassociation with uric acid and gout. In total; 1318 Chinese individuals were genotyped forrs2544390 in LRP2 and rs4680 in COMT. These LRP2 and COMT gene polymorphismsshowed no significant effect on uric acid (P= 0.204 and 0.188; separately); however;rs2544390 in LRP2 did influence uric acid levels in individuals with BMI≥ 25 (P= 0.009).

Authentication of Top-$ $ k $ $ Spatial Keyword Queries in Outsourced Databases,Sen Su; Han Yan; Xiang Cheng; Peng Tang; Peng Xu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In this paper; we study the authentication of top-k spatial keyword queries inoutsourced databases. We first present a scheme based on tree-forest indexes; whichconsist of an MR-tree (which is the state-of-the-art authenticated data structure for theauthentication of spatial queries) and a collection of Merkle term trees (MT-trees). The tree-forest indexes can support efficient top-k spatial keyword query (k SKQ) processing andauthentication. To derive a small verification object (VO) to be returned to the user; we putforward an entry pruning based scheme; where an MT*-tree is presented. The entries ineach node of MT*-tree are ordered and an embedded Merkle hash tree (embedded-MHT) isconstructed over them. By employing a novel pruning strategy; the redundant entries in eachnode of MT*-trees can be eliminated from VO.

A promising future for peptides in ophthalmology: work effectively and smartly,Q Sun; X Xu,Despite progress in pharmacological modalities; treatments for ocular diseases areinconvenient; traumatic; costly and often end in poor final visual results. Peptides;considered as protein fragments; can adequately mimic protein binding and thus are usedas therapeutic agents. Chemical modifications and bioengineering techniques are beingfrequently introduced to improve efficacy and stability of peptides; thereby improving theirdruggability. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs); peptides characterized by penetratingplasma membrane; are famous barrier-passers. They are good candidates for carryingdrugs through ocular barriers. Therapeutic peptide and CPP perfectly complement eachother. Once united; they may form an optimal formula for ocular topical administration; whichcan work both effectively and smartly.

A private DNA motif finding algorithm,Rui Chen; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Abstract With the increasing availability of genomic sequence data; numerous methods havebeen proposed for finding DNA motifs. The discovery of DNA motifs serves a critical step inmany biological applications. However; the privacy implication of DNA analysis is normallyneglected in the existing methods. In this work; we propose a private DNA motif findingalgorithm in which a DNA owner's privacy is protected by a rigorous privacy model; knownas∊-differential privacy. It provides provable privacy guarantees that are independent ofadversaries' background knowledge. Our algorithm makes use of the n-gram model and isoptimized for processing large-scale DNA sequences. We evaluate the performance of ouralgorithm over real-life genomic data and demonstrate the promise of integrating privacy intoDNA motif finding.,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,4

An efficient approach for continuous density queries,Jie Wen; Xiaofeng Meng; Xing Hao; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In location-based services; a density query returns the regions with highconcentrations of moving objects (MOs). The use of density queries can help users identifycrowded regions so as to avoid congestion. Most of the existing methods try very hard toimprove the accuracy of query results; but ignore query efficiency. However; response timeis also an important concern in query processing and may have an impact on userexperience. In order to address this issue; we present a new definition of continuous densityqueries. Our approach for processing continuous density queries is based on the new notionof a safe interval; using which the states of both dense and sparse regions are dynamicallymaintained. Two indexing structures are also used to index candidate regions foraccelerating query processing and improving the quality of results. The efficiency and …,Frontiers of Computer Science,2012,4
Towards an efficient flash-based mid-tier cache,Yi Ou; Jianliang Xu; Theo Härder,Abstract Due to high access performance and price-per-byte considerations; flash memoryhas been recommended for use as a mid-tier cache in a multi-tier storage system. However;previous studies related to flash-based mid-tier caching only considered the indirect use offlash memory via a flash translation layer; which causes expensive flash-based cachemaintenance. This paper identifies the weaknesses of such indirect methods; with a focus onthe cold-page migration problem. As improvements; we propose two novel approaches; anindirect approach called LPD (logical page drop) and a native approach called NFA (nativeflash access). The basic idea is to drop cold pages proactively so that the garbage collectionoverhead can be minimized. Our experiments demonstrate that both approaches; especiallythe native one; effectively improve the use of flash memory in the mid-tier cache.

Joint Probability Analysis of Drought Duration and Severity Based on Copula Approach [J],Yue-ping XU; Qing-qing ZHANG; Zhang-hua LOU; De-di LIU,To solve the problem of the shortage of drought data; autoregressive Markov model wasused to extrapolate original time series and long time series of drought data are obtained.Then Copula method was employed to simulate the dependence between drought durationand severity; and bootstrap method was used to check the validity of Copula. In the end; ajoint distribution of drought duration and severity was obtained with P-Ⅲ and Gammadistributions as margins respectively. The simulation results show that Clayton Copula canmodel the dependence of the two variables pretty well. Using the Copula approach to modelvarious events of hydrological drought is a simple but reasonable method; which putsdifferent variables of extreme drought events into consideration and this approach can serveas a very useful tool for drought extreme analysis.,Journal of Tianjin University,2010,4

Effect of the blade leading edge on the performance of a centrifugal compressor,Chu Leizhe; Du Jianyi; Zhao Xiaolu; Xu Jianzhong,Three different geometry shapes of the blade leading edge in a centrifugal compressor wereinvestigated in this paper. Numerical simulation was done to analyze the effect of theleading edge shape on the performance of the centrifugal compressor. The result shows thatcompared to the blunt leading edge; the circular leading edge will raise the chocking massflow. The pressure ratio and efficiency will increase obviously. Using elliptical leading edgewill get a further improvement on the performance than circular leading edge. The analysisof the flow field shows that the leading edge often causes flow separation near the inlet;using circular leading edge and elliptical leading edge will reduce the separation. What" smore; using circular and elliptical leading edge will also reduce the wake loss near the outletof the impeller.

Experience of urgent reconstruction of electrical injuries,ZHI‐XIANG ZHU; XIAO‐GUANG XU; YUE‐AN ZHANG; LI‐YING CHEN; TIAN‐YI LIU; WEI‐PING LI,ABSTRACT: Although there have been great advances in the treatment of electrical injuriesin the last 20 years; the extremity loss ratio in electrical injuries remains at an unacceptablyhigh level. The primary reason for this is the progressive tissue necrosis and enlargement ofthe necrosis in the wound. The goal in this study is to examine possible ways to break thenecrotic malignancy circle and save the form and function of damaged extremities. As aresult of systematic experimental and clinical research; a comprehensive urgentreconstruction alternative for electrical injuries has been proposed. The alternative includesthe following principles: debriding the wound as early as possible after injury; preserving asmuch as possible the vital tissue structures; such as nerve; vessels; joints; tendons; andbone; even when they have undergone devitalization or local necrosis; transplanting …,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1999,4

AutoG: A visual query autocompletion framework for graph databases,Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Composing queries is evidently a tedious task. This is particularly true of graphqueries as they are typically complex and prone to errors; compounded by the fact thatgraph schemas can be missing or too loose to be helpful for query formulation. Despite thegreat success of query formulation aids; in particular; automatic query completion; graphquery autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this demonstration; wepresent a novel interactive visual subgraph query autocompletion framework called A uto Gwhich alleviates the potentially painstaking task of graph query formulation. Specifically;given a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs and a visual query fragment qformulated by a user; A uto G returns top-k query suggestions Q′ as output at interactivetime.

A cooperative caching algorithm for multi-cell data broadcasting,Ji Xu; Yanmin Zhu; Jianliang Xu; Bo Li; Lionel M Ni,Broadcasting is an effective technique to reduce network traffic; and is inherently supportedby wireless networks. It thus has been advocated by numerous on-demand data accessprotocols. In a wireless cellular network; broadcasting can be implemented within a singlecell. However; the data owned by different cells could be different. If a client requests a dataitem available only in a remote cell; an inter-cell data transmission over some wired link isneeded; which introduces additional access delay. In this paper; we demonstrate that suchdelay can be minimized through the use of remote caching. Specifically; we propose a novelcooperative caching scheme; in which each cell dynamically allocates the cache spaces fordata from different remote cells. It makes replacement decisions according to severalimportant factors: data item access frequency; cell traffic; and retrieval delay.

In these services; informationprovided to mobile users reflects their current geographical locations. To build an LDISsystem; however; there are a number of challenges: constrains of a mobile computingenvironment; heterogeneity in systems used by different content providers; and performanceissues due to the organization of data servers. To meet these challenges; this paperproposes a distributed client/agent/server model for Web-based LDISs based on the CORBAarchitecture.

P-wave velocities of alkaline olivine basalt at high pressure and temperature and its controlling factors,Maoshuang Song; Hongsen Xie; Yueming Zhang; Wei Hou; Jian Xu; Yousheng Xu,SEISMIC wave inversion is one of the most important means for us to recognize thecomposition and structure of the Earth's interior. Although the experimental techniques ofelastic wave velocity measurement at in situ high pressure and temperature develop veryfast in recent years and the elastic wave velocities of the Earth's interior material can bemeasured at pressure up to several hundred kilobars in laboratory; geophysicists are still inshort of elastic wave velocity data of the Earth's interior material at high pressure andtemperature which is the most important experimental basis for geophysical interpretation. Inthis note we measure the P-wave velocities of serpentinized alkaline olivine basalt at 2.0-5.0GPa and 25-1 200 C; and then discuss the effects of temperature; pressure and phasetransformation as well as serpentine dehydration on its P-wave velocity.

The formation of monosodiumurate crystals (MSU) is due to the elevated uric acid levels in the blood (Yang et al.; 2016).But only 10% of individuals with hyperuricemia develop gout; suggesting that certain peopleare at a higher risk of developing MSU crystals (Merriman and Dalbeth; 2011) or initiating ofthe acute inflammatory response than others. This phenomenon is likely explained by thecomplex pathogenic process of inflammation and innate immunity in the development ofgout since the MSU crystal-mediated inflammatory pathways have been reported toassociate with many immunological processes (Behrens et al.; 2008).

General purpose index-based method for efficient MaxRS query,Xiaoling Zhou; Wei Wang; Jianliang Xu,Abstract The Maximizing Range Sum problem is widely applied in facility locating; spatialdata mining; and clustering problems. The current most efficient method solves it in time O(n\log n) for a particular given rectangle size. This is inefficient in cases where the queriesare frequently called with different parameters. Thus; in this paper; we propose an index-based method that solves the maxRS query in time O (\log n) for any given query. Besides;our method can be used to solve the k-enclosing problem in time O (1) for any given k valueif indexes are sorted according to the optimizing criteria; or O ((nk)^ 2 k+ n\log n) withoutusing any index; which is comparative to the current most efficient work.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2016,2

Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor query without information leakage,Lu Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Bichromatic Reverse Nearest Neighbor (BRNN) Query is an important query type inlocation-based services (LBS) and has many real life applications; such as site selectionand resource allocation. However; such query requires the client to disclose sensitivelocation information to the LBS. The only existing method for privacy-preserving BRNNquery adopts the cloaking-region paradigm; which blurs the location into a spatial region.However; the LBS can still deduce some information (albeit not exact) about the location. Inthis paper; we aim at strong privacy wherein the LBS learns nothing about the querylocation. To this end; we employ private information retrieval (PIR) technique; whichaccesses data pages anonymously from a database. Based on PIR; we propose a securequery processing framework together with various indexing and optimization techniques …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,2

Calibration of significant wave height from HY-2A satellite altimeter,Jinsong Yang; Guangjun Xu; Yuan Xu; Xiaoyan Chen,The HY-2A; which was launched on 2011/8/16; is the first microwave marine remote sensingsatellite developed by China. In this paper; the significant wave height (SWH) datameasured by HY-2A satellite altimeter were compared with the data observed by Jason-1/2satellite altimeter as well as the data measured by buoys. It was found that there was asystematic error of 0.3-0.4 m between SWH obtained from HY-2A and Jason-1/2 altimetersand buoys. The comparison indicated that there was a linear relationship between the dataof HY-2A and buoys; which could be used to calibrate SWH measured by HY-2A to betterreflect the real marine situation. Comparisons show that the results are good and HY-2Aaltimetry data work well with Jason-1/2 satellite altimetry data.,Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XI,2014,2

Predicting the optimal ad-hoc index for reachability queries on graph databases,Jintian Deng; Fei Liu; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Due to the recent advances in graph databases; a large number of ad-hoc indexesfor a fundamental query; in particular; reachability query; have been proposed. Theperformances of these indexes on different graphs have known to be very different. Worststill; deriving an accurate cost model for selecting the optimal index of a graph databaseappears to be a daunting task. In this paper; we propose a hierarchical predictionframework; based on neural networks and a set of graph features and a knowledge base onpast predictions; to determine the optimal index for a graph database. For ease ofpresentation; we propose our framework with three structurally distinguishable indexes. Ourexperiments show that our framework is accurate.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,2
Structural and ferroelectric behaviours in blends of vinylidene fluoride oligomer and poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) copolymer thin film,XiuLi Zhang; Wenbin Dong; Yunfeiyue Liu; Guoqiang Xu; HaiSheng Xu,Abstract The structure and ferroelectric properties of ultrathin blend films fabricated by thespin-coating process at room temperature from the mixed solution of vinylidene fluorideoligomers (OVDF)(n= 18) and poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) copolymers (PVDF-TrFE) are investigated in detail. When OVDF content in mixture is between 40% and 60%;the remanent polarization and fatigue behaviour of the P (VDF-TrFE)/OVDF blend films areall improved. The ferroelectric thin film capacitor with poly (styrenesulfonate)(PSSH)interlayer exhibits a prominent performance with a remanent polarization of 120 mC m− 2even as the thickness of the blend film is 80 nm. Meanwhile; we demonstrate that theincrease in the OVDF content from 0% to 100% cannot affect the molecular chain orientationof the P (VDF-TrFE)/OVDF blend films and the molecular chains are in parallel with the …,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2011,2
Inhalation of fine particulates alters hippocampal neuronal morphology,LK Fonken; X Xu; ZM Weil; G Chen; Q Sun; S Rajagopalan; RJ Nelson,Mice exposed for a long term to fine particulate matter have reduced spine density in theCA1 region of the hippocampus as compared with mice exposed to filtered air. Thesechanges in hippocampal morphology are associated with impairments in learning andmemory and increased depressive-like responses. Here; we show a (a) bright field image ofthe hippocampus (x 25) and (b) a representative pyramidal neuron from the CA1 region (x400). Mice exposed to particulate matter showed (c) reduced spine density on CA1 apicaldendrites (x 1000).

Mobile filter: exploring filter migration for error-bounded continuous sensor data collection,Dan Wang; Jianliang Xu; Feng Wang; Jiangchuan Liu,In wireless sensor networks; filters that suppress data update reports within predefined errorbounds effectively reduce the traffic volume for continuous data collection. All prior filterdesigns; however; are stationary in the sense that each filter is attached to a specific sensornode and remains stationary over its lifetime. In this paper; we propose a mobile filter; ie; anovel design that explores the migration of filters to maximize overall traffic reduction. Amobile filter moves upstream along the data-collection path; with its residual size beingupdated according to the collected data. Intuitively; this migration extracts and relays unusedfilters; leading to more proactive suppression of update reports. While extra communicationsare needed to move filters; we show through probabilistic analysis that the overhead isoutrun by the gain from suppressing more data updates.

Corrosion detection of steel in concrete by use of galvanostatic pulse technique,XU Jing; YAO Wu,Abstract Corrosion behavior of steel in concrete with different chloride ion concentration wasstudied by means of galvanostatic pulse; which is introduced as a new type of non-destructive technique nowadays. Potential transient technique galvanostatically induced isused to determine the corrosion rate with two data analysis methods; followed by comparingto that of the traditional linear polarization method. It is shown that the choice of perturbationmagnitude of signal to be applied depends strongly on the corrosion state of steel. Too smallcurrent makes it difficult to separate the potential signal from background noise; whereashigher current results in intensive polarization. Thus; neither of two is beneficial for the dataprocessing. Anodic current conversion method is fast and efficient in analyzing thegalvanostatic pulse curves; however; this approach has some limitations in case of large …,Journal of Chinese Society for Corrosion and protection,2010,2
Advancements in expansin genes of plants.,Xiao Xu; Qian Xu; Kai Zhang; JiChen Xu,Abstract: Expansin gene is a kind of conserved multigene family with four sub-families α; β; γand δ. As an important component in plant cell wall; expansin refers to a nonenzymaticprotein with unique" loosening" effects on plant cell walls to accelerate the cell extension;increase its flexibility; and release the pressure by environment factors. The advancementsof expansins support that expansins are involved in most of the physiological process inplants; such as seed germination; root hair promotion and extension; leaf formation; petioleoff; pollen tube growth; fruit ripening; and other developmental process where cell wallloosening occurs. It is also involved in the process of drought; heat or disease resistance inplants.

Adaptive data dissemination in wireless sensor networks,Jian Xu; Jianliang Xu; Shanping Li; Qing Gao; Gang Peng,Abstract Recent years have witnessed growing research interest in wireless sensornetworks. In the literature; three data storage strategies; ie; local; data-centric; and index-centric; have been proposed to answer one-shot queries originated from inside the network.Through careful analysis; we show in this paper that each of the three strategies respectivelyachieves the best performance in a certain range of query-rate to update-rate (Q2U) ratios.We therefore propose several adaptive schemes which periodically adjust the data storageand dissemination strategy in accordance with the Q2U ratio observed in the network.Experimental results demonstrate that in dynamic environments the proposed adaptiveschemes substantially outperform the three basic strategies.,International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications,2004,2
Programmable 2D laser marking device based on a pulsed UV image coherent amplifier,Thierry Lamarque; Ralf Nicolaus; Brigitte Loiseaux; Jean-Pierre Huignard; Gintas Slekys; Jingjun Xu,We present a novel technique for engraving microscopic 2D patterns in one step with a UVpulsed laser by means of a versatile programmable approach. The laser beam is divided toan expanded low energy signal beam which is spatially modulated by a LCD modulator anda higher energy pump beam with a plane homogeneous wave front. Both beams aresuperposed in a highly magnesium doped photorefractive lithium-niobate crystal where anenergy transfer towards the weaker signal beam takes place. The spatially modulated andamplified signal beam is then de-magnified and imaged onto the surface where the imagehas to be engraved. The need for the coherent amplifier rises out of the fact that LCDs areunable to withstand the high energy throughput required for etching. The combination of theamplifier with the amplitude modulator leads to a faster and more flexible solution than …,Fourth International Symposium on Laser Precision Microfabrication,2003,2

Authenticating Aggregate Queries over Set-Valued Data with Confidentiality,Cheng Xu; Qian Chen; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xiaojun Hei,With recent advances in data-as-a-service (DaaS) and cloud computing; aggregate queryservices over set-valued data are becoming widely available for business intelligence thatdrives decision making. However; as the service provider is often a third-party delegate ofthe data owner; the integrity of the query results cannot be guaranteed and is thusimperative to be authenticated. Unfortunately; existing query authentication techniqueseither do not work for set-valued data or they lack data confidentiality. In this paper; wepropose authenticated aggregate queries over set-valued data that not only ensure theintegrity of query results but also preserve the confidentiality of source data. As manyaggregate queries are composed of multiset operations such as set union and subset; wefirst develop a family of privacy-preserving authentication protocols for primitive multiset …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Assuring spatio-temporal integrity on mobile devices with minimum location disclosure,Haibo Hu; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Since the boom of smartphones and location-based services; spatio-temporal data (ie; userlocations with timestamps) have become increasingly essential in many real-lifeapplications. To ensure these data are faithfully extracted from the underlying locationtracking hardware and not altered by any malicious party or the user himself/herself; integrityassurance schemes such as digital signatures or message authentication codes (MAC) mustbe adopted. However; these conventional schemes disclose to the verifier the completeplaintext location and thus jeopardize users' privacy. In this paper; we propose an integrityassurance scheme with minimum location disclosure. That is; the granule of the disclosedlocation is just small enough to prove the user is/has been to a certain place; and the verifiercannot learn anything beyond it. To this end; we propose a new MAC scheme called …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2017,1
Continuous range-based skyline queries in road networks,Xiaoyi Fu; Xiaoye Miao; Jianliang Xu; Yunjun Gao,Abstract With the ever-growing popularity of smartphone devices in recent years; skylinequeries over spatial Web objects in road networks have received increasing attention. In theliterature; various techniques have been developed to tackle skyline queries that take bothspatial and non-spatial attributes into consideration. However; the existing solutions onlyfocus on solving point-based queries; where the query location is a spatial point. Weobserve that in many real-life applications; the user location is often represented by a spatialrange. Thus; in this paper; we study a new problem of range-based skyline queries (CRSQs)in road networks. Two efficient algorithms named landmark-based (LBA) and index-based(IBA) algorithms are proposed. We also present incremental versions of LBA and IBA tohandle continuous range-based skyline queries over moving objects. Extensive …,World Wide Web,2017,1
Top-k Taxi Recommendation in Realtime Social-Aware Ridesharing Services,Xiaoyi Fu; Jinbin Huang; Hua Lu; Jianliang Xu; Yafei Li,Abstract Ridesharing has been becoming increasingly popular in urban areas worldwide forits low cost and environment friendliness. In this paper; we introduce social-awareness intorealtime ridesharing services. In particular; upon receiving a user's trip request; the serviceranks feasible taxis in a way that integrates detour in time and passengers' cohesion insocial distance. We propose a new system framework to support such a social-aware taxi-sharing service. It provides two methods for selecting candidate taxis for a given trip request.The grid-based method quickly goes through available taxis and returns a relatively largercandidate set; whereas the edge-based method takes more time to obtain a smallercandidate set. Furthermore; we design techniques to speed up taxi route scheduling for agiven trip request.

Human-powered data cleaning for probabilistic reachability queries on uncertain graphs,Xin Lin; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Uncertain graph models are widely used in real-world applications such as knowledgegraphs and social networks. To capture the uncertainty; each edge in an uncertain graph isassociated with an existential probability that signifies the likelihood of the existence of theedge. One notable issue of querying uncertain graphs is that the results are sometimesuninformative because of the edge uncertainty. In this paper; we consider probabilisticreachability queries; which are one of the fundamental classes of graph queries. To makethe results more informative; we adopt a crowdsourcing-based approach to clean theuncertain edges. However; considering the time and monetary cost of crowdsourcing; it is aproblem to efficiently select a limited set of edges for cleaning that maximizes the qualityimprovement. We prove that the edge selection problem is# P-hard. In light of the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1

AutoG: a visual query autocompletion framework for graph databases,Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Composing queries is evidently a tedious task. This is particularly true of graphqueries as they are typically complex and prone to errors; compounded by the fact thatgraph schemas can be missing or too loose to be helpful for query formulation. Despite thegreat success of query formulation aids; in particular; automatic query completion; graphquery autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this paper; we proposea novel framework for subgraph query autocompletion (called AutoG). Given an initial queryq and a user's preference as input; AutoG returns ranked query suggestions Q'Q′ as output.Users may choose a query from Q'Q′ and iteratively apply AutoG to compose their queries.The novelties of AutoG are as follows: First; we formalize query composition.

Side-effect estimation: A filtering approach to the view update problem,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Views and their updates have long been a fundamental technology required in a wide rangeof applications. However; it has been known that updates through views is a classicalintractable problem. In this paper; we propose a novel; data-oriented approach to thisproblem that provides a practical support for view updates. In particular; we propose asummarization of the source database of views; which serves as an update filter. The updatefilter aims to efficiently reject untranslatable view updates by estimating the side effects of theupdates; thereby avoiding costly translation analysis. For applications where estimationerrors are not preferred; our update filter can be tuned to be exact. In this paper; we presentour approach with SPJ views; an important class of view definitions. We first revise thenotion of estimation errors to quantify the filter's qualities. We then propose a novel join …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,1

Pulsed UV image amplification for programmable laser marking,Thierry Lamarque; Ralf Nicolaus; Brigitte Loiseaux; Jean-Pierre Huignard; Jingjun Xu,We present a novel technique for engraving 2D patterns in one step with a UV pulsed laserby means of a versatile programmable approach. The spatial light modulation is actuallyperformed by a reflective liquid crystal display instead of a mask. As these devices areunable to withstand the high energy throughput required for etching; the modulated beam isamplified by two-wave mixing in a nonlinear optical medium such as lithium niobate crystaloptimized for the UV interaction. This technique provides a faster and more flexiblealternative to laser marking with pixel by pixel raster-scan or fixed mask projection mode andeg can be applied to identify valuable items by imprinting a code onto the surface.,19th Congress of the International Commission for Optics: Optics for the Quality of Life,2003,1

Localized meteorological features of Yamase and sea breezes and their movements to hilly mountain area (Kuji City and Yamagata Village in Iwate Prefecture),Hiromitsu KANNO; Jianqing XU; Kiyoshi OZAWA,Abstract The meteorological features of Yamase (cold northeasterly wind) and sea breezes areinvestigated for the summer of 1997; and their invasion to the hilly mountain area on the Pacificside aredis- cussed. When sea breezes are present; solar radiation is generally large; but thetemperature decreases on the coastal region of the Pacific due to the cold air masses broughtby the wind from the ocean. During the Yamase period; both solar radiation and temperaturedecrease; and the lowest solar radiation areas are found on the eastern side of themountains. The Yamase process has three stages : early; peak; and late. In the peak stage; therewas a mixed layer from the surface to about 900 hPa (1;000 m) and easterly winds reached above800 hPa (2;000 m). In the early and late stages there were stable layers at lower height with easterlywinds.

Monte Carlo simulation of charge transport in organic solar cells,Xin Xu,Abstract Organic solar cells have advantages over the traditional inorganic solar cells. Theflexibility and light-weight of an organic solar device lead to novel deployment unattainableby inorganic solar devices. There is a wide range of materials that can be used to fabricatean organic solar cell with many suitable conducting polymers and small molecules. Thelarge number of appropriate materials means that it is possible to tune an organic cell totarget specific wavelengths of light by targeting specific band gaps. Despite all thesebenefits; the commercialization of organic solar devices has been limited by their lowefficiency. One path to raising the efficiency is to better understand how the morphology orinternal structure of the solar cell influences charge transport.

In some cases; it can be difficult for users to specify appropriatequery parameters. After getting a query result; users may find some desired objects areunexpectedly missing and may therefore question the entire result. Enabling why-notquestions in this setting may aid users to retrieve better results; thus improving the overallutility of the query functionality. This paper studies the direction-aware why-not spatialkeyword top-k query problem.

Ontology-based Graph Visualization for Summarized View,Xin Huang; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; William K Cheung; Yanchun Zhang; Jiming Liu,Abstract Data summarization that presents a small subset of a dataset to users has beenwidely applied in numerous applications and systems. Many datasets are coded withhierarchical terminologies; eg; the international classification of Diseases-9; Medical SubjectHeading; and Gene Ontology; to name a few. In this paper; we study the problem ofselecting a diverse set of k elements to summarize an input dataset with hierarchicalterminologies; and visualize the summary in an ontology structure. We propose an efficientgreedy algorithm to solve the problem with (1-1/e)≈ 62%-approximation guarantee.Preliminary experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness andefficiency of the proposed algorithm for data summarization.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Stomach frame-count-based attenuation correction of dynamic posterior view gastric emptying scintigraphy with continuous acquisition in children,Xinhua Cao; Xiaoyin Xu; Laura Drubach; Frederic H Fahey,Abstract Background When performing dynamic gastric emptying scintigraphy withcontinuous acquisition in children; a single posterior view acquisition is preferred because itallows the young patient to more easily interact with a parent or technologist even thoughthis method tends toward overestimating gastric emptying. Objectives The objective of ourstudy was to develop a new attenuation correction (AC) method to improve the accuracy ofthe time activity curve and the measurement of residual gastric emptying from 1-h posteriorimages of gastric emptying scintigraphy with continuous acquisition. Materials and methodsWe developed a frame-count-based AC for gastric emptying scintigraphy from the posteriorview (posterior AC method).

Reducing Uncertainty of Probabilistic Top-$ k $ Ranking via Pairwise Crowdsourcing,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Zhe Fan,Probabilistic top-$ k $ ranking is an important and well-studied query operator in uncertaindatabases. However; the quality of top-$ k $ results might be heavily affected by theambiguity and uncertainty of the underlying data. Uncertainty reduction techniques havebeen proposed to improve the quality of top-$ k $ results by cleaning the original data.Unfortunately; most data cleaning models aim to probe the exact values of the objectsindividually and therefore do not work well for subjective data types; such as user ratings;which are inherently probabilistic. In this paper; we propose a novel pairwise crowdsourcingmodel to reduce the uncertainty of top-$ k $ ranking using a crowd of domain experts. Givena crowdsourcing task of limited budget; we propose efficient algorithms to select the bestobject pairs for crowdsourcing that will bring in the highest quality improvement …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*

Cornealneovascularization (NV) is one of the most common pathologies in corneal diseases;leading to vision loss or even blindness. However; even though different treatments forcorneal NV are available; a safe and effective therapy remains to be an unmet medicalchallenge.

Cluster statistics and quasisoliton dynamics in microscopic optimal-velocity models,Bo Yang; Xihua Xu; John ZF Pang; Christopher Monterola,Abstract Using the non-linear optimal velocity models as an example; we show that thereexists an emergent intrinsic scale that characterizes the interaction strength betweenmultiple clusters appearing in the solutions of such models. The interaction characterizes thedynamics of the localized quasisoliton structures given by the time derivative of theheadways; and the intrinsic scale is analogous to the “charge” of the quasisolitons; leadingto non-trivial cluster statistics from the random perturbations to the initial steady states ofuniform headways. The cluster statistics depend both on the quasisoliton charge and thedensity of the traffic. The intrinsic scale is also related to an emergent quantity that gives theextremum headways in the cluster formation; as well as the coexistence curve separatingthe absolute stable phase from the metastable phase.

Nature of the Congested Traffic and Quasi-steady States of the General Motor Models,Bo Yang; Xihua Xu; John ZF Pang; Christopher Monterola,Abstract We look at the general motor (GM) class microscopic traffic models and analyzesome of the universal features of the (multi-) cluster solutions; including the emergence of anintrinsic scale and the quasisoliton dynamics. We show that the GM models can capture theessential physics of the real traffic dynamics; especially the phase transition from the freeflow to the congested phase; from which the wide moving jams emerges (the FSJ transitionpioneered by BS Kerner). In particular; the congested phase can be associated with eitherthe multi-cluster quasi-steady states; or their more homogeneous precursor states. In bothcases the states can last for a long time; and the narrow clusters will eventually grow andmerge; leading to the formation of the wide moving jams.

How the white tiger lost its color; but kept its stripes,Xiao Xu; Shu-Jin Luo,The fantastic range of animal coloration is produced by pigment particles of colored materialor microscopic structures in scales; bristles or feathers that give rise to brilliant iridescentcolors. In mammals; except for a few exceptions involving nano-or micro-scale structuralcolor (eg; the blue faces of male baboons); fur color is determined by the pigment melanin.Melanin is synthesized and stored in melanosomes; a lysosomal organelle of melanocyte;and transferred to adjacent keratinocytes and hairs. There are two types of melanin:eumelanin (black to brown) and pheomelanin (red to yellow). The amount; ratio anddistribution of eumelanin and pheomelanin in hair determine the coat color of an animal:everything from bright white to light cream to red to jet black.

Cluster Statistics and Quasisoliton Dynamics in Microscopic Car-following Models,Bo Yang; Xihua Xu; John ZF Pang; Christopher Monterola,Abstract: Using the optimal velocity (OV) model as an example; we show that in the non-linear regime there is an emergent quantity that gives the extremum headways in the clusterformation; as well as the coexistence curve separating the absolute stable phase from themetastable phase. This emergent quantity is independent of the density of the traffic lane;and determines an intrinsic scale that characterizes the dynamics of localized quasisolitonstructures given by the time derivative of the headways. The intrinsic scale is analogous tothe" charge" of quasisolitons that controls the strength of interaction between multipleclusters; leading to non-trivial cluster statistics from random perturbations to initial uniformtraffic. The cluster statistics depend both on the charge and the density of the traffic lane; therelationship is qualitatively universal for general car-following models.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1407.3177,2014,*

Data sweeper: A proactive filtering framework for error-bounded sensor data collection,Dan Wang; Jiangchuan Liu; Jianliang Xu,In this paper; we develop a novel framework that attempts to reduce network traffic for error-bounded data collection in wireless sensor networks. In many sensor applications; it isacceptable that the monitoring results evaluated based on collected data might deviate fromthe exact results; as long as the error is bounded by a certain threshold. One well-knowntechnique for error-bounded data collection is data filtering; which explores temporal datacorrelation to suppress data updates. A concrete scheme was proposed in [1]. The datacollection is divided in rounds. A filter is installed on each node and the total filter size isconstrained by the user-specified error budget. Intuitively; if the data change from the lastupdate report is smaller than the filter size; the current update is suppressed; ie; not to reportto the base station. To adapt to system dynamics; the sizes of all filters are periodically …,Quality of Service (IWQoS); 2010 18th International Workshop on,2010,*

It usually results in several macroblock lines; a whole frame or evenmultiple successive frame loss that is difficult to be corrected by conventional error correctingtechniques. This paper proposes a robust video coding scheme; which consists of threesteps: 1) spatial decimation divides each frame into two similar fields which can be used tocorrect each other by spatial error concealment; 2) field-level Alternative Multi-hypothesisMotion Compensated Prediction (AMCP) makes the error from even top fields and oddbottom fields decrease and converge to zero quickly and automatically and 3) temporalinterleaving is applied to disperse burst error to different frames which further enhances theerror concealment capability to up to three successive lost frames.

Theconcept of EDE was first introduced in 1977 and then revised in 1990; when the name waschanged to effective dose; however; the US Nuclear Regulatory Agency (US NRC) has onlyadopted the former definition in the United States. 1; 2 The effective dose provides atechnical basis to compare the radiation health risk with other kinds of risks. The samemagnitude of effective dose can be assumed to produce the same degree of health risksirrespective of the organs or tissues involved in irradiation. Effective dose is defined as aweighted average of the doses to many organs and tissues in the body. It is not possible …,Handbook of Anatomical Models for Radiation Dosimetry.

Decomposition of 14C labeled pyrogenic carbon and its incorporation into soil microbial biomass estimated during 4 years incubation,Y Kuzyakov; I Subbotina; H Chen; I Bogomolova; X Xu,Abstract Incomplete combustion of organics (vegetation or fossil fuel) led to accumulation ofcharred products in soils. Such charred and pyrogenic products; frequently called blackcarbon (BC); may act as an important long-term carbon (C) sink because its microbialdecomposition and chemical transformation is very slow. Direct estimations of BCdecomposition rates are absent. Estimations based on total CO2 efflux are unsuitablebecause the contribution of BC to CO2 is too small compared to soil organic matter (SOM).We produced BC by charring 14C labeled residues of perennial ryegrass and incubated this14C labeled BC in a Haplic Luvisol or in loess. The decomposition rates of BC wereestimated based on 14CO2 sampled 46 times during the 3.8-years incubation period.

WE‐C‐224A‐05: Patient Modeling and Organ Dose Calculations Using Monte Carlo Methods,XG Xu; H Paganetti,Abstract The risk for a patient to develop secondary cancers from non-target exposures canbe assessed from the equivalent doses to various radiosensitive organs. To determineorgan doses; a computational model or physical phantom that represents the whole patientanatomy must be used. Physical phantoms (such as the RANDO and ATOM phantoms) havetiny cavities on each of the tissue-equivalent slices for inserting TL and MOSFET dosimeters.When beam is delivered according to a patient's treatment plan; the dosimeters areprocessed to provide organ dose information. The experimental procedures can be time-consuming and expensive; especially when various patients and treatment plans arestudies. Virtual patient models; on the other hand; can be combined with a Monte Carlo codeto simulate the transport of radiation in the body. These models cover the entire body and …,Medical Physics,2006,*
SU‐FF‐T‐162: Development of a Patient‐Specific Lung Phantom Using 3D Imaging and Rapid Prototyping,J Hanlon; M Oakley; B Bednarz; X George Xu,Purpose: Physical human phantoms have been widely used in verification of externalradiotherapy treatment plans; study of exposures outside of the target regions; andcalibration of whole-body counter for nuclear medicine procedures and for radiation safetybioassays. Existing phantoms are mostly crude in anatomical representations; althoughrealistic 3D images of patients are available. This paper presents a method of fabricating aphysical phantom of the lung using patient-specific medical images and computer aideddesign (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM). Methods: Medical images have been used toconstruct the VIP-Man model from Visible Human images. The voxelized data from the lungof VIP-Man were translated into 3D polygon mesh models. The models were then correctedand scaled to the actual size of the organ. A 3D rapid prototyping machine (ie; a 3D …,Medical Physics,2006,*
SU‐FF‐T‐317: Measured and Simulated Non‐Target Whole‐Body Doses for Selected IMRT and 3D‐CRT Treatment Plans,B Bednarz; X George Xu; B Wang,Purpose: A symposium at this year's APPM Summer Meeting calls for the attention to the non-target exposures during emerging modalities. The change from 3D-CRT to IMRT has beenaccompanied by many new challenges including a potential for an increase in secondmalignancies due to more fields and longer exposure times. The goal of this study is toestablish a robust method for comparing in-phantom measurements and Monte Carlosimulations of whole body doses resulting from 3D-CRT and IMRT treatment plans. Methodand Materials: Measurements using a RANDO phantom and MOSFET dosimeters were re-constructed to determine organ doses from three typical treatment plans; 4-field 3D-CRT; 6-Field 3D-CRT; and 7-Field IMRT for the prostate.

There are three reasons for its success: the requirement of that society;the merits of Esperanto; and the good for the common ideal of human being. Also; there arethree reasons for the failure: The first is the reasonable existence of Chinese character and itis impossible for Esperanto to substitute Chinese character; the second is not long time ofEsperanto in China and Chinese don't know it well; the third is no coincidence of the aim ofEsperanto people.,Journal of Xichang College (Social Science Edition),2006,*

Performance evaluation of air indexing schemes for multi-attribute data broadcast,Qing Gao; Shanping Li; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In this paper; we study power conservation techniques for multi-attribute queries ina wireless data broadcast environment. Most existing indexing techniques are based on acentralized tree structure and thus are inefficient for sequential-access wireless broadcastmedia. To conserve energy for mobile devices while maintaining acceptable data accesslatency; we extend the exponential index for single-attribute queries to multi-attributequeries. By maintaining a distributed structure and making full use of indexing space; theexponential index can reduce the energy consumption considerably. We conductexperiments to evaluate the performance of the extended exponential index against the well-known distributed tree index. The results show that the exponential index achieves a betterperformance than the index tree method.,International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems,2005,*

The multi-drug resistant model ofminimal residual leukemia was established by using P388/VCR-G cell line expressingenhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and DBA mice. The results showed thatP388/VCR-G were inoculated in the abdominal cavities of DBA mice; the incidence ofleukemia was 100%. Any of these mice with leukemia could not obtain remissionspontaneously. The model of leukemia was sensitive to cyclophosphamide (Cy) and thetime of survival was related to the dose of Cy received. The logarithm of cells inoculated inmice correlated regressionally with the dose of Cy. So this model was ideal for research onminimal residual leukemia.

Soil moisture prediction based on retrievals from satellite sensing and a regional climate model,Huailiang Chen; Xiangde Xu; Yujie Liu; Yusheng Li; Shitao Wang,Soil moisture is an inegligible physical variable in agrometeorology; climatology; hydrology;ecology and crop cultivation and predicted normally by use of the Penman formula formeteorological records from a single or a few stations and weather forecasts. This method;however; allows to make the prediction only for a limited number of stations rather thanregional gridded predictions. For this reason; we developed a scheme of satellite sensingsretrieval; the regional climate model (RegCM2) and a soil water predicting model incombination for moisture in fields of staple crops over the Huang-Huai Plains; by which toestablish a drought warning system; of which 1) the soil water predicting model makes useof the soil moisture balance equation applicable to fields of winter wheat and summer cornin the Plains; whose central component is the Penman formula revised by FAO; 2) the …,Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability II,2005,*
Studies on the ultraviolet-light-induced absorption changes in congruent LiNbO 3: Mg,Bo Fu; Guoquan Zhang; Lubing Zhao; Haijun Qiao; Qingjun Xu; Yan Shen; Jingjun Xu; Yongfa Kong; Jun Sun; Shaolin Chen,Abstract By measuring the ultraviolet-light-induced absorption coefficient changes and theultraviolet-light-gated two-color recording sensitivity at 633 nm; we found that the ultraviolet-light-induced absorption coefficient changes in congruent LiNbO< sub> 3</sub>: Mg has athreshold effect with respect to the Mg-doping concentration. It is only when theconcentration of Mg is more than 3.0 mol.% that the ultraviolet-light-induced absorptioncoefficient changes can be observed. This threshold value is lower than the well-knowndamage-resistant threshold value of 4.6 mol.% for Mg in congruent LiNbO< sub> 3</sub>:Mg. We attribute the appearance of the ultraviolet-light-induced absorption coefficientchanges to the elimination of the antisite defect Nb< sub> Li</sub> and the formation of O<sup>-</sup> where a hole is trapped at a O< sup> 2-</sup> site near a negatively …,Photorefractive Effects; Materials; and Devices,2005,*

Comparison of two-color holography between congruent and near-stoichiometric LiNbO 3: Fe at low intensities,Yan Shen; Guoquan Zhang; Bo Fu; Qingjun Xu; Jingjun Xu,We have studied theoretically the steady-state nonvolatile two-step; two-color holographicrecording performance for both the congruent and the near-stoichiometric LiNbO 3: Febased on the two-center model (the deep-trap and the shallow-trap centers are Fe 2+/Fe 3+and Nb Li 4+/Nb Li 5+; respectively). We compare the amplitudes of the total space-chargefields and the recording sensitivities between the congruent and the near-stoichiometricLiNbO 3: Fe. The results show that the amplitudes of the total space-charge fields in near-stoichiometric LiNbO 3: Fe are larger than that of congruent ones by at least one order ofmagnitude; while the recording sensitivities of the near-stoichiometric LiNbO 3: Fe areconfirmed theoretically to be around two-order in magnitude higher than that of thecongruent ones with the same experimental conditions at low intensity region.,Nonlinear Optical Phenomena and Applications,2005,*

A multifrequency phase-controlled driving system for ultrasound therapy,QJ Dai; QW Zhou; XZ Xu; Ou Yang KY; ZZ Bian,Abstract Ultrasound therapy is a new type of therapy technology; there are hyperthermia andhigh intensity focused ultrasound surgery (HIFUS). Compared with a single frequencysystem; mutiple frequency system has an additional function to combine power patterns ofdifferent frequencies. This function increases the availability of power patterns to treat tumorsof various shapes and depths. Therefore; we have in this article proposed a system with theability to drive ultrasonic phased arrays of multiple resonant frequencies for ultrasoundhyperthermia and HIFUS. The results show that this system is able to (1) drive multi-elementapplicators or phased arrays of a single resonant frequency through the multichannel poweramplifiers;(2) concurrently drive transducer with different resonant frequencies;(3) adjust therelative phase and output power of each channel for the scanning ultrasonic focus; and (4 …,Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi= Chinese journal of medical instrumentation,2002,*

A Multicriterion Ranking Procedure Based on Distance Between Partial Preorders,Xiaozhan Xu; Bernard Lamond; Jean-Marc Martel,Abstract In this paper; a multicriterion ranking procedure based on distance between partialpreorders is proposed. This method consists of two phases. In the first phase; the decisionmaker is asked to rank alternatives with a preorder (complete or partial) for each criterionand provide complete or partial linear information about the relative importance (weights) ofthe criteria. In the second phase; we introduce a distance procedure to aggregate the aboveindividual rankings into a global ranking (a partial preorder). An algorithm for theaggregation procedure is proposed; followed by a numerical illustration.,*,1999,*

LEE; Wang-chien; and LEE; Dik Lun. The D-tree: An Index Structure for Planar Point Queries Location-Based Wireless Services.(2004),Jianliang XU; Baihua ZHENG,Abstract Location-based services (LBSs); considered as a killer application in the wirelessdata market; provides information based on locations specified in the queries. In this paper;we examine the indexing issues for querying location-dependent data in wireless LBSs; inparticular; we focus on an important class of queries; planar point queries. To address theissues of scalability; energy consumption; bandwidth contention in wireless communicationand mobile computing; an index; whether it is designed for on-demand access or periodicalbroadcast of data; has to minimize the search time and maintains a small index size. It isshown that the traditional point-location algorithms and spatial index structures fail at eitherobjective or both. This paper proposes an innovative index structure; called D-tree; whichindexes spatial regions based on the divisions that form the boundaries of the regions …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,*,*

Influence of dopants on nonvolatile holographic storage in lithium niobate,Bo Fu; Guo-Quan Zhang; Xiang-Ming Liu; Yan Shen; Qing-Jun Xu; Yong-Fa Kong; Shao-Lin Chen; Jing-Jun Xu,通过研究掺镁; 掺锌和掺铟同成分铌酸锂晶体的紫外+ 红光双色全息存储性能;发现双色记录响应时间均比单色记录时明显缩短; 最多的可减小3 个数量级;双色记录灵敏度大幅度提高; 在掺镁5 mol.% 的晶体中可达到1.1 cm/J. 在掺杂浓度超过抗光损伤阈值的铌酸锂晶体中; 均可实现非挥发全息存储. 但是; 在掺镁; 锌样品中; 深;浅能级中心上的光栅反相; 而在掺铟样品中则表现为同相. 这是由于掺杂离子的种类不同;在铌酸锂晶体中形成的缺陷中心也不同所引起的.,*,*,*
A New Method for Experimental Determination of Compressional Velocities in Rocks and Minerals at High-Pressure" LIU Yong-Gang (kilk]])"; XIE Hong-Sen (j)"; GU...,Wen-Ge ZHOU; Ji-An XU; Zhi-Dan ZHAO,A transmission-reflection-combined new method is presented for neasuring elastic velocitiesof rocks and minerals at elevated temperature and pressure; which resolves the problems ofgradients of temperature and pressure existing in original sample assembly with apyrophyllite cube. At room temperature and pressure up to 3 GPa; single-crystal quartz andeclogite were used to provide samples under test; respectively. The results of this workagree with the previous measuremcnts very well within the error range. By the use of thisnew technique; more precise and reasonable data of elastic properties of rocks and mincralsat elevated temperature and pressure can be achieved.,*,*,*

Uncertainty in high and low flows due to parameter and model structure errors,Ye Tian; Martijn J Booij; Yue-Ping Xu,4. Results The results show that the three models perform well. The observed dailydischarge is mostly captured by the 90% confidence intervals for all three models; howeverthe 90% confidence intervals do not cover the extreme flows for the Xinanjiang model.Figure 1 shows that for extreme high flows; the bias is the largest for the Xinanjiang modeland the smallest for HBV. The uncertainty in high flows increases with the magnitude of thedischarge. This is most obvious for the HBV model; followed by GR4J and Xinanjiang. Theparameter uncertainty in high flows is the largest in the HBV model and the smallest inXinanjiang.,*,*,*

Monte Carlo modeling of respiration-related proton range fluctuation using a time-resolved proton range telescope for proton treatment,XG Xu; B Han; A Ding; B Bednarz; GT Chen; KV Riper,Real-time monitoring of respiration-caused range discrepancy offers an opportunity to refineproton treatment planning; delivery and assessment. A novel device called'time-resolvedrange telescope (TRRT)'can be used to create a proton radiographic image in a specialrange detector for the purpose of reconstructing the range information for the patient. Thispaper describes a Monte Carlo study to develop computer algorithms for rangereconstruction. Simulations were performed in the MCNPX code whose particle trackingfeatures are activated. Patient-specific 4D CT phantoms were used to simulate 10respiratory phases in a free-breathing mode. A range-energy reconstruction algorithm isdeveloped to calculate'water equivalent length (WEL)'values in the patient phantoms usingresponses recorded in a range detector that is made of 3-mm layers of materials.

There was a spatial trend in length at 50% maturity withnorthernmost (2J) fish maturing at the smallest size. The spatial trend in the age at 50%maturity is not as clear as length; but the age at 50% maturity in Division 3L was larger thanthat in 2J and 3K in 7 and 8 of 10 years; respectively. _ The age at 50% maturity did notshow a temporal trend; but the length at 50% maturity showed a decline trend over time in allthree regions. The likelihood ratio tests show that the age at 50% maturity changed verysignificantly from year to year in the period of 1981 to 1990; and that the length at 50 …,*,*,*

Page STEP—Compliant NC Research: the Search for Intelligent CAD/CAPP/CAM/CNC Integration,XW Xu; H Wang; J Mao; ST Newman; TR Kramer; FM Proctor; JL Michaloski,Abstract Since the first generation of NC machine tools was developed in the 1950's; therehave been many developments which make today's NC machines completelyunrecognisable from their early ancestors. Further developments; however; are now beingsignificantly limited by the current programming language (ISO6983; or RS274D) that hasbeen supporting NC manufacture since day one. Today a new standard; informally knownas STEP-NC; is being used as the basis for development of the next generation of CNCcontroller. This new standard is ISO 14649 and ISO 10303 AP 238. This standard gives CAMand CNC vendors the opportunity to integrate the capabilities of CAD/CAM systems with anew breed of intelligent CNC controllers; which has bi-directional communication ofinformation representing standardised geometric and manufacturing data.

Selectivity Estimation of XPath for Cyclic Graphs,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,ABSTRACT Recent interests on the Semantic Web; Web ontology and XML; among othertopics; have sparked a renewed interest on graph-structured databases. Path queries areoften used to retrieve graph-structured data (or simply graphs) from the database. A crucialand classical query optimization has been query selectivity estimation. However; themajority of existing works on selectivity estimation focuses on relational and tree data. In thispaper; we investigate selectivity estimation on path queries on possibly cyclic graph data. Tofacilitate selectivity estimation on cyclic graphs; we propose a matrix representation ofgraphs extended from prime labeling; an index for reachability queries on directed acyclicgraphs. With this representation; we exploit consecutive ones property (C1P) of matrix. As aconsequence; a node is mapped to a point in a 2-dimensional plane and a query is …,*,*,*
11 Data Broadcast,JIANLIANG XU; DIKLUN LEE,We have been witnessing in the past few years the rapid growth of wireless dataapplications in the commercial market thanks to the advent of wireless devices; wirelesshigh-speed networks; and supporting software technologies. We envisage that in the nearfuture; a large number of mobile users carrying portable devices (eg; palmtops; laptops;PDAs; WAP phones; etc.) will be able to access a variety of information from anywhere andat any time. The types of information that may become accessible wirelessly are boundless;and include news; stock quotes; airline schedules; and weather and traffic information; toname but a few. There are two fundamental information delivery methods for wireless dataapplications: point-to-point access and broadcast. In point-to-point access; a logical channelis established between the client and the server. Queries are submitted to the server and …,*,*,*
