Querying regular graph patterns,Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin; Juan L Reutter,Abstract Graph data appears in a variety of application domains; and many uses of it; suchas querying; matching; and transforming data; naturally result in incompletely specifiedgraph data; that is; graph patterns. While queries need to be posed against such data;techniques for querying patterns are generally lacking; and properties of such queries arenot well understood. Our goal is to study the basics of querying graph patterns. The keyfeatures of patterns we consider here are node and label variables and edges specified byregular expressions. We provide a classification of patterns; and study standard graphqueries on graph patterns. We give precise characterizations of both data and combinedcomplexity for each class of patterns. If complexity is high; we do further analysis of featuresthat lead to intractability; as well as lower-complexity restrictions. Since our patterns are …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2014,79
Data exchange beyond complete data,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter,Abstract In the traditional data exchange setting; source instances are restricted to becomplete in the sense that every fact is either true or false in these instances. Althoughnatural for a typical database translation scenario; this restriction is gradually becoming animpediment to the development of a wide range of applications that need to exchangeobjects that admit several interpretations. In particular; we are motivated by two specificapplications that go beyond the usual data exchange scenario: exchanging incompleteinformation and exchanging knowledge bases. In this article; we propose a generalframework for data exchange that can deal with these two applications. More specifically; weaddress the problem of exchanging information given by representation systems; which areessentially finite descriptions of (possibly infinite) sets of complete instances. We make …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2013,45
Relative Expressiveness of Nested Regular Expressions.,Pablo Barceló; Jorge Pérez; Juan L Reutter,Abstract. Nested regular expressions (NREs) have been proposed as a powerful formalismfor querying RDFS graphs; but not too much investigation on NREs has been pursued in amore general graph database context. In this paper we study the relative expressiveness ofNREs by comparing it with the language of conjunctive regular path queries (CR-PQs);which is one of the most widely studied query languages for graph databases. Among otherresults; we show that NREs and CRPQs are incomparable in terms of expressive power; butNREs properly extend the language of acyclic CRPQs. Even more; there is a naturalfragment of NREs that coincide in expressive power with the class of acyclic CRPQs. Ourresults; plus previous results that show that NREs can be evaluated in linear time incombined complexity; put forward NREs as a query language for graph-structured data …,AMW,2012,40
SPARQL with property paths,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Miguel Romero; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract The original SPARQL proposal was often criticized for its inability to navigatethrough the structure of RDF documents. For this reason property paths were introduced inSPARQL 1.1; but up to date there are no theoretical studies examining how their addition tothe language affects main computational tasks such as query evaluation; query containment;and query subsumption. In this paper we tackle all of these problems and show thatalthough the addition of property paths has no impact on query evaluation; they do make thecontainment and subsumption problems substantially more difficult.,International Semantic Web Conference,2015,38
Trial for RDF: adapting graph query languages for RDF data,Leonid Libkin; Juan Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract Querying RDF data is viewed as one of the main applications of graph querylanguages; and yet the standard model of graph databases--essentially labeled graphs--isdifferent from the triples-based model of RDF. While encodings of RDF databases into graphdata exist; we show that even the most natural ones are bound to lose some functionalitywhen used in conjunction with graph query languages. The solution is to work directly withtriples; but then many properties taken for granted in the graph database context (eg;reachability) lose their natural meaning. Our goal is to introduce languages that work directlyover triples and are closed; ie; they produce sets of triples; rather than graphs. Our basiclanguage is called TriAL; or Triple Algebra: it guarantees closure properties by replacing theproduct with a family of join operations. We extend TriAL with recursion; and explain why …,Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of database systems,2013,38
Foundations of schema mapping management,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan L Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract In the last few years; a lot of attention has been paid to the specification andsubsequent manipulation of schema mappings; a problem which is of fundamentalimportance in metadata management. There have been many achievements in this area;and semantics have been defined for operators on schema mappings such as compositionand inverse. However; little research has been pursued towards providing formal tools tocompare schema mappings; in terms of their ability to transfer data and avoid storingredundant information; which has hampered the development of foundations for morecomplex operators as many of them involve these notions. In this paper; we address theproblem of providing foundations for metadata management by developing an order tocompare the amount of information transferred by schema mappings. From this order we …,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2010,36
Query languages for data exchange: Beyond unions of conjunctive queries,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Juan Reutter,Abstract The class of unions of conjunctive queries (UCQ) has been shown to be particularlywell-behaved for data exchange; its certain answers can be computed in polynomial time (interms of data complexity). However; this is not the only class with this property; the certainanswers to any Datalog program can also can be computed in polynomial time. The problemis that both UCQ and Datalog do not allow negated atoms; as adding an unrestricted form ofnegation to these languages yields to intractability. In this paper; we propose a languagecalled Datalog C (≠) that extends Datalog with a restricted form of negation; and study someof its fundamental properties. In particular; we show that the certain answers to a Datalog C(≠) program can be computed in polynomial time (in terms of data complexity); and thatevery union of conjunctive queries with at most one inequality or negated relational atom …,Theory of Computing Systems,2011,34
Composition and inversion of schema mappings,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,A schema mapping is a specification that describes how data from a source schema is to bemapped to a target schema. Schema mappings have proved to be essential for data-interoperability tasks such as data exchange and data integration. The research on this areahas mainly focused on performing these tasks. However; as Bernstein pointed out [7]; manyinformation-system problems involve not only the design and integration of complexapplication artifacts; but also their subsequent manipulation. Driven by this consideration;Bernstein proposed in [7] a general framework for managing schema mappings. In thisframework; mappings are usually specified in a logical language; and high-level algebraicoperators are used to manipulate them [7; 16; 33; 12; 8]. Two of the most fundamentaloperators in this framework are the composition and inversion of schema mappings …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,31
Inverting schema mappings: bridging the gap between theory and practice,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract The inversion of schema mappings has been identified as one of the fundamentaloperators for the development of a general framework for metadata management. In fact;during the last years three alternative notions of inversion for schema mappings have beenproposed (Fagin-inverse [10]; quasi-inverse [14] and maximum recovery [2]). However; theprocedures that have been developed for computing these operators have some featuresthat limit their practical applicability. First; these algorithms work in exponential time andproduce inverse mappings of exponential size. Second; these algorithms express inversesin some mappings languages which include features that are difficult to use in practice. Atypical example is the use of disjunction in the conclusion of the mapping rules; whichmakes the process of exchanging data much more complicated. In this paper; we propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,31
Foundations of JSON schema,Felipe Pezoa; Juan L Reutter; Fernando Suarez; Martín Ugarte; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract JSON--the most popular data format for sending API requests and responses--is stilllacking a standardized schema or meta-data definition that allows the developers to specifythe structure of JSON documents. JSON Schema is an attempt to provide a general purposeschema language for JSON; but it is still work in progress; and the formal specification hasnot yet been agreed upon. Why this could be a problem becomes evident when examiningthe behaviour of numerous tools for validating JSON documents against this initial schemaproposal: although they agree on most general cases; when presented with the greyer areasof the specification they tend to differ significantly. In this paper we provide the first formaldefinition of syntax and semantics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementingthis layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice. This is done both by analysing the …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,28
Regular queries on graph databases,Juan L Reutter; Miguel Romero; Moshe Y Vardi,Abstract Graph databases are currently one of the most popular paradigms for storing data.One of the key conceptual differences between graph and relational databases is the focuson navigational queries that ask whether some nodes are connected by paths satisfyingcertain restrictions. This focus has driven the definition of several different query languagesand the subsequent study of their fundamental properties. We define the graph querylanguage of Regular Queries; which is a natural extension of unions of conjunctive 2-wayregular path queries (UC2RPQs) and unions of conjunctive nested 2-way regular pathqueries (UCN2RPQs). Regular queries allow expressing complex regular patterns betweennodes. We formalize regular queries as nonrecursive Datalog programs extended with thetransitive closure of binary predicates. This language has been previously considered …,Theory of Computing Systems,2017,25
Containment of Data Graph Queries.,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoc,ABSTRACT The graph database model is currently one of the most popular paradigms forstoring data; used in applications such as social networks; biological databases and theSemantic Web. Despite the popularity of this model; the development of graph databasemanagement systems is still in its infancy; and there are several fundamental issuesregarding graph databases that are not fully understood. Indeed; while graph querylanguages that concentrate on topological properties are now well developed; not much isknown about languages that can query both the topology of graphs and their underlyingdata. Our goal is to conduct a detailed study of static analysis problems for such languages.In this paper we consider the containment problem for several recently proposed classes ofqueries that manipulate both topology and data: regular queries with memory; regular …,ICDT,2014,24
Foundations of Modern Query Languages for Graph Databases,Renzo Angles; Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Aidan Hogan; Juan Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract We survey foundational features underlying modern graph query languages. Wefirst discuss two popular graph data models: edge-labelled graphs; where nodes areconnected by directed; labelled edges; and property graphs; where nodes and edges canfurther have attributes. Next we discuss the two most fundamental graph queryingfunctionalities: graph patterns and navigational expressions. We start with graph patterns; inwhich a graph-structured query is matched against the data. Thereafter; we discussnavigational expressions; in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph tonavigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions havebeen proposed and how they can be combined with graph patterns. We also discuss severalsemantics under which queries using the previous features can be evaluated; what …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2017,23
Schema mappings and data exchange for graph databases,Pablo Barceló; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter,Abstract Data exchange and schema mapping management have received little attention sofar in the graph database scenario; and tools developed in this context for relationaldatabases have significant drawbacks in the context of graph-structured data. In this paperwe embark on the study of interoperability issues for graph databases; including schemamappings; data exchange and certain answers computation. We start by analyzing differentpossibilities for specifying mappings in graph databases. Our mapping languages are basedon the most typical graph databases queries; ranging from regular path queries toconjunctions of nested regular expressions. They subsume all previously consideredmapping languages; and let one express many data exchange scenarios in the graphdatabase context.

CONSTRUCT queries in SPARQL,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Martín Ugarte,Abstract SPARQL has become the most popular language for querying RDF datasets; thestandard data model for representing information in the Web. This query language hasreceived a good deal of attention in the last few years: two versions of W3C standards havebeen issued; several SPARQL query engines have been deployed; and importanttheoretical foundations have been laid. However; many fundamental aspects of SPARQLqueries are not yet fully understood. To this end; it is crucial to understand thecorrespondence between SPARQL and well-developed frameworks like relational algebraor first order logic. But one of the main obstacles on the way to such understanding is the factthat the well-studied fragments of SPARQL do not produce RDF as output. In this paper weembark on the study of SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries; that is; queries which output RDF …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2015,20
Parameterized regular expressions and their languages,Pablo Barceló; Juan Reutter; Leonid Libkin,Abstract We study regular expressions that use variables; or parameters; which areinterpreted as alphabet letters. We consider two classes of languages denoted by suchexpressions: under the possibility semantics; a word belongs to the language if it is denotedby some regular expression obtained by replacing variables with letters; under the certaintysemantics; the word must be denoted by every such expression. Such languages areregular; and we show that they naturally arise in several applications such as queryinggraph databases and program analysis. As the main contribution of the paper; we provide acomplete characterization of the complexity of the main computational problems related tosuch languages: nonemptiness; universality; containment; membership; as well as theproblem of constructing NFAs capturing such languages. We also look at the extension …,Theoretical Computer Science,2013,18
Tractable XML data exchange via relations,Rada Chirkova; Leonid Libkin; Juan L Reutter,Abstract We consider data exchange for XML documents: given source and target schemas;a mapping between them; and a document conforming to the source schema; construct atarget document and answer target queries in a way that is consistent with sourceinformation. The problem has primarily been studied in the relational context; in which data-exchange systems have also been built. Since many XML documents are stored in relations;it is natural to consider using a relational system for XML data exchange. However; there is acomplexity mismatch between query answering in relational and XML data exchange; whichindicates that restrictions have to be imposed on XML schemas and mappings; and on XMLshredding schemes; to make the use of relational systems possible. We isolate a set of fiverequirements that must be fulfilled in order to have a faithful representation of the XML …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on information and knowledge management,2011,16
The language of plain SO-tgds: Composition; inversion and structural properties,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract The problems of composing and inverting schema mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies (st-tgds) have attracted a lot of attention; as they are offundamental importance for the development of Bernsteinʼs metadata managementframework. In the case of the composition operator; a natural semantics has been proposedand the language of second-order tuple generating dependencies (SO-tgds) has beenidentified as the right language to express it. In the case of the inverse operator; severalsemantics have been proposed; most notably the maximum recovery; the only inversenotion that guarantees that every mapping specified by st-tgds is invertible. Unfortunately;less attention has been paid to combining both operators; which is the motivation of thispaper. More precisely; we start our investigation by showing that SO-tgds are not good for …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,15

Containment of nested regular expressions,Juan L Reutter,Abstract: Nested regular expressions (NREs) have been proposed as a powerful formalismfor querying RDFS graphs; but research in a more general graph database context has beenscarce; and static analysis results are currently lacking. In this paper we investigate theproblem of containment of NREs; and show that it can be solved in PSPACE; ie; the samecomplexity as the problem of containment of regular expressions or regular path queries(RPQs).

Complexity of answering counting aggregate queries over DL-Lite,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter,Abstract The ontology based data access model assumes that users access data by meansof an ontology; which is often described in terms of description logics. As a consequence;languages for managing ontologies now need algorithms not only to decide standardreasoning problems; but also to answer database-like queries. However; fundamentaldatabase aggregate queries; such as the ones using functions COUNT and COUNTDISTINCT; have received very little attention in this context; and even defining appropriatesemantics for their answers over ontologies appears to be a non-trivial task. Our goal is tostudy the problem of answering database queries with aggregation in the context ofontologies. This paper presents an intuitive semantics for answering counting queries;followed by a comparison with similar approaches that have been taken in different …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2015,12
XPath for DL Ontologies.,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoc,Abstract Applications of description logics (DLs) such as ontologybased data access (OBDA)require understanding of how to pose database queries over DL knowledge bases. Whilethere have been many studies regarding traditional relational query formalisms such asconjunctive queries and their extensions; little attention has been paid to graph databasequeries; despite the fact that graph databases have essentially the same structure asknowledge bases. In particular; not much is known about the interplay between DLs andXPath. The latter is a powerful formalism for querying semistructured data: it is in the core ofmost practical query languages for XML trees; and it is also gaining popularity in theory andpractice of graph databases. In this paper we make a step towards coupling knowledgebases and graph databases by studying how to answer powerful XPath-style queries over …,AAAI,2015,12
Graph Patterns: Structure; Query Answering and Applications in Schema Mappings and Formal Language Theory,Juan L Reutter,Graph data appears in a variety of application domains; and many uses of it; such asquerying; matching; and transforming data; naturally result in incompletely specified graphdata; ie; graph patterns. Queries need to be posed against such data; but techniques forquerying patterns are generally lacking; and even simple properties of graph patterns; suchas the languages needed to specify them; are not well understood. In this dissertation wepresent several contributions in the study of graph patterns. We analyze how to query themand how to use them as queries. We also analyze some of their applications in two differentcontexts: schema mapping specification and data exchange for graph databases; and formallanguage theory. We first identify key features of patterns; such as node and label variablesand edges specified by regular expressions; and define a classification of patterns based …,*,2013,11
JSON: data model; query languages and schema specification,Pierre Bourhis; Juan L Reutter; Fernando Suárez; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract Despite the fact that JSON is currently one of the most popular formats forexchanging data on the Web; there are very few studies on this topic and there is noagreement upon a theoretical framework for dealing with JSON. Therefore in this paper wepropose a formal data model for JSON documents and; based on the common featurespresent in available systems using JSON; we define a lightweight query language allowingus to navigate through JSON documents. We also introduce a logic capturing the schemaproposal for JSON and study the complexity of basic computational tasks associated withthese two formalisms.,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,7
Query language-based inverses of schema mappings: semantics; computation; and closure properties,Marcelo Arenas; Jorge Pérez; Juan Reutter; Cristian Riveros,Abstract The inversion of schema mappings has been identified as one of the fundamentaloperators for the development of a general framework for metadata management. During thelast few years; three alternative notions of inversion for schema mappings have beenproposed (Fagin-inverse (Fagin; TODS 32 (4); 25: 1–25: 53; 2007); quasi-inverse (Fagin etal.; TODS 33 (2); 11: 1–11: 52; 2008); and maximum recovery (Arenas et al.; TODS 34 (4);22: 1–22: 48; 2009)). However; these notions lack some fundamental properties that limittheir practical applicability: most of them are expressed in languages including features thatare difficult to use in practice; some of these inverses are not guaranteed to exist formappings specified with source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies (st-tgds); and it hasbeen futile to search for a meaningful mapping language that is closed under any of these …,The VLDB Journal,2012,7
Static analysis of navigational XPath over graph databases,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract Most query languages for graph databases rely on exploring the topologicalproperties of the data by using paths. However; many applications require more complexpatterns to be matched against the graph to obtain desired results. For this reason a versionof the standard XML query language XPath has been adapted to work over graphs. In thispaper we study static analysis aspects of this language; concentrating on problems such ascontainment; equivalence and satisfiability. We show that for the full language all of theproblems are undecidable. By restricting the language we then obtain several naturalfragments whose complexity ranges from PSpace-complete to ExpTime-complete.,Information Processing Letters,2016,5

In this paper we introduce a logic for such graphs in which the domainis the set of edges. We compare its expressiveness with the standard logic in which thedomain the set of vertices. Furthermore; we introduce a robust model of computation for suchlogic; the so called graph pebble automata.,AMW,2011,5

Datalog as a query language for data exchange systems,Marcelo Arenas; Pablo Barceló; Juan Reutter,Abstract The class of unions of conjunctive queries (UCQ) has been shown to be particularlywell-behaved for data exchange; its certain answers can be computed in polynomial time (interms of data complexity). However; this is not the only class with this property; the certainanswers to any Datalog program can also can be computed in polynomial time. The problemis that both UCQ and Datalog do not allow for negated atoms; while most database querylanguages are equipped with negation. Unfortunately; adding an unrestricted form ofnegation to these languages yields to intractability of the problem of computing certainanswers. In order to face this challenge; we have recently proposed a language; calledDatalog C (≠)[5]; that extends Datalog with a restricted form of negation while keeping thegood properties of Datalog; and UCQ; for data exchange. In this article; we provide …,*,2011,4
Classification of annotation semirings over containment of conjunctive queries,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; András Z Salamon,Abstract We study the problem of query containment of conjunctive queries over annotateddatabases. Annotations are typically attached to tuples and represent metadata; such asprobability; multiplicity; comments; or provenance. It is usually assumed that annotations aredrawn from a commutative semiring. Such databases pose new challenges in queryoptimization; since many related fundamental tasks; such as query containment; have to bereconsidered in the presence of propagation of annotations. We axiomatize several classesof semirings for each of which containment of conjunctive queries is equivalent to existenceof a particular type of homomorphism. For each of these types; we also specify all semiringsfor which existence of a corresponding homomorphism is a sufficient (or necessary)condition for the containment. We develop new decision procedures for containment for …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,3
On Incomplete XML Documents with Integrity Constraints.,Pablo Barceló; Leonid Libkin; Juan L Reutter,Abstract. We consider incomplete specifications of XML documents in the presence ofschema information and integrity constraints. We show that integrity constraints such as keysand foreign keys affect consistency of such specifications. We prove that the consistencyproblem for incomplete specifications with keys and foreign keys can always be solved inNP. We then show a dichotomy result; classifying the complexity of the problem as NP-complete or PTIME; depending on the precise set of features used in incompletedescriptions.,AMW,2010,2
Incorporating API Data into SPARQL Query Answers.,Matias Junemann; Juan L Reutter; Adrián Soto; Domagoj Vrgoc,Abstract. In this demo we present an extension of SPARQL which allows queries to connectto JSON APIs and integrate the obtained information into query answers. We achieve this byadding a new operator to SPARQL; and implement this extension on top of the Jenaframework in order to illustrate how it functions with real world APIs.,International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos),2016,1
Property Paths over Linked Data: Can It Be Done and How To Start?,Jorge Baier; Dietrich Daroch; Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoc,Abstract. One of the advantages that Linked Data offers over the classical database setting isthe ability to connect and navigate through different datasets. At the moment the standardmechanism for exploring navigational properties of the Semantic Web data are SPARQLproperty paths. However; the semantics of property paths is only defined assuming oneevaluates them over a single local database; and it is still not clear what is the correct way toimplement them over the Web of Linked Data; nor if this is even feasible. In this paper weexplore this topic in more depth and gauge the merits of different approaches of executingproperty paths over Linked Data. To this end we test how property paths perform if theLinked Data is assumed to be available locally; through endpoints; or if it is accesseddirectly through dereferencing IRIs.,COLD@ ISWC,2016,1
Nested constructs vs. sub-selects in SPARQL,Axel Polleres; Juan Reutter; E Kostylev,Abstract: The issue of subqueries in SPARQL has appeared in different papers as anextension point to the original SPARQL query language. Particularly; nested CONSTRUCTin FROM clauses are a feature that has been discussed as a potential input for SPARQL 1.1which was resolved to be left out in favour of select subqueries under the-unproven-conjecture that such subqueries can express nested construct queries. In this paper; weshow that it is indeed possible to unfold nested SPARQL construct queries into subqueriesin SPARQL 1.1; our transformation; however; requires an exponential blowup in the nestingdepth. This suggests that nested construct queries are indeed a useful syntactic feature inSPARQL that cannot compactly be replaced by subqueries.,*,2016,1

Containment of queries for graphs with data,Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract We consider the containment problem for regular queries with memory and regularqueries with data tests: two recently proposed query languages for graph databases that; inaddition to allowing the user to ask topological queries; also track how the data changesalong paths connecting various points in the database. Our results show that the problem isundecidable in general. However; by allowing only positive data comparisons we findnatural fragments with better static analysis properties: the containment problem is PSpace-complete in the case of regular queries with data tests and ExpSpace-complete in the caseof regular queries with memory.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2018,*

Evaluating navigational RDF queries over the Web,Jorge Baier; Dietrich Daroch; Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract Semantic Web; and its underlying data format RDF; lend themselves naturally tonavigational querying due to their graph-like structure. This is particularly evident whenconsidering RDF data on the Web; where various separately published datasets referenceeach other and form a giant graph known as the Web of Linked Data. And while navigationalqueries over singular RDF datasets are supported through SPARQL property paths; notmuch is known about evaluating them over Linked Data. In this paper we propose a methodfor evaluating property path queries over the Web based on the classical AI search algorithmA*; show its optimality in the open world setting of the Web; and test it using real worldqueries which access a variety of RDF datasets available online and that are not necessarilyknown in advance.,Proceedings of the 28th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,2017,*

Our mainhypothesis is that for many data sets and common analysis tasks; there are relatively few"data slices" that result in effective visualizations. By focusing human users on appropriateand suitably transformed parts of the underlying data sets; these data slices can help theusers carry their task to correct completion. To verify this hypothesis; we develop aframework that permits us to capture exemplary data slices for a user task; and to exploreand parse visual-exploration sequences into a format that makes them distinct and easy tocompare.

Navigational and Rule-Based Languages for Graph Databases,Juan L Reutter; Domagoj Vrgoč,Abstract One of the key differences between graph and relational databases is that ongraphs we are much more interested in navigational queries. As a consequence; graphdatabase systems are specifically engineered to answer these queries efficiently; and thereis a wide body of work on query languages that can express complex navigational patterns.The most commonly used way to add navigation into graph queries is to start with a basicpattern matching language and augment it with navigational primitives based on regularexpressions. For example; the friend-of-a-friend relationship in a social network is expressedvia the primitive (friend)+; which looks for paths of nodes connected via the friend relation.This expression can be then added to graph patterns; allowing us to retrieve; for example; allnodes A; B and C that have a common friend-of-a-friend. But; in order to alleviate some of …,Reasoning Web International Summer School,2016,*
DataSlicer: Enabling Data Selection For Visual Data Exploration,Laura Sacerdote; Juan Reutter; Christopher G Healey; Pallavi Sumant Deo; Rada Y Chirkova; F Alborzi,Abstract—Determining how to select and transform the data for visualization is one of thehardest problems faced by dataunfamiliar or inexperienced users when performing a visualexploration to solve an analytical task. Our main hypothesis is that for many data sets andcommon analytical tasks; such as finding outliers or general trends in data; there arerelatively few “data slices” that are key to providing effective visualizations for the task. Byfocusing human users on appropriate and suitably transformed parts of the underlying datasets; these data slices can help the users carry their task to correct completion. To verify thishypothesis; we develop a framework that permits us to capture exemplary data slices in anexploration task; and to explore and parse visual-exploration sequences into a format thatmakes them distinct and easy to compare. We develop a recommendation system …,*,2015,*

Static Analysis and Query Answering for Incomplete Data Trees with Constraints,Amélie Gheerbrant; Leonid Libkin; Juan Reutter,Abstract Data trees serve as an abstraction of XML documents: in such trees; every nodecomes with a label from a finite alphabet; as well as a data value from an infinite set.Incomplete data trees model XML documents with incomplete information; they may includeboth structural incompleteness and incompleteness of data. Here we study two basicproblems for incomplete data trees under typical constraints such as keys and foreign keys.The first problem is consistency of specifications of incomplete data trees. We show thatmany of recently established results on consistency of constraints and schema descriptionscan be transferred to the consistency of incomplete tree specifications without any increasein complexity. After that we examine query answering over incomplete data trees underconstraints; and show that tractable bounds can be recovered under key constraints; but …,*,2013,*
Querying APIs with SPARQL: language and worst case optimal algorithms,Matthieu Mosser; Fernando Pieressa; Juan Reutter; Adrián Soto; Domagoj Vrgoc,Abstract. Although the amount of RDF data has been steadily increasing over the years; themajority of information on the Web is still residing in other formats; and is often notaccessible to Semantic Web services. A lot of this data is available through APIs servingJSON documents. In this work we propose a way of extending SPARQL with the option toconsume JSON APIs and integrate the obtained information into SPARQL query answers;thus obtaining a query language allowing to bring data from the “traditional” Web to theSemantic Web. Looking to evaluate these queries as efficiently as possible; we show thatthe main bottleneck is the amount of API requests; and present an algorithm that produces“worst-case optimal” query plans that reduce the number of requests as much as possible.We also do a set of experiments that empirically confirm the optimality of our approach.,*,*,*

SPARQL with Property Paths (version with appendix),Egor V Kostylev; Juan L Reutter; Miguel Romero; Domagoj Vrgoc,Abstract. The original SPARQL proposal was often criticized for its inability to navigatethrough the structure of RDF documents. For this reason property paths were introduced inSPARQL 1.1; but up to date there are no theoretical studies examining how their addition tothe language affects main computational tasks such as query evaluation; query containment;and query subsumption. In this paper we tackle all of these problems and show thatalthough the addition of property paths has no impact on query evaluation; they do make thecontainment and subsumption problems substantially more difficult.,*,*,*
Recursion in SPARQL–online appendix,Juan L Reutter; Adrián Soto; Domagoj Vrgoc,This immediately gives us hardness for all three problems when recursion is allowed. To seethat the upper bound is maintained; note that for each nested query; the temporal graph canhave at most| D| 3 triples. Since we are computing the least fixed point; this means that inevery iteration we add at least one triple; and thus the number of iterations is polynomial.This in turn implies that the answer can be found by composing a polynomial number of NPproblems; to realize the database; followed with a PSPACE problem forSELECTQUERYANSWERING; a Π p 2 problem for SELEC-TQUERYANSWERINGassuming queries given by unions of well designed patterns and NP problems forCONSTRUCTQUERYANSWERING. First two classes are closed under composition with NP;and the last NP bound can be obtained by just guessing all meaningful queries and …,*,*,*
