Collaborative location and activity recommendations with GPS history data,Vincent W Zheng; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Qiang Yang,Abstract With the increasing popularity of location-based services; such as tour guide andlocation-based social network; we now have accumulated many location data on the Web. Inthis paper; we show that; by using the location data based on GPS and users' comments atvarious locations; we can discover interesting locations and possible activities that can beperformed there for recommendations. Our research is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life: 1) if we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing; where should we go? 2) If we have already visitedsome places such as the Bird's Nest building in Beijing's Olympic park; what else can we dothere? By using our system; for the first question; we can recommend her to visit a list ofinteresting locations such as Tiananmen Square; Bird's Nest; etc. For the second question …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,566
Collaborative Filtering Meets Mobile Recommendation: A User-Centered Approach.,Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Bin Cao; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Qiang Yang,Abstract With the increasing popularity of location tracking services such as GPS; more andmore mobile data are being accumulated. Based on such data; a potentially useful service isto make timely and targeted recommendations for users on places where they might beinterested to go and activities that they are likely to conduct. For example; a user arriving inBeijing might wonder where to visit and what she can do around the Forbidden City. A keychallenge for such recommendation problems is that the data we have on each individualuser might be very limited; while to make useful and accurate recommendations; we needextensive annotated location and activity information from user trace data. In this paper; wepresent a new approach; known as user-centered collaborative location and activity filtering(UCLAF); to pull many users' data together and apply collaborative filtering to find like …,Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2010,253
Towards mobile intelligence: Learning from GPS history data for collaborative recommendation,Vincent W Zheng; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Qiang Yang,Abstract With the increasing popularity of location-based services; we have accumulated alot of location data on the Web. In this paper; we are interested in answering two popularlocation-related queries in our daily life:(1) if we want to do something such as sightseeingor dining in a large city like Beijing; where should we go?(2) If we want to visit a place suchas the Birdʼs Nest in Beijing Olympic park; what can we do there? We develop a mobilerecommendation system to answer these queries. In our system; we first model the usersʼlocation and activity histories as a user–location–activity rating tensor. 1 Because each userhas limited data; the resulting rating tensor is essentially very sparse. This makes ourrecommendation task difficult. In order to address this data sparsity problem; we proposethree algorithms 2 based on collaborative filtering. The first algorithm merges all the …,Artificial Intelligence,2012,139
Estimating Location Using Wi-Fi.,Qiang Yang; Sinno Jialin Pan; Vincent Wenchen Zheng,Recent advances in pervasive computing and mobile technology have enabled accuratelocation and activity tracking of users wearing wireless devices indoors; where GPS isn'tavailable. A practical way to do this is by leveraging the Wi-Fi signals that a mobile clientreceives from various access points. For example; many indoor location estimationtechniques use received radio signal strength (RSS) values and radio signal propagationmodels to track users. Machine learning-based methods have proven among the mostaccurate. However; Wi-Fi data is noisy owing to the indoor environment's multipath andshadow fading effects. The data distribution changes constantly as people move and astemperature and humidity change. 1–3 Moreover; it can be expensive to collect and labelRSS training data in a large building because it requires a human to walk with a mobile …,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2008,112

Real world activity recognition with multiple goals,Derek Hao Hu; Sinno Jialin Pan; Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Nathan Nan Liu; Qiang Yang,Abstract Recognizing and understanding the activities of people from sensor readings is animportant task in ubiquitous computing. Activity recognition is also a particularly difficult taskbecause of the inherent uncertainty and complexity of the data collected by the sensors.Many researchers have tackled this problem in an overly simplistic setting by assuming thatusers often carry out single activities one at a time or multiple activities consecutively; oneafter another. However; so far there has been no formal exploration on the degree in whichhumans perform concurrent or interleaving activities; and no thorough study on how todetect multiple goals in a real world scenario. In this article; we ask the fundamentalquestions of whether users often carry out multiple concurrent and interleaving activities orsingle activities in their daily life; and if so; whether such complex behavior can be …,Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Ubiquitous computing,2008,77
Modeling User Activity Preference by Leveraging User Spatial Temporal Characteristics in LBSNs,Dingqi Yang; Daqing Zhang; Vincent W Zheng; Zhiyong Yu,With the recent surge of location based social networks (LBSNs); activity data of millions ofusers has become attainable. This data contains not only spatial and temporal stamps ofuser activity; but also its semantic information. LBSNs can help to understand mobile users'spatial temporal activity preference (STAP); which can enable a wide range of ubiquitousapplications; such as personalized context-aware location recommendation and group-oriented advertisement. However; modeling such user-specific STAP needs to tackle high-dimensional data; ie; user-location-time-activity quadruples; which is complicated andusually suffers from a data sparsity problem. In order to address this problem; we propose aSTAP model. It first models the spatial and temporal activity preference separately; and thenuses a principle way to combine them for preference inference. In order to characterize …,IEEE Transactions on Systems; Man; and Cybernetics: Systems,2014,75
Cross-domain activity recognition,Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Derek Hao Hu; Qiang Yang,Abstract In activity recognition; one major challenge is huge manual effort in labeling when anew domain of activities is to be tested. In this paper; we ask an interesting question: can wetransfer the available labeled data from a set of existing activities in one domain to helprecognize the activities in another different but related domain? Our answer is" yes";provided that the sensor data from the two domains are related in some way. We develop abridge between the activities in two domains by learning a similarity function via Websearch; under the condition that the sensor data are from the same feature space. Based onthe learned similarity measures; our algorithm interprets the data from the source domain asthe data in the domain with different confidence levels; thus accomplishing the cross-domainknowledge transfer task. Our algorithm is evaluated on several real-world datasets to …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Ubiquitous computing,2009,72
Abnormal Activity Recognition Based on HDP-HMM Models,Derek Hao Hu; Xian-Xing Zhang; Jie Yin; Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Qiang Yang,Abstract Detecting abnormal activities from sensor readings is an important researchproblem in activity recognition. A number of different algorithms have been proposed in thepast to tackle this problem. Many of the previous state-based approaches suffer from theproblem of failing to decide the appropriate number of states; which are difficult to findthrough a trial-and-error approach; in real-world applications. In this paper; we propose anaccurate and flexible framework for abnormal activity recognition from sensor readings thatinvolves less human tuning of model parameters. Our approach first applies a HierarchicalDirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM); which supports an infinite number ofstates; to automatically find an appropriate number of states. We incorporate a Fisher Kernelinto the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) model to filter out the activities that …,Proceedings of the 21st international Joint Conference on Artifical intelligence (IJCAI),2009,71
Transfer learning for wifi-based indoor localization,Sinno Jialin Pan; Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Qiang Yang; Derek Hao Hu,*,Proceedings of AAAI 2008 Workshop Transfer Learning for Complex Task,2008,61
Transferring Localization Models over Time.,Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Evan Wei Xiang; Qiang Yang; Dou Shen,Abstract Learning-based localization methods typically consist of an offline phase to collectthe wireless signal data to build a statistical model; and an online phase to apply the modelon new data. Many of these methods treat the training data as if their distributions are fixedacross time. However; due to complex environmental changes such as temperaturechanges and multi-path fading effect; the signals can significantly vary from time to time;causing the localization accuracy to drop. We address this problem by introducing a novelsemi-supervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to transfer the learned model from one timeperiod to another. This adaptive model is referred to as transferred HMM (TrHMM); in whichwe aim to transfer as much knowledge from the old model as possible to reduce thecalibration effort for the current time period. Our contribution is that we can successfully …,Twenty-Third Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI),2008,54
Cross-domain activity recognition via transfer learning,Derek Hao Hu; Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Qiang Yang,Abstract In activity recognition; one major challenge is how to reduce the labeling effort oneneeds to make when recognizing a new set of activities. In this paper; we analyze thepossibility of transferring knowledge from the available labeled data on a set of existingactivities in one domain to help recognize the activities in another different but relateddomain. We found that such a knowledge transfer process is possible; provided that therecognized activities from the two domains are related in some way. We develop a bridgebetween the activities in two domains by learning a similarity function via Web search; underthe condition that the sensor readings are from the same feature space. Based on thelearned similarity measure; our algorithm interprets the data from the source domain as“pseudo training data” in the target domain with different confidence levels; which are in …,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2010,44
Multi-task learning for cross-platform siRNA efficacy prediction: an in-silico study,Qi Liu; Qian Xu; Vincent W Zheng; Hong Xue; Zhiwei Cao; Qiang Yang,Gene silencing using exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is now a widespreadmolecular tool for gene functional study and new-drug target identification. The keymechanism in this technique is to design efficient siRNAs that incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) to bind and interact with the mRNA targets to represstheir translations to proteins. Although considerable progress has been made in thecomputational analysis of siRNA binding efficacy; few joint analysis of different RNAiexperiments conducted under different experimental scenarios has been done in researchso far; while the joint analysis is an important issue in cross-platform siRNA efficacyprediction.

Indoor localization in multi-floor environments with reduced effort,Hua-Yan Wang; Vincent W Zheng; Junhui Zhao; Qiang Yang,In pervasive computing; localizing a user in wireless indoor environments is an important yetchallenging task. Among the state-of-art localization methods; fingerprinting is shown to bequite successful by statistically learning the signal to location relations. However; a majordrawback for fingerprinting is that; it usually requires a lot of labeled data to train an accuratelocalization model. To establish a fingerprinting-based localization model in a building withmany floors; we have to collect sufficient labeled data on each floor. This effort can be veryburdensome. In this paper; we study how to reduce this calibration effort by only collectingthe labeled data on one floor; while collecting unlabeled data on other floors. Our idea isinspired by the observation that; although the wireless signals can be quite different; thefloor-plans in a building are similar. Therefore; if we co-embed these different floors' data …,Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,37
CEPR: A Collaborative Exploration and Periodically Returning Model for Location Prediction,Defu Lian; Xing Xie; Vincent W Zheng; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Fuzheng Zhang; Enhong Chen,Abstract With the growing popularity of location-based social networks; numerous locationvisiting records (eg; check-ins) continue to accumulate over time. The more these recordsare collected; the better we can understand users' mobility patterns and the more accuratelywe can predict their future locations. However; due to the personality trait of neophilia;people also show propensities of novelty seeking in human mobility; that is; exploringunvisited but tailored locations for them to visit. As such; the existing prediction algorithms;mainly relying on regular mobility patterns; face severe challenges because such behavioris beyond the reach of regularity. As a matter of fact; the prediction of this behavior not onlyrelies on the forecast of novelty-seeking tendency but also depends on how to determineunvisited candidate locations. To this end; we put forward a Collaborative Exploration and …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2015,36
Covariate shift in hilbert space: A solution via sorrogate kernels,Kai Zhang; Vincent W. Zheng; Qiaojun Wang; James Kwok; Qiang Yang; Ivan Marsic,Abstract Covariate shift is a unconventional learning scenario in which training and testingdata have different distributions. A general principle to solve the problem is to make thetraining data distribution similar to the test one; such that classifiers computed on the formergeneralizes well to the latter. Current approaches typically target on the sample distributionin the input space; however; for kernel-based learning methods; the algorithm performancedepends directly on the geometry of the kernel-induced feature space. Motivated by this; wepropose to match data distributions in the Hilbert space; which; given a pre-definedempirical kernel map; can be formulated as aligning kernel matrices across domains. Inparticular; to evaluate similarity of kernel matrices defined on arbitrarily different samples;the novel concept of surrogate kernel is introduced based on the Mercer's theorem.

Joint learning user's activities and profiles from GPS data,Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Yu Zheng; Qiang Yang,Abstract As the GPS-enabled mobile devices become extensively available; we are nowgiven a chance to better understand human behaviors from a large amount of the GPStrajectories representing the mobile users' location histories. In this paper; we aim toestablish a framework; which can jointly learn the user activities (what is the user doing) andprofiles (what is the user's background; such as occupation; gender; age; etc.) from the GPSdata. We will show that; learning user activities and learning user profiles can be beneficialto each other in nature; so we try to put them together and formulate a joint learning problemunder a probabilistic collaborative filtering framework. In particular; for activity recognition;we manage to extract the location semantics from the raw GPS data and use it; together withthe user profile; as the input; and we will output the corresponding activities of daily living …,Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks,2009,19
Semantic Proximity Search on Graphs with Metagraph-based Learning,Yuan Fang; Wenqing Lin; Vincent W Zheng; Min Wu; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Xiao-Li Li,Given ubiquitous graph data such as the Web and social networks; proximity search ongraphs has been an active research topic. The task boils down to measuring the proximitybetween two nodes on a graph. Although most earlier studies deal with homogeneous orbipartite graphs only; many real-world graphs are heterogeneous with objects of varioustypes; giving rise to different semantic classes of proximity. For instance; on a social networktwo users can be close for different reasons; such as being classmates or family members;which represent two distinct classes of proximity. Thus; it becomes inadequate to onlymeasure a “generic” form of proximity as previous works have focused on. In this paper; weidentify metagraphs as a novel and effective means to characterize the common structuresfor a desired class of proximity. Subsequently; we propose a family of metagraph-based …,IEEE 32nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),2016,18
Domain-constrained semi-supervised mining of tracking models in sensor networks,Rong Pan; Junhui Zhao; Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Jeffrey Junfeng Pan; Dou Shen; Sinno Jialin Pan; Qiang Yang,Abstract Accurate localization of mobile objects is a major research problem in sensornetworks and an important data mining application. Specifically; the localization problem isto determine the location of a client device accurately given the radio signal strength valuesreceived at the client device from multiple beacon sensors or access points. Conventionaldata mining and machine learning methods can be applied to solve this problem. However;all of them require large amounts of labeled training data; which can be quite expensive. Inthis paper; we propose a probabilistic semi supervised learning approach to reduce thecalibration effort and increase the tracking accuracy. Our method is based on semi-supervised conditional random fields which can enhance the learned model from a small setof training data with abundant unlabeled data effectively.

Collaborative filtering meets next check-in location prediction,Defu Lian; Vincent W Zheng; Xing Xie,Abstract With the increasing popularity of Location-based Social Networks; a vast amount oflocation check-ins have been accumulated. Though location prediction in terms of check-inshas been recently studied; the phenomena that users often check in novel locations has notbeen addressed. To this end; in this paper; we leveraged collaborative filtering techniquesfor check-in location prediction and proposed a short-and long-term preference model. Weextensively evaluated it on two large-scale check-in datasets from Gowalla and Dianpingwith 6M and 1M check-ins; respectively; and showed that the proposed model canoutperform the competing baselines.,Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web (WWW) companion,2013,13
Learning Community Embedding with Community Detection and Node Embedding on Graphs,Sandro Cavallari; Vincent W. Zheng; Hongyun Cai; Kevin C.-C. Chang; Erik Cambria,Abstract In this paper; we study an important yet largely under-explored setting of graphembedding; ie; embedding communities instead of each individual nodes. We find thatcommunity embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graphvisualization; but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. Tolearn such embedding; our insight hinges upon a closed loop among communityembedding; community detection and node embedding. On the one hand; node embeddingcan help improve community detection; which outputs good communities for fitting bettercommunity embedding. On the other hand; community embedding can be used to optimizethe node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by thisinsight; we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three …,Proceedings of The 26th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM),2017,11
From node embedding to community embedding,Vincent W Zheng; Sandro Cavallari; Hongyun Cai; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Erik Cambria,Abstract: Most of the existing graph embedding methods focus on nodes; which aim tooutput a vector representation for each node in the graph such that two nodes being" close"on the graph are close too in the low-dimensional space. Despite the success of embeddingindividual nodes for graph analytics; we notice that an important concept of embeddingcommunities (ie; groups of nodes) is missing. Embedding communities is useful; not only forsupporting various community-level applications; but also to help preserve communitystructure in graph embedding. In fact; we see community embedding as providing a higher-order proximity to define the node closeness; whereas most of the popular graph embeddingmethods focus on first-order and/or second-order proximities. To learn the communityembedding; we hinge upon the insight that community embedding and node embedding …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.09950,2016,11
HIPS: A calibration-less hybrid indoor positioning system using heterogeneous sensors,Vincent W Zheng; Junhui Zhao; Yongcai Wang; Qiang Yang,Positioning is a crucial task in pervasive computing; aimed at estimating the user's positionsto provide location-based services. In this paper; we study an interesting problem: when wewish to obtain hybrid positioning granularities in an office environment; how can weincorporate heterogeneous sensors to build an indoor positioning system with minimalhuman calibration effort? We propose a calibration-less solution by incorporating theultrasound sensors with the radio-frequency sensors. In our solution; we use these twodifferent types of sensors to satisfy the different granularities requirement; and meanwhile;we use the ultrasound sensors to help calibrate the radio-frequency sensors for positioning;so that we can minimize; or even eliminate the labeling effort for the radio-frequencypositioning.

Digital wall: A power-efficient solution for location-based data sharing,Jeffrey Junfeng Pan; Sinno Jialin Pan; Vincent Wenchen Zheng; Qiang Yang,With the proliferation of wireless and sensor techniques; data can be shared convenientlythrough the air. However; wireless communication is vulnerable since unauthorizedmachine may try to intrude a server without being physically connected. In this paper; wewish to control the communication between a wireless client and the infrastructure based onthe client location. Our idea is toimplement a digital wall; which is a user-defined boundaryso that access is allowed within the boundary and denied outside the boundary. To do this;we need to do accurate location estimation since the decision around the boundary line iscritical. Furthermore; computational efficiency is also important since we need to reducecomputation cost so as to save power energy.

Thus; question answering becomes an essential problem in CQAsites; which ranks the high-quality answers to the given question.

User-dependent aspect model for collaborative activity recognition,Vincent W Zheng; Qiang Yang,Abstract Activity recognition aims to discover one or more users' actions and goals based onsensor readings. In the real world; a single user's data are often insufficient for training anactivity recognition model due to the data sparsity problem. This is especially true when weare interested in obtaining a personalized model. In this paper; we study how tocollaboratively use different users' sensor data to train a model that can providepersonalized activity recognition for each user. We propose a user-dependent aspect modelfor this collaborative activity recognition task. Our model introduces user aspect variables tocapture the user grouping information; so that a target user can also benefit from her similarusers in the same group to train the recognition model. In this way; we can greatly reducethe need for much valuable and expensive labeled data required in training the …,International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI),2011,9

Thisalgorithm practically considers the power control problem in the interference-based linkscheduling process; and provides a congestion control on the transport layer.

Integrated QSAR study for inhibitors of hedgehog signal pathway against multiple cell lines: a collaborative filtering method,Jun Gao; Dongsheng Che; Vincent W Zheng; Ruixin Zhu; Qi Liu,The Hedgehog Signaling Pathway is one of signaling pathways that are very important toembryonic development. The participation of inhibitors in the Hedgehog Signal Pathway cancontrol cell growth and death; and searching novel inhibitors to the functioning of thepathway are in a great demand. As the matter of fact; effective inhibitors could provideefficient therapies for a wide range of malignancies; and targeting such pathway in cellsrepresents a promising new paradigm for cell growth and death control. Current researchmainly focuses on the syntheses of the inhibitors of cyclopamine derivatives; which bindspecifically to the Smo protein; and can be used for cancer therapy.

Semantic Proximity Search on Heterogeneous Graph by Proximity Embedding,Zemin Liu; Vincent W Zheng; Zhou Zhao; Fanwei Zhu; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Minghui Wu; Jing Ying,Abstract Many real-world networks have a rich collection of objects. The semantics of theseobjects allows us to capture different classes of proximities; thus enabling an important taskof semantic proximity search. As the core of semantic proximity search; we have to measurethe proximity on a heterogeneous graph; whose nodes are various types of objects. Most ofthe existing methods rely on engineering features about the graph structure between twonodes to measure their proximity. With recent development on graph embedding; we see agood chance to avoid feature engineering for semantic proximity search. There is very littlework on using graph embedding for semantic proximity search. We also observe that graphembedding methods typically focus on embedding nodes; which is an “indirect” approach tolearn the proximity. Thus; we introduce a new concept of proximity embedding; which …,The Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI),2017,6
An Aggressive Graph-based Selective Sampling Algorithm for Classification,Peng Yang; Peilin Zhao; Vincent W. Zheng; Xiao-Li Li,Traditional online learning algorithms are designed for vector data only; which assume thatthe labels of all the training examples are provided. In this paper; we study graphclassification where only limited nodes are chosen for labelling by selective sampling.Particularly; we first adapt a spectral-based graph regularization technique to derive a novelonline learning linear algorithm which can handle graph data; although it still queries thelabels of all nodes and thus is not preferred; as labelling is typically time-consuming. Toaddress this issue; we then propose a new confidence-based query method for selectivesampling. The theoretical result shows that our online learning algorithm with a fraction ofqueried labels can achieve a mistake bound comparable with the one learning on all labelsof the nodes. In addition; the algorithm based on our proposed query strategy can …,IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),2015,6

A comprehensive survey of graph embedding: Problems; techniques and applications,Hongyun Cai; Vincent W Zheng; Kevin Chang,Graph is an important data representation which appears in a wide diversity of real-worldscenarios. Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what isbehind the data; and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification;node recommendation; link prediction; etc. However; most graph analytics methods sufferthe high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way tosolve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space inwhich the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. Inthis survey; we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. Wefirst introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts.

Cold-Start Heterogeneous-Device Wireless Localization,Vincent W Zheng; Hong Cao; Shenghua Gao; Aditi Adhikari; Miao Lin; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract In this paper; we study a cold-start heterogeneous-device localization problem. Thisproblem is challenging; because it results in an extreme inductive transfer learning setting;where there is only source domain data but no target domain data. This problem is alsounderexplored. As there is no target domain data for calibration; we aim to learn a robustfeature representation only from the source domain. There is little previous work on such arobust feature learning task; besides; the existing robust feature representation proposalsare both heuristic and inexpressive. As our contribution; we for the first time provide aprincipled and expressive robust feature representation to solve the challenging cold-startheterogeneous-device localization problem. We evaluate our model on two public real-world data sets; and show that it significantly outperforms the best baseline by 23.1 …,AAAI,2016,5
Mobile user verification/identification using statistical mobility profile,Miao Lin; Hong Cao; Vincent W. Zheng; Kevin C.-C. Chang; Shonali Krishnaswamy,Recent studies show that ubiquitous smartphone data; eg; the universal cell tower IDs; WiFiaccess points; etc.; can be used to effectively recover individuals' mobility. However;recording and releasing the data containing such information without anonymization canhurt individuals' location privacy. Therefore; many anonymization methods have been usedto sanitize these datasets before they are shared to the research community. In this paper;we demonstrate the idea of statistical mobile user profiling and identification based onanonymized datasets.

Next Place Prediction by Learning with Multiple Models,Zhongqi Lu; Yin Zhu; Vincent W Zheng; Qiang Yang,ABSTRACT Location prediction has been an active research area for a long time. The Task2 of Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC)[6] provides plenty of data collected using mobilephone and the transitions from one place to another. Given a user currently at one place andthe context associated with this visit; we are interested in the relationship between thecurrent context and the next visit and the prediction of the next place the user is going to. Wefocused on using the transitions between places for each individual user; as well as the timecontext; to do prediction. We also tried to explore other context information such as call-logsand accelerometer data in the current place. By combining the location transition informationand the context information; we provide an ensemble learning approach to pick theappropriate model for each user.

These data are beingaccumulated at an extremely fast rate. As a result; knowledge discovery from these data forrecognizing activities has become an important problem. The discovered activity patternscan help us understand people's lives; analyze traffic in a large city and study socialnetworks among people. Trajectory-based activity recognition builds upon somefundamental functions of location estimation and machine learning; and can provide newinsights on how to infer high-level goals and objectives from low-level sensor readings.

From community detection to community profiling,Hongyun Cai; Vincent W Zheng; Fanwei Zhu; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Zi Huang,Abstract Most existing community-related studies focus on detection; which aim to find thecommunity membership for each user from user friendship links. However; membershipalone; without a complete profile of what a community is and how it interacts with othercommunities; has limited applications. This motivates us to consider systematically profilingthe communities and thereby developing useful community-level applications. In this paper;we for the first time formalize the concept of community profiling. With rich user informationon the network; such as user published content and user diffusion links; we characterize acommunity in terms of both its internal content profile and external diffusion profile. Thedifficulty of community profiling is often underestimated.

Despite the success of recent deeplearning methods for diffusion; we find that they often underexplore the cascade structure.We consider a cascade as not merely a sequence of nodes ordered by their activation timestamps; instead; it has a richer structure indicating the diffusion process over the data graph.As a result; we introduce a new data model; namely diffusion topologies; to fully describe thecascade structure. We find it challenging to model diffusion topologies; which are dynamicdirected acyclic graphs (DAGs); with the existing neural networks. Therefore; we propose anovel topological recurrent neural network; namely Topo-LSTM; for modeling dynamic …,Proceedings of The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),2017,2
Detecting signals of detrimental prescribing cascades from social media,Tao Hoang; Jixue Liu; Nicole Pratt; Vincent W Zheng; Kevin C Chang; Elizabeth Roughead; Jiuyong Li,Abstract Motivation Prescribing cascade (PC) occurs when an adverse drug reaction (ADR)is misinterpreted as a new medical condition; leading to further prescriptions for treatment.Additional prescriptions; however; may worsen the existing condition or introduce additionaladverse effects (AEs). Timely detection and prevention of detrimental PCs is essential asdrug AEs are among the leading causes of hospitalization and deaths. Identifyingdetrimental PCs would enable warnings and contraindications to be disseminated andassist the detection of unknown drug AEs. Nonetheless; the detection is difficult and hasbeen limited to case reports or case assessment using administrative health claims data.Social media is a promising source for detecting signals of detrimental PCs due to the publicavailability of many discussions regarding treatments and drug AEs.

Learning to Query: Focused Web Page Harvesting for Entity Aspects,Yuan Fang; Vincent W Zheng; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,As the Web hosts rich information about real-world entities; our information quests becomeincreasingly entity centric. In this paper; we study the problem of focused harvesting of Webpages for entity aspects; to support downstream applications such as business analytics andbuilding a vertical portal. Given that search engines are the de facto gateways to assessinformation on the Web; we recognize the essence of our problem as Learning to Query(L2Q)-to intelligently select queries so that we can harvest pages; via a search engine;focused on an entity aspect of interest. Thus; it is crucial to quantify the utilities of thecandidate queries wrt some entity aspect. In order to better estimate the utilities; we identifytwo opportunities and address their challenges. First; a target entity in a given domain hasmany peers. We leverage these peer entities to become domain aware. Second; a …,IEEE 32nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),2016,2
Distance-aware dag embedding for proximity search on heterogeneous graphs,Zemin Liu; Vincent W Zheng; Zhou Zhao; Fanwei Zhu; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Minghui Wu; Jing Ying,Abstract Proximity search on heterogeneous graphs aims to measure the proximity betweentwo nodes on a graph wrt some semantic relation for ranking. Pioneer work often tries tomeasure such proximity by paths connecting the two nodes. However; paths as linearsequences have limited expressiveness for the complex network connections. In this paper;we explore a more expressive DAG (directed acyclic graph) data structure for modeling theconnections between two nodes. Particularly; we are interested in learning a representationfor the DAGs to encode the proximity between two nodes. We face two challenges to useDAGs; including how to efficiently generate DAGs and how to effectively learn DAGembedding for proximity search. We find distance-awareness as important for proximitysearch and the key to solve the above challenges. Thus we develop a novel Distance …,*,2018,1
Sociallens: Searching and browsing communities by content and interaction,Hongyun Cai; Vincent W Zheng; Penghe Chen; Fanwei Zhu; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Zi Huang,Community analysis is an important task in graph mining. Most of the existing communitystudies are community detection; which aim to find the community membership for each userbased on the user friendship links. However; membership alone; without a complete profileof what a community is and how it interacts with other communities; has limited applications.This motivates us to consider systematically profiling the communities and therebydeveloping useful community-level applications. In this paper; we introduce a novel conceptof community profiling; upon which we build a SocialLens system1 to enable searching andbrowsing communities by content and interaction. We deploy SocialLens on two socialgraphs: Twitter and DBLP. We demonstrate two useful applications of SocialLens; includinginteractive community visualization and profile-aware community ranking.,IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),2017,1
Link Prediction via Ranking Metric Dual-Level Attention Network Learning,Zhou Zhao; Ben Gao; Vincent W. Zheng; Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Link prediction is a challenging problem for complex network analysis; arising inmany disciplines such as social networks and telecommunication networks. Currently; manyexisting approaches estimate the proximity of the link endpoints from the local neighborhoodaround them for link prediction; which suffer from the localized view of network connections.In this paper; we consider the problem of link prediction from the viewpoint of learning path-based proximity ranking metric embedding. We propose a novel proximity ranking metricattention network learning framework by jointly exploiting both node-level and path-levelattention proximity of the endpoints to their betweenness paths for learning thediscriminative feature representation for link prediction. We then develop the path-baseddual-level attentional learning method with multi-step reasoning process for proximity …,Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI),2017,1
Regularizing structured classifier with conditional probabilistic constraints for semi-supervised learning,Vincent W Zheng; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract Constraints have been shown as an effective way to incorporate unlabeled data forsemi-supervised structured classification. We recognize that; constraints are oftenconditional and probabilistic; moreover; a constraint can have its condition depend on eitherjust observations (which we call x-type constraint) or even hidden variables (which we call y-type constraint). We wish to design a constraint formulation that can flexibly model theconstraint probability for both x-type and y-type constraints; and later use it to regularizegeneral structured classifiers for semi-supervision. Surprisingly; none of the existing modelshave such a constraint formulation. Thus in this paper; we propose a new conditionalprobabilistic formulation for modeling both x-type and y-type constraints. We also recognizethe inference complication for y-type constraint; and propose a systematic selective …,The 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM),2016,1
CityTransfer: Transferring Inter- and Intra-City Knowledge for Chain Store Site Recommendation based on Multi-Source Urban Data,Bin Guo; Jing Li; Vincent W. Zheng; Zhu Wang; Zhiwen Yu,Abstract Chain businesses have been dominating the market in many parts of the world. It isimportant to identify the optimal locations for a new chain store. Recently; numerous studieshave been done on chain store location recommendation. These studies typically learn amodel based on the features of existing chain stores in the city and then predict what othersites are suitable for running a new one. However; these models do not work when a chainenterprise wants to open business in a new city where there is not enough data about thischain store. To solve the cold-start problem; we propose CityTransfer; which transfers chainstore knowledge from semantically-relevant domains (eg; other cities with rich knowledge;similar chain enterprises in the target city) for chain store placement recommendation in anew city. In particular; CityTransfer is a two-fold knowledge transfer framework based on …,Proceedings of The 2018 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp),2018,*
Enhancing Anomaly Diagnosis of Automatic Train Supervision System Based on Operation Log,Yan Li; Binbin Chen; Vincent W Zheng; William G Temple; Zbigniew Kalbarczyk; Yue Wu,Automatic train supervision (ATS) systems are designed to improve the reliability of trainservices. An ATS system coordinates the trains and other systems in a metro and recordsalarms if faults occur. In this work; we propose a context-aware anomaly diagnosis tool toanalyze the underlying causes of alarms for ATS system. Using 61-day data collected froman operational ATS system; we apply our diagnosis tool to conduct systematic analysis ofthe alarms and identify interesting correlations among different assets and events. Ouranalysis shows that the alarms can be correlated with certain system events if they are in thesame operations or the assets associated with them belong to the same or linked systems.These results can improve the efficiency of anomaly diagnosis and maintenance for metrosystem.,Dependable Systems and Networks Workshop (DSN-W); 2017 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on,2017,*
Active Learning for Graph Embedding,Hongyun Cai; Vincent W Zheng; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract: Graph embedding provides an efficient solution for graph analysis by convertingthe graph into a low-dimensional space which preserves the structure information. Incontrast to the graph structure data; the iid node embedding can be processed efficiently interms of both time and space. Current semi-supervised graph embedding algorithmsassume the labelled nodes are given; which may not be always true in the real world. Whilemanually label all training data is inapplicable; how to select the subset of training data tolabel so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is of great importance. Thismotivates our proposed active graph embedding (AGE) framework; in which we design ageneral active learning query strategy for any semi-supervised graph embedding algorithm.AGE selects the most informative nodes as the training labelled nodes based on the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.05085,2017,*
A Simple Regularization-based Algorithm for Learning Cross-Domain Word Embeddings,Wei Yang; Wei Lu; Vincent Zheng,Abstract Learning word embeddings has received a significant amount of attention recently.Often; word embeddings are learned in an unsupervised manner from a large collection oftext.

Learning Word Vectors in Deep Walk using Convolution,Iti Chaturvedi; Sandro Cavallari; Erik Cambria; Vincent W. Zheng,Abstract Textual queries in networks such as Twitter can have more than one label; resultingin a multi-label classification problem. To reduce computational costs; a low-dimensionalrepresentation of a large network is learned that preserves proximity among nodes in thesame community. Similar to sequences of words in a sentence; DeepWalk considerssequences of nodes in a shallow graph and clustering is done using hierarchical softmax inan unsupervised manner. In this paper; we generate network abstractions at different levelsusing deep convolutional neural networks. Since class labels of connected nodes in anetwork keep changing; we consider a fuzzy recurrent feedback controller to ensurerobustness to noise.,The 30th International FLAIRS Conference (AAAI FLAIRS),2017,*
