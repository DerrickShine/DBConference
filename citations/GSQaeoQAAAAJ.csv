RDFS Reasoning and Query Answering on Top of DHTs,Zoi Kaoudi; Iris Miliaraki; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the problem of distributed RDFS reasoning and query answering on top ofdistributed hash tables. Scalable; distributed RDFS reasoning is an essential functionality forproviding the scalability and performance that large-scale Semantic Web applicationsrequire. Our goal in this paper is to compare and evaluate two well-known approaches toRDFS reasoning; namely backward and forward chaining; on top of distributed hash tables.We show how to implement both algorithms on top of the distributed hash table Bamboo andprove their correctness. We also study the time-space trade-off exhibited by the algorithmsanalytically; and experimentally by evaluating our algorithms on PlanetLab.,Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on The Semantic Web,2008,93
RDF in the clouds: a survey,Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract The Resource Description Framework (RDF) pioneered by the W3C is increasinglybeing adopted to model data in a variety of scenarios; in particular data to be published orexchanged on the Web. Managing large volumes of RDF data is challenging; due to thesheer size; the heterogeneity; and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. Totackle the size challenge; distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing isan emerging paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability; fault-tolerance; and elasticity feature it provides; enabling the easy deployment of distributed andparallel architectures. In this article; we survey RDF data management architectures andsystems designed for a cloud environment; and more generally; those large-scale RDF datamanagement systems that can be easily deployed therein.

SPARQL query optimization on top of DHTs,Zoi Kaoudi; Kostis Kyzirakos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the problem of SPARQL query optimization on top of distributed hashtables. Existing works on SPARQL query processing in such environments have never beenimplemented in a real system; or do not utilize any optimization techniques and thus exhibitpoor performance. Our goal in this paper is to propose efficient and scalable algorithms foroptimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries. We augment a known distributed queryprocessing algorithm with query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms ofquery response time and bandwidth usage. We implement our techniques in the systemAtlas and study their performance experimentally in a local cluster.,International Semantic Web Conference,2010,49
Atlas: Storing; updating and querying RDF (S) data on top of DHTs,Zoi Kaoudi; Manolis Koubarakis; Kostis Kyzirakos; Iris Miliaraki; Matoula Magiridou; Antonios Papadakis-Pesaresi,Abstract The RDF (S) data model has been proposed for encoding metadata about Webresources. As more and more Web resources are annotated using RDF (S); there is anurgent need for efficiently dealing with this large volume of data. In this paper; we presentAtlas; a peer-to-peer system for storing; updating and querying RDF (S) data. The Atlassystem has been built using the distributed hash table Bamboo. Atlas was developed in thecontext of project OntoGrid; where it was used as a distributed repository for RDF (S)metadata describing Grid services and resources. The development of Atlas continues inother projects that our group participates currently.

RDF data management in the Amazon cloud,Francesca Bugiotti; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Cloud computing has been massively adopted recently in many applications for itselastic scaling and fault-tolerance. At the same time; given that the amount of available RDFdata sources on the Web increases rapidly; there is a constant need for scalable RDF datamanagement tools. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for the distributedmanagement of RDF data; exploiting an existing commercial cloud infrastructure; namelyAmazon Web Services (AWS). We study the problem of indexing RDF data stored withinAWS; by using SimpleDB; a key-value store provided by AWS for small data items. The goalof the index is to efficiently identify the RDF datasets which may have answers for a givenquery; and route the query only to those. We devised and experimented with severalindexing strategies; we discuss experimental results and avenues for future work.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2012,38

Xml data dissemination using automata on top of structured overlay networks,Iris Miliaraki; Zoi Kaoudi; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We present a novel approach for filtering XML documents using nondeterministicfinite automata and distributed hash tables. Our approach differs architecturally from recentproposals that deal with distributed XML filtering; they assume an XML broker architecture;whereas our solution is built on top of distributed hash tables. The essence of our work is adistributed implementation of YFilter; a state-of-the-art automata-based XML filtering systemon top of Chord. We experimentally evaluate our approach and demonstrate that ouralgorithms can scale to millions of XPath queries under various filtering scenarios; and alsoexhibit very good load balancing properties.,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,19

Distributed RDFS reasoning is essential for providing the functionality thatSemantic Web and Linked Data applications require. Our goal is to present variousinference techniques for RDFS reasoning in a distributed environment; and analyze themboth theoretically and experimentally. The reasoning methods we present are based onbottom-up and top-down techniques and have been implemented on top of the distributedhash table Bamboo.

Rdfsculpt: Managing rdf schemas under set-like semantics,Zoi Kaoudi; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is givenwell-defined meaning to support effective data discovery and integration. The RDFframework is a key issue for the Semantic Web. It can be used in resource discovery toprovide better search engine capabilities; in cataloging for describing the content of thematichierarchies in thematic catalogs and digital libraries; in knowledge sharing and exchange ofWeb agents; etc. Up to now; RDF schemas have been treated rather as sets of individualelements (ie model primitives like classes; properties; etc.). Under that view; queries like“find the part of a portal catalog which is not present in another catalog” can be answeredonly in a procedural way; specifying which nodes to select and how to get them. For thisreason; we argue that answering such queries requires treating schemas as a whole …,European Semantic Web Conference,2005,9
Storing and querying RDF data in Atlas,Zoi Kaoudi; Iris Miliaraki; Matoula Magiridou; Antonios Papadakis-Pesaresi; Manolis Koubarakis; Ilissia Panepistimioupolis,In recent years; more and more resources are semantically annotated; thus generating hugeamounts of RDF metadata. Current centralized RDF repositories lack the required scalabilityand fault tolerance to deal with this emerging situation. Therefore; the need for a scalablesystem that will be able to scale to millions of RDF triples is becoming prevalent. Distributedhash tables (DHTs) is a recent P2P technology that has been proposed for the scalable andfaulttolerant storage and querying of RDF data [2; 1]. Since annotation is by itself adistributed process it ties very well with the model of work imposed by P2P systems. In thisdemo paper; we present Atlas; a P2P system for the distributed storage and retrieval of RDFdata.

RDfind: scalable conditional inclusion dependency discovery in RDF datasets,Sebastian Kruse; Anja Jentzsch; Thorsten Papenbrock; Zoi Kaoudi; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Felix Naumann,Abstract Inclusion dependencies (INDs) form an important integrity constraint on relationaldatabases; supporting data management tasks; such as join path discovery and queryoptimization. Conditional inclusion dependencies (CINDs); which define including andincluded data in terms of conditions; allow to transfer these capabilities to RDF data.However; CIND discovery is computationally much more complex than IND discovery andthe number of CINDs even on small RDF datasets is intractable. To cope with bothproblems; we first introduce the notion of pertinent CINDs with an adjustable relevancecriterion to filter and rank CINDs based on their extent and implications among each other.Second; we present RDFind; a distributed system to efficiently discover all pertinent CINDsin RDF data. RDFind employs a lazy pruning strategy to drastically reduce the CIND …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,5
CliqueSquare in action: Flat plans for massively parallel RDF queries,Benjamin Djahandideh; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Stamatis Zampetakis,RDF is an increasingly popular data model for many practical applications; leading to largevolumes of RDF data; efficient RDF data management methods are crucial to allowapplications to scale. We propose to demonstrate CliqueSquare; an RDF data managementsystem built on top of a MapReduce-like infrastructure. The main technical novelty ofCliqueSquare resides in its logical query optimization algorithm; guaranteed to find a logicalplan as flat as possible for a given query; meaning: a plan having the smallest possiblenumber of join operators on top of each other. CliqueSquare's ability to build flat plansallows it to take advantage of a parallel processing framework in order to shorten responsetimes. We demonstrate loading and querying the data; with a particular focus on queryoptimization; and on the performance benefits of CliqueSquare's flat plans.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5

A Cost-based Optimizer for Gradient Descent Optimization,Zoi Kaoudi; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sanjay Chawla; Divy Agrawal,Abstract As the use of machine learning (ML) permeates into diverse application domains;there is an urgent need to support a declarative framework for ML. Ideally; a user will specifyan ML task in a high-level and easy-to-use language and the framework will invoke theappropriate algorithms and system configurations to execute it. An important observationtowards designing such a framework is that many ML tasks can be expressed asmathematical optimization problems; which take a specific form. Furthermore; theseoptimization problems can be efficiently solved using variations of the gradient descent (GD)algorithm. Thus; to decouple a user specification of an ML task from its execution; a keycomponent is a GD optimizer. We propose a cost-based GD optimizer that selects the bestGD plan for a given ML task.
