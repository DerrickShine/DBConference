Predicting Students Drop Out: A Case Study.,Gerben W Dekker; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Jan M Vleeshouwers,Abstract. The monitoring and support of university freshmen is considered very important atmany educational institutions. In this paper we describe the results of the educational datamining case study aimed at predicting the Electrical Engineering (EE) students drop out afterthe first semester of their studies or even before they enter the study program as well asidentifying success-factors specific to the EE program. Our experimental results show thatrather simple and intuitive classifiers (decision trees) give a useful result with accuraciesbetween 75 and 80%. Besides; we demonstrate the usefulness of cost-sensitive learningand thorough analysis of misclassifications; and show a few ways of further predictionimprovement without having to collect additional data about the students.,International Working Group on Educational Data Mining,2009,279
Diversity in search strategies for ensemble feature selection,Alexey Tsymbal; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Pádraig Cunningham,Abstract Ensembles of learnt models constitute one of the main current directions in machinelearning and data mining. Ensembles allow us to achieve higher accuracy; which is often notachievable with single models. It was shown theoretically and experimentally that in orderfor an ensemble to be effective; it should consist of base classifiers that have diversity in theirpredictions. One technique; which proved to be effective for constructing an ensemble ofdiverse base classifiers; is the use of different feature subsets; or so-called ensemble featureselection. Many ensemble feature selection strategies incorporate diversity as an objectivein the search for the best collection of feature subsets. A number of ways are known toquantify diversity in ensembles of classifiers; and little research has been done about theirappropriateness to ensemble feature selection. In this paper; we compare five measures …,Information fusion,2005,270

AH 12 years later: a comprehensive survey of adaptive hypermedia methods and techniques,Evgeny Knutov; Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy,A hypermedia application offers its users much freedom to navigate through a largehyperspace. Adaptive hypermedia (AH) offers personalized content; presentation; andnavigation support. Many adaptive hypermedia systems (AHS) are tightly integrated withone specific application and/or use a limited number of techniques and methods. Thismakes it difficult to capture all of them in one generic model. In this paper we examineadaptation questions stated in the very beginning of the AH era and elaborate on theirrecent interpretations.

Dynamic integration of classifiers for handling concept drift,Alexey Tsymbal; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Pádraig Cunningham; Seppo Puuronen,Abstract In the real world concepts are often not stable but change with time. A typicalexample of this in the biomedical context is antibiotic resistance; where pathogen sensitivitymay change over time as new pathogen strains develop resistance to antibiotics that werepreviously effective. This problem; known as concept drift; complicates the task of learning amodel from data and requires special approaches; different from commonly used techniquesthat treat arriving instances as equally important contributors to the final concept. Theunderlying data distribution may change as well; making previously built models useless.This is known as virtual concept drift. Both types of concept drifts make regular updates ofthe model necessary. Among the most popular and effective approaches to handle conceptdrift is ensemble learning; where a set of models built over different time periods is …,Information fusion,2008,198
Handling concept drift in process mining,RP Jagadeesh Chandra Bose; Wil MP van der Aalst; Indrė Žliobaitė; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Operational processes need to change to adapt to changing circumstances; eg;new legislation; extreme variations in supply and demand; seasonal effects; etc. While thetopic of flexibility is well-researched in the BPM domain; contemporary process miningapproaches assume the process to be in steady state. When discovering a process modelfrom event logs; it is assumed that the process at the beginning of the recorded period is thesame as the process at the end of the recorded period. Obviously; this is often not the casedue to the phenomenon known as concept drift. While cases are being handled; the processitself may be changing. This paper presents an approach to analyze such second-orderdynamics. The approach has been implemented in ProM and evaluated by analyzing anevolving process.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2011,131
Discrimination aware decision tree learning,Faisal Kamiran; Toon Calders; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Recently; the following discrimination aware classification problem was introduced: given alabeled dataset and an attribute B; find a classifier with high predictive accuracy that at thesame time does not discriminate on the basis of the given attribute B. This problem ismotivated by the fact that often available historic data is biased due to discrimination; eg;when B denotes ethnicity. Using the standard learners on this data may lead to wrongfullybiased classifiers; even if the attribute B is removed from training data. Existing solutions forthis problem consist in “cleaning away” the discrimination from the dataset before a classifieris learned. In this paper we study an alternative approach in which the non-discriminationconstraint is pushed deeply into a decision tree learner by changing its splitting criterion andpruning strategy. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach advances …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,113
What's your current stress level? Detection of stress patterns from GSR sensor data,Jorn Bakker; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Natalia Sidorova,The problem of job stress is generally recognized as one of the major factors leading to aspectrum of health problems. People with certain professions; like intensive care specialistsor call-center operators; and people in certain phases of their lives; like working parents withyoung children; are at increased risk of getting overstressed. Stress management shouldstart far before the stress start causing illnesses. The current state of sensor technologyallows to develop systems measuring physical symptoms reflecting the stress level. In thispaper we (1) formulate the problem of stress identification and categorization from thesensor data stream mining perspective;(2) consider a reductionist approach for arousalidentification as a drift detection task;(3) highlight the major problems of dealing with GSRdata; collected from a watch-style stress measurement device in normal (ie in non-lab) …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,105

Dealing with concept drifts in process mining,RP Jagadeesh Chandra Bose; Wil MP Van Der Aalst; Indre Zliobaite; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Although most business processes change over time; contemporary process miningtechniques tend to analyze these processes as if they are in a steady state. Processes maychange suddenly or gradually. The drift may be periodic (eg; because of seasonalinfluences) or one-of-a-kind (eg; the effects of new legislation). For the processmanagement; it is crucial to discover and understand such concept drifts in processes. Thispaper presents a generic framework and specific techniques to detect when a processchanges and to localize the parts of the process that have changed. Different features areproposed to characterize relationships among activities. These features are used to discoverdifferences between successive populations.

Dynamic integration with random forests,Alexey Tsymbal; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Pádraig Cunningham,Abstract Random Forests (RF) are a successful ensemble prediction technique that usesmajority voting or averaging as a combination function. However; it is clear that each tree ina random forest may have a different contribution in processing a certain instance. In thispaper; we demonstrate that the prediction performance of RF may still be improved in somedomains by replacing the combination function with dynamic integration; which is based onlocal performance estimates. Our experiments also demonstrate that the RF IntrinsicSimilarity is better than the commonly used Heterogeneous Euclidean/Overlap Metric infinding a neighbourhood for local estimates in the context of dynamic integration ofclassification random forests.,European conference on machine learning,2006,56

Using minimum description length for process mining,Toon Calders; Christian W Günther; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Anne Rozinat,Abstract In the field of process mining; the goal is to automatically extract process modelsfrom event logs. Recently; many algorithms have been proposed for this task. For comparingthese models; different quality measures have been proposed. Most of these measures;however; have several disadvantages; they are model-dependent; assume that the modelthat generated the log is known; or need negative examples of event sequences. In thispaper we propose a new measure; based on the minimal description length principle; toevaluate the quality of process models that does not have these disadvantages. To illustratethe properties of the new measure we conduct experiments and discuss the trade-offbetween model complexity and compression.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,2009,55
Process Mining Online Assessment Data.,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Nikola Trcka; Ekaterina Vasilyeva; Wil van der Aalst; Paul De Bra,Abstract. Traditional data mining techniques have been extensively applied to findinteresting patterns; build descriptive and predictive models from large volumes of dataaccumulated through the use of different information systems. The results of data mining canbe used for getting a better understanding of the underlying educational processes; forgenerating recommendations and advice to students; for improving management of learningobjects; etc. However; most of the traditional data mining techniques focus on datadependencies or simple patterns and do not provide a visual representation of the completeeducational (assessment) process ready to be analyzed. To allow for these types of analysis(in which the process plays the central role); a new line of data-mining research; calledprocess mining; has been initiated.

Class noise and supervised learning in medical domains: The effect of feature extraction,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal; Seppo Puuronen; Oleksandr Pechenizkiy,Inductive learning systems have been successfully applied in a number of medical domains.It is generally accepted that the highest accuracy results that an inductive learning systemcan achieve depend on the quality of data and on the appropriate selection of a learningalgorithm for the data. In this paper we analyze the effect of class noise on supervisedlearning in medical domains. We review the related work on learning from noisy data andpropose to use feature extraction as a pre-processing step to diminish the effect of classnoise on the learning process. Our experiments with 8 medical datasets show that featureextraction indeed helps to deal with class noise. It clearly results in higher classificationaccuracy of learnt models without the separate explicit elimination of noisy instances,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2006.

Defining adaptation in a generic multi layer model: CAM: The GRAPPLE Conceptual Adaptation Model,Maurice Hendrix; Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy; David Smits; Alexandra Cristea,Abstract Authoring of Adaptive Hypermedia is a difficult and time consuming task. Referencemodels like LAOS and AHAM separate adaptation and content in different layers. Systemslike AHA!; offer graphical tools based on these models to allow authors to define adaptationwithout knowing any adaptation language. The adaptation that can be defined using suchtools is still limited. Authoring systems like MOT are more flexible; but usability of adaptationspecification is low. This paper proposes a more generic model; CAM; which allows theadaptation to be defined in an arbitrary number of layers; where adaptation is expressed interms of relationships between concepts. This model allows the creation of more powerfulyet easier to use graphical authoring tools.,European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning,2008,40
An overview of concept drift applications,Indrė Žliobaitė; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Joao Gama,Abstract In most challenging data analysis applications; data evolve over time and must beanalyzed in near real time. Patterns and relations in such data often evolve over time; thus;models built for analyzing such data quickly become obsolete over time. In machine learningand data mining this phenomenon is referred to as concept drift. The objective is to deploymodels that would diagnose themselves and adapt to changing data over time. This chapterprovides an application oriented view towards concept drift research; with a focus onsupervised learning tasks. First we overview and categorize application tasks for which theproblem of concept drift is particularly relevant. Then we construct a reference framework forpositioning application tasks within a spectrum of problems related to concept drift. Finally;we discuss some promising research directions from the application perspective; and …,*,2016,39
Sequential Genetic Search for Ensemble Feature Selection,Alexey Tsymbal; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Pádraig Cunningham,Abstract Ensemble learning constitutes one of the main directions in machine learning anddata mining. Ensembles allow us to achieve higher accuracy; which is often not achievablewith single models. One technique; which proved to be effective for constructing anensemble of diverse classifiers; is the use of feature subsets. Among different approaches toensemble feature selection; genetic search was shown to perform best in many domains. Inthis paper; a new strategy GAS-SEFS; Genetic Algorithm-based Sequential Search forEnsemble Feature Selection; is introduced. Instead of one genetic process; it employs aseries of processes; the goal of each of which is to build one base classifier.

A comparative study of dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance trace clustering performances,Minseok Song; H Yang; Seyed Hossein Siadat; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Process mining techniques have been used to analyze event logs from informationsystems in order to derive useful patterns. However; in the big data era; real-life event logsare huge; unstructured; and complex so that traditional process mining techniques havedifficulties in the analysis of big logs. To reduce the complexity during the analysis; traceclustering can be used to group similar traces together and to mine more structured andsimpler process models for each of the clusters locally. However; a high dimensionality ofthe feature space in which all the traces are presented poses different problems to traceclustering. In this paper; we study the effect of applying dimensionality reduction(preprocessing) techniques on the performance of trace clustering. In our experimental studywe use three popular feature transformation techniques; singular value decomposition …,Expert Systems with Applications,2013,35
Building classifiers with independency constraints,Toon Calders; Faisal Kamiran; Mykola Pechenizkiy,In this paper we study the problem of classifier learning where the input data containsunjustified dependencies between some data attributes and the class label. Such casesarise for example when the training data is collected from different sources with differentlabeling criteria or when the data is generated by a biased decision process. When aclassifier is trained directly on such data; these undesirable dependencies will carry over tothe classifier's predictions. In order to tackle this problem; we study the classification withindependency constraints problem: find an accurate model for which the predictions areindependent from a given binary attribute. We propose two solutions for this problem andpresent an empirical validation.,Data mining workshops; 2009. ICDMW'09. IEEE international conference on,2009,35

In this paper we describe an educational data mining (EDM) case study based onthe data collected during the online assessment of students who were able to immediatelyreceive tailored and elaborated feedback (EF) after answering each of the questions in thetest. Our main interest as domain experts (ie educators) is in studying (by employing anykind of analysis) how well the questions in the test and the corresponding EF were designedor tailored towards the individual needs of the students.

From local patterns to global models: Towards domain driven educational process mining,Nikola Trcka; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Educational process mining (EPM) aims at (i) constructing complete and compacteducational process models that are able to reproduce all observed behavior (processmodel discovery);(ii) checking whether the modeled behavior (either pre-authored ordiscovered from data) matches the observed behavior (conformance checking); and (iii)projecting information extracted from the logs onto the model; to make the tacit knowledgeexplicit and facilitate better understanding of the process (process model extension). In thispaper we propose a new domain-driven framework for EPM which assumes that a set ofpattern templates can be predefined to focus the mining in a desired way and make it moreeffective and efficient.

Online mass flow prediction in CFB boilers with explicit detection of sudden concept drift,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Jorn Bakker; I Žliobaitė; Andriy Ivannikov; Tommi Kärkkäinen,Abstract Fuel feeding and inhomogeneity of fuel typically cause fluctuations in the circulatingfluidized bed (CFB) process. If control systems fail to compensate the fluctuations; the wholeplant will suffer from dynamics that is reinforced by the closed-loop controls.

GRAPPLE: Integrating adaptive learning into learning management systems,Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Kees Van Der Sluijs; David Smits,Abstract GRAPPLE is an EU funded IST FP7 project that brings together a group ofresearchers into adaptive learning technology and environments and developers of learningmanagement systems (LMSs); in order to offer adaptive learning as a standard feature offuture LMSs. This papers presents the overall architecture of GRAPPLE; and explains someof the main challenges in creating a truly general-purpose adaptive learning environment(ALE) that can be used with different LMSs and a distributed architecture of user modelingservices. In particular the paper describes the conceptual adaptation model; its translationinto adaptation rules; and some technological challenge that results from separating theconcerns of adaptation and user modeling.,EdMedia: World Conference on Educational Media and Technology,2008,24
Beating the baseline prediction in food sales: How intelligent an intelligent predictor is?,Indrė Žliobaitė; Jorn Bakker; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Sales prediction is an essential part of stock planning for the wholesales and retailbusiness. It is a complex task because of the large number of factors affecting the demand.Designing an intelligent predictor that would beat a simple moving average baseline acrossa number of products appears to be a non-trivial task. We present an intelligent two levelsales prediction approach that switches the predictors depending on the properties of thehistorical sales. First; we learn how to categorize the sales time series into 'predictable'and'random'based on structural; shape and relational features related to the products and theenvironment using meta learning approach. We introduce a set of novel meta features tocapture behavior; shape and relational properties of the sales time series. Next; for theproducts identified as 'predictable'we apply an intelligent base predictor; while for ' …,Expert Systems with Applications,2012,23
Adaptation of elaborated feedback in e-learning,Ekaterina Vasilyeva; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Paul De Bra,Abstract Design of feedback is a critical issue of online assessment development within Web-based Learning Systems (WBLSs). In our work we demonstrate the possibilities of tailoringthe feedback to the students' learning style (LS); certitude in response and its correctness.We observe in the experimental studies that these factors have a significant influence on thefeedback preferences of students and the effectiveness of elaborated feedback (EF); iestudents' performance improvement during the test. These observations helped us todevelop a simple EF recommendation approach. Our experimental study shows that (1)many students are eager to follow the recommendations on necessity to read certain EF inthe majority of cases;(2) the students more often find the recommended EF to be useful; and(3) the recommended EF helped to answer related questions better.,International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems,2008,22
Generic adaptation framework: a process-oriented perspective,Evgeny Knutov; Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS) have long been mainly represented bydomain-or application-specific systems. Few reference models exist and they provide only abrief overview of how to describe and organize theadaptation process' in a generic way. Inthis paper we consider the process aspects of AHS from the very first classicalusermodelling-adaptation'loop to a generic detailed flowchart of the adaptation in AHS. Weintroduce a Generic Adaptation Process and by aligning it with a layered (data-oriented)AHS architecture we show that it can serve as the process part of a new reference model forAHS.,Journal of Digital Information,2011,21

HyDR-MI: A hybrid algorithm to reduce dimensionality in multiple instance learning,Amelia Zafra; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Sebastián Ventura,Abstract Feature selection techniques have been successfully applied in many applicationsfor making supervised learning more effective and efficient. These techniques have beenwidely used and studied in traditional supervised learning settings; where each instance isexpected to have a label. In multiple instance learning (MIL) each example or bag consistsof a variable set of instances; and the label is known for the bag as a whole; but not for theindividual instances it consists of. Therefore utilizing these labels for feature selection in MILbecomes less straightforward. In this paper we study a new feature subset selection methodfor MIL called HyDR-MI (hybrid dimensionality reduction method for multiple instancelearning). The hybrid consists of the filter component based on an extension of the ReliefFalgorithm developed for working with MIL and the wrapper component based on a …,Information Sciences,2013,19

In thispaper we present a white-box data leakage detection system to spot anomalies in databasetransactions. We argue that our approach represents a major leap forward wrt previous workbecause: i) it significantly decreases the False Positive Rate (FPR) while keeping theDetection Rate (DR) high; on our experimental dataset; consisting of millions of realenterprise transactions; we measure a FPR that is orders of magnitude lower than in state-of-the-art comparable approaches; and ii) the white-box approach allows the creation of self-explanatory and easy to update profiles able to explain why a given query is anomalous;which further boosts the practical applicability of the system.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2014,18
Cross-lingual polarity detection with machine translation,Erkin Demirtas; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Recent advancements in machine translation foster an interest of its use insentiment analysis. In this paper; we investigate prospects and limitations of machinetranslation in sentiment analysis for cross-lingual polarity detection task. We focus onimproving classification accuracy in a cross-lingual setting where we have available labeledtraining instances about particular domain in different languages. We experiment with moviereview and product review datasets consisting of polar texts in English and Turkish. Theresults of the study show that expanding training size with new instances taken from anothercorpus does not necessarily increase classification accuracy. And this happens primarily notdue to (not always accurate) machine translation; but because of the inherent differences incorpora between two subsets written in different languages.

Towards context aware food sales prediction,Indre Žliobaite; Jorn Bakker; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Sales prediction is a complex task because of a large number of factors affecting thedemand. We present a context aware sales prediction approach; which selects the basepredictor depending on the structural properties of the historical sales. In the experimentalpart we show that there exist product subsets on which; using this strategy; it is possible tooutperform naive methods. We also show the dependencies between product categorizationaccuracies and sales prediction accuracies. A case study of a food wholesaler indicates thatmoving average prediction can be outperformed by intelligent methods; if propercategorization is in place; which appears to be a difficult task.,Data Mining Workshops; 2009.

A framework for guiding the museum tours personalization,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Toon Calders,Abstract. The importance of web access personalization to cultural heritage has beenrecognized by many museums. Recent research in recommender systems; informationretrieval and data mining has facilitated the development of personalized applications. Thisresearch provides a number of intelligent technologies for supporting user navigation;information filtering; and other important processes of a user-centered interactive informationexchange between museum websites and their visitors. In this paper we study some of thechallenges of personalizing museum tours. We focus on (i) the efficient learning of usermodels in offline and online settings; and (ii) the scientific evaluation of a personalizationeffect. Given few examples of the preferences of a user; the system must learn to suggest themost relevant artworks.

Predictive handling of asynchronous concept drifts in distributed environments,Hock Hee Ang; Vivekanand Gopalkrishnan; Indre Zliobaite; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Steven CH Hoi,In a distributed computing environment; peers collaboratively learn to classify concepts ofinterest from each other. When external changes happen and their concepts drift; the peersshould adapt to avoid increase in misclassification errors. The problem of adaptationbecomes more difficult when the changes are asynchronous; ie; when peers experiencedrifts at different times. We address this problem by developing an ensemble approach;PINE; that combines reactive adaptation via drift detection; and proactive handling ofupcoming changes via early warning and adaptation across the peers. With empirical studyon simulated and real-world data sets; we show that PINE handles asynchronous conceptdrifts better and faster than current state-of-the-art approaches; which have been designedto work in less challenging environments. In addition; PINE is parameter insensitive and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,16
Towards more relevance-oriented data mining research,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Seppo Puuronen; Alexey Tsymbal,Abstract Data mining (DM) research has successfully developed advanced DM techniquesand algorithms over the last few decades; and many organisations have great expectationsto take more benefit of their data warehouses in decision making. Currently; the strong focusof most DM-researchers is still only on technology-oriented topics. Commonly the DMresearch has several stakeholders; the major of which can be divided into internal andexternal ones each having their own point of view; and which are at least partly conflicting.The most important internal groups of stakeholders are the DM research community andacademics in other disciplines. The most important external stakeholder groups aremanagers and domain experts who have their own utility-based interests to DM and DMresearch results. In this paper we discuss these practice-oriented points of view towards …,Intelligent Data Analysis,2008,16
The MOOClet framework: Improving online education through experimentation and personalization of modules,Joseph Williams; Na Li; Juho Kim; Jacob Whitehill; Samuel Maldonado; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Larry Chu; Neil Heffernan,Abstract One goal for massive open online courses is that the educational benefits theyprovide scale as a function of the number and diversity of learners interacting with theplatforms; since an increasing amount of data is available about what interactions andcontent increase engagement and learning; as well as which educational interactions areeffective for which learners; particularly since more and more is known about eachindividual. This paper presents the MOOClet Framework for tackling this goal; whichrecognizes a key relationship between randomized experiments and personalization ofcontent. The Framework defines MOOClets as modular components of online courses thatcan be modified to create different versions; which in turn can be iteratively and adaptivelyimproved through experiments and personalized to characteristics of users.

Predicting current user intent with contextual markov models,Julia Kiseleva; Hoang Thanh Lam; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Toon Calders,In many web information systems like e-shops and information portals predictive modeling isused to understand user intentions based on their browsing behavior. User behavior isinherently sensitive to various contexts. Identifying such relevant contexts can help toimprove the prediction performance. In this work; we propose a formal approach in which thecontext discovery process is defined as an optimization problem. For simplicity we assume aconcrete yet generic scenario in which context is considered to be a secondary label of aninstance that is either known from the available contextual attribute (eg user location) or canbe induced from the training data (eg novice vs. expert user). In an ideal case; the objectivefunction of the optimization problem has an analytical form enabling us to design a contextdiscovery algorithm solving the optimization problem directly.

Context-aware personal route recognition,Oleksiy Mazhelis; Indrė Žliobaitė; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Personal route recognition is an important element of intelligent transportationsystems. The results may be used for providing personal information about location-specificevents; services; emergency or disaster situations; for location-specific advertising andmore. Existing real-time route recognition systems often compare the current drivingtrajectory against the trajectories observed in past and select the most similar route as themost likely. The problem is that such systems are inaccurate in the beginning of a trip; astypically several different routes start at the same departure point (eg home). In suchsituations the beginnings of trajectories overlap and the trajectory alone is insufficient torecognize the route. This drawback limits the utilization of route prediction systems; sinceaccurate predictions are needed as early as possible; not at the end of the trip.

It was shown that; for anensemble to be successful; it should consist of accurate and diverse base classifiers.However; it is also important that the integration procedure in the ensemble should properlyutilize the ensemble diversity. In this paper; we present an algorithm for the dynamicintegration of classifiers in the space of extracted features (FEDIC). It is based on thetechnique of dynamic integration; in which local accuracy estimates are calculated for eachbase classifier of an ensemble; in the neighborhood of a new instance to be processed.Generally; the whole space of original features is used to find the neighborhood of a newinstance for local accuracy estimates in dynamic integration.

User behavior is inherently sensitive to various hidden contexts. It has beenshown in different experimental studies that exploitation of contextual information can help inimproving prediction performance significantly. It is reasonable to assume that users maychange their intents during one web session and that changes are influenced by someexternal factors such as switch in temporal context eg'users want to find information about aspecific product'and after a while'they want to buy this product'.

Diversity in random subspacing ensembles,Alexey Tsymbal; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Pádraig Cunningham,Abstract Ensembles of learnt models constitute one of the main current directions in machinelearning and data mining. It was shown experimentally and theoretically that in order for anensemble to be effective; it should consist of classifiers having diversity in their predictions. Anumber of ways are known to quantify diversity in ensembles; but little research has beendone about their appropriateness. In this paper; we compare eight measures of theensemble diversity with regard to their correlation with the accuracy improvement due toensembles. We conduct experiments on 21 data sets from the UCI machine learningrepository; comparing the correlations for random subspacing ensembles with differentensemble sizes and with six different ensemble integration methods.

Techniques for discrimination-free predictive models,Faisal Kamiran; Toon Calders; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract In this chapter; we give an overview of the techniques developed ourselves forconstructing discrimination-free classifiers. In discrimination-free classification the goal is tolearn a predictive model that classifies future data objects as accurately as possible; yet thepredicted labels should be uncorrelated to a given sensitive attribute. For example; the taskcould be to learn a gender-neutral model that predicts whether a potential client of a bankhas a high income or not. The techniques we developed for discrimination-awareclassification can be divided into three categories:(1) removing the discrimination directlyfrom the historical dataset before an off-the-shelf classification technique is applied;(2)changing the learning procedures themselves by restricting the search space to non-discriminatory models; and (3) adjusting the discriminatory models; learnt by off-the-shelf …,*,2013,10

Food sales prediction:" If only it knew what we know",Patrick Meulstee; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Sales prediction is an important problem for different companies involved in manufacturing;logistics; marketing; wholesaling and retailing. Food companies are more concerned withsales prediction of products having a short shelf-life and seasonal changes in demand. Thedemand may depend on many hidden contexts; not given explicitly in the form of predictivefeatures. Even if some changes are known to be seasonal; predicting (and even detecting)when season will start and end remains to be non-trivial. In this paper we present anensemble learning approach that employs dynamic integration of classifier for betterhandling of seasonal changes and fluctuations in consumer demands.

Knowledge management challenges in knowledge discovery systems,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal; Seppo Puuronen,Current knowledge discovery systems are armed with many data mining techniques that canbe potentially applied to a new problem. However; a system faces a challenge of selectingthe most appropriate technique (s) for a problem at hand; since in the real domain area it isinfeasible to perform a comparison of all applicable techniques. The main goal of this paperis to consider the limitations of data-driven approaches and propose a knowledge-drivenapproach to enhance the use of multiple data-mining strategies in a knowledge discoverysystem.

Towards the generic framework for utility considerations in data mining research,Seppo Puuronen; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Rigor data mining (DM) research has successfully developed advanced datamining techniques and algorithms; and many organizations have great expectations to takemore benefit of their vast data warehouses in decision making. Even when there are somesuccess stories the current status in practice is mainly including great expectations that havenot yet been fulfilled. DM researchers have recently become interested in utility-based DM(UBDM) starting to consider some of the economic utility factors (like cost of data; cost ofmeasurement; cost of class label and so forth); but yet many other utility factors are leftoutside the main directions of UBDM. The goal of this position paper is (1) to motivateresearchers to consider utility from broader perspective than usually done in UBDM contextand (2) to introduce a new generic framework for these broader utility considerations in …,Proceedings of the 2010 conference on Data Mining for Business Applications,2010,9
Local dimensionality reduction and supervised learning within natural clusters for biomedical data analysis,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal; Seppo Puuronen,Inductive learning systems were successfully applied in a number of medical domains.Nevertheless; the effective use of these systems often requires data preprocessing beforeapplying a learning algorithm. This is especially important for multidimensionalheterogeneous data presented by a large number of features of different types.Dimensionality reduction (DR) is one commonly applied approach. The goal of this paper isto study the impact of natural clustering-clustering according to expert domain knowledge-onDR for supervised learning (SL) in the area of antibiotic resistance.

A survey on using domain and contextual knowledge for human activity recognition in video streams,Leonardo Onofri; Paolo Soda; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Giulio Iannello,Abstract Human activity recognition has gained an increasing relevance in computer visionand it can be tackled with either non-hierarchical or hierarchical approaches. The former;also known as single-layered approaches; are those that represent and recognize humanactivities directly from the extracted descriptors; building a model that distinguishes amongthe activities contained in the training data. The latter represent and recognize humanactivities in terms of subevents; which are usually recognized my means of single-layeredapproaches. Alongside of non-hierarchical and hierarchical approaches; we observe thatmethods incorporating a priori knowledge and context information on the activity are gettinggrowing interest within the community. In this work we refer to this emerging trend incomputer vision as knowledge-based human activity recognition with the objective to …,*,2016,8
RBEM: a rule based approach to polarity detection,Erik Tromp; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract We propose the Rule-Based Emission Model (RBEM) algorithm for polaritydetection. RBEM uses several kinds of heuristic rules to create an emissive model onpolarity patterns. We extensively experiment with our approach on English and Dutchmessages extracted from Twitter. Thus we also illustrate that RBEM can be used inmultilingual settings and is applicable to social media characterized by use of not alwaysregular language constructs. We demonstrate that designing such an algorithm instead ofapplying the state-of-the art general purpose classification techniques is a reasonablechoice for the automated sentiment classification in practice. Using RBEM we can design acompetitive multilingual sentiment classification system showing promising accuracy resultsof 78.8% on the considered datasets. We provide some further evidence that RBEM …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Issues of Sentiment Discovery and Opinion Mining,2013,8

Learning with actionable attributes: Attention--boundary cases!,Indre Žliobaite; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Traditional supervised learning assumes that instances are described by observableattributes. The goal is to learn to predict the labels for unseen instances. In many real worldapplications the values of some attributes are not only observable; but can be proactivelychosen by a decision maker. Furthermore; in some of such applications the decision makeris interested not only to generate accurate predictions; but to maximize the probability of thedesired outcome. For example; a direct marketing manager can choose the color of anenvelope (actionable attribute); in which the offer is sent to a client; hoping that the rightchoice will result in a positive response with a higher probability. We study how to learn tochoose the value of an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desiredoutcome in supervised learning settings.

OMFP: An approach for online mass flow prediction in CFB boilers,Indrė Žliobaitė; Jorn Bakker; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Fuel feeding and inhomogeneity of fuel typically cause process fluctuations in thecirculating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers. If control systems fail to compensate the fluctuations;the whole plant will suffer from fluctuations that are reinforced by the closed-loop controls.Accurate estimates of fuel consumption among other factors are needed for control systemsoperation. In this paper we address a problem of online mass flow prediction. Particularly;we consider the problems of (1) constructing the ground truth;(2) handling noise and abruptconcept drift; and (3) learning an accurate predictor. Last but not least we emphasize theimportance of having the domain knowledge concerning the considered case.

Feature extraction for dynamic integration of classifiers,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal; Seppo Puuronen; David Patterson,Abstract Recent research has shown the integration of multiple classifiers to be one of themost important directions in machine learning and data mining. In this paper; we present analgorithm for the dynamic integration of classifiers in the space of extracted features (FEDIC).It is based on the technique of dynamic integration; in which local accuracy estimates arecalculated for each base classifier of an ensemble; in the neighborhood of a new instance tobe processed. Generally; the whole space of original features is used to find theneighborhood of a new instance for local accuracy estimates in dynamic integration.However; when dynamic integration takes place in high dimensions the search for theneighborhood of a new instance is problematic; since the majority of space is empty andneighbors can in fact be located far from each other. Furthermore; when noisy or …,Fundamenta Informaticae,2007,7
Competitive advantage from Data Mining: some lessons learnt in the Information Systems field,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Seppo Puuronen; Alexey Tsymbal,Data mining (DM) is still a technology having great expectations to enable organizations totake more benefit of their huge databases. There exist some success stories whereorganizations have managed to have competitive advantage of DM. Still the strong focus ofmost DM-researchers in technology-oriented topics does not support expanding the scopein less rigorous but practically very relevant sub-areas. The current situation with DM hassimilarities with situations during the development of some other information technology (IT)-related sub-areas earlier. Research in the information systems discipline (one of those IT-related sub-areas) has strong traditions to take into account human and organizationalaspects of systems beside the technical ones.

Mining exceptional relationships with grammar-guided genetic programming,Jose Maria Luna; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Sebastian Ventura,Abstract Given a database of records; it might be possible to identify small subsets of datawhich distribution is exceptionally different from the distribution in the complete set of datarecords. Finding such interesting relationships; which we call exceptional relationships; inan automated way would allow discovering unusual or exceptional hidden behaviour. In thispaper; we formulate the problem of mining exceptional relationships as a special case ofexceptional model mining and propose a grammar-guided genetic programming algorithm(MERG3P) that enables the discovery of any exceptional relationships. In particular;MERG3P can work directly not only with categorical; but also with numerical data.

Pattern-based emotion classification on social media,Erik Tromp; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Sentiment analysis can go beyond the typical granularity of polarity that assumeseach text to be positive; negative or neural. Indeed; human emotions are much morediverse; and it is interesting to study how to define a more complete set of emotions and howto deduce these emotions from human-written messages. In this book chapter we argue thatusing Plutchik's wheel of emotions model and a rule-based approach for emotion detectionin text makes it a good framework for emotion classification on social media. We provide adetailed description of how to define rule-based patterns for Plutchik's wheel emotiondetection; how to learn them from the annotated social media and how to apply them forclassifying emotions in the previously unseen texts.

Reducing dimensionality in multiple instance learning with a filter method,Amelia Zafra; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Sebastián Ventura,Abstract In this article; we describe a feature selection algorithm which can automatically findrelevant features for multiple instance learning. Multiple instance learning is considered anextension of traditional supervised learning where each example is made up of severalinstances and there is no specific information about particular instance labels. In thisscenario; traditional supervised learning can not be applied directly and it is necessary todesign new techniques. Our approach is based on principles of the well-known Relief-Falgorithm which is extended to select features in this new learning paradigm by modifyingthe distance; the difference function and computation of the weight of the features. Fourdifferent variants of this algorithm are proposed to evaluate their performance in this newlearning framework.

On the Use of Information Systems Research Methods in Datamining,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Seppo Puuronen; Alexey Tsymbal,Information systems are powerful instruments for organizational problem solving throughformal information processing (Lyytinen; 1987). Data mining (DM) and knowledge discoveryare intelligent tools that help to accumulate and process data and make use of it (Fayyad;1996). Data mining bridges many technical areas; including databases; statistics; machinelearning; and human-computer interaction. The set of data mining processes used to extractand verify patterns in data is the core of the knowledge discovery process. Numerous datamining techniques have recently been developed to extract knowledge from largedatabases. The area of data mining is historically more related to AI (Artificial Intelligence);pattern recognition; statistical; and database communities; though we think there is noobjective reason for that. And nowadays; although the field of data mining according to …,*,2005,6

In this paper; we design an automatic gradingapproach for short answers; based on the non-negative semi-supervised documentclustering method. After assigning several answer keys; our approach is able to group thelarge amount of short answers into multiple sets; and output the score for each answerautomatically. In this manner; the effort of teachers can be greatly reduced. Moreover; ourapproach allows the interaction with teachers; and therefore the system performance couldbe further enhanced.

Feature selection is the ReliefF for multiple instance learning,Amelia Zafra; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Sebastián Ventura,Dimensionality reduction and feature selection in particular are known to be of a great helpfor making supervised learning more effective and efficient. Many different feature selectiontechniques have been proposed for the traditional settings; where each instance is expectedto have a label. In multiple instance learning (MIL) each example or bag consists of avariable set of instances; and the label is known for the bag as a whole; but not for theindividual instances it consists of. Therefore; utilizing class labels for feature selection in MILis not that straightforward and traditional approaches for feature selection are not directlyapplicable. This paper proposes a filter feature selection approach based on the ReliefFtechnique.

Keynote Paper: Data Mining Researcher; Who is Your Customer? Some Issues Inspired by the Information Systems Field,Seppo Puuronen; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal,Data mining as an applied research field is still causing great expectations amongorganizations which want to raise the utility they are getting from their huge databases anddata warehouses. There exist too few success stories about organizations having managedto satisfy even some of those expectations. This situation is very similar to the one inside theinformation systems (IS) field; especially earlier but even currently. The recent lively debateabout the identity of the IS discipline included also the analysis concerning the customers ofIS research. Inspired by IS researchers' insights related to the topic; we ask the question"who is our customer?" as data mining researchers. With this we want to raise to discussionthe border that limits the topics' acceptable'to work with as a data mining researcher. Wesuggest in this paper that the border should be transferred more clearly towards the …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2006. DEXA'06. 17th International Workshop on,2006,3

On structure preserving sampling and approximate partitioning of graphs,Wouter van Heeswijk; George HL Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Massive graphs are becoming increasingly common in a variety of domains such associal networks and web analytics. One approach to overcoming the challenges of size is tosample the graph; and perform analytics on the smaller graph. However; to be useful; thesample must maintain the properties of interest in the original graph. In this paper; weanalyze the quality of five representative sampling algorithms in how well they preservegraph structure; the bisimulation structure of graphs in particular. As part of this study; wealso develop a new scalable algorithm for computing bisimulation partitions of massivegraphs. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithm in bothsequential and distributed settings.,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,2
Expected goals in soccer: Explaining match results using predictive analytics,HP Eggels,Abstract Where data based decision making is taking over businesses and elite sports; elitesoccer is lacking behind. In elite soccer; decisions are still often based on emotions andrecent results. As results are; however; dependent on many aspects; the reasons for theseresults are currently unknown by the elite soccer clubs. In our study; a method is proposed todetermine the expected winner of a match. Since goals are rare in soccer; goal scoringopportunities are analyzed instead. By analyzing which team created the best goal scoringopportunities; a feeling can be created which team should have won the game. Therefore; itis important that the quality of goal scoring opportunities accurately reflect reality. Therefore;the proposed method ensures that the quality of a goal scoring opportunity is given as theprobability of the goal scoring opportunity resulting in a goal. It is shown that these scores …,The Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics workshop,2016,2

Decomposing a sequence into independent subsequences using compression algorithms,Hoang Thanh Lam; Julia Kiseleva; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Toon Calders,ABSTRACT Given a sequence generated by a random mixture of independent processes;we study compression-based methods for decomposing the sequence into independentsubsequences each corresponds to an independent process. We first show that thedecomposition which results in the optimal compression length in expectation actuallycorresponds to an independent decomposition. This theoretical result encourages us to lookfor the decomposition that incurs the minimum description length to solve the independentdecomposition problem. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed to find thatdecomposition. We perform experiments with both synthetic and real-life datasets to showthe effectiveness of our method in comparison with the state of the art method.,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Interactive Data Exploration and Analytic,2014,2

ACLAC: An approach for adaptive closed-loop anesthesia control,Ayoze Marrero; Juan A Mendez; Alexandr V Maslov; Mykola Pechenizkiy,In current practice; to control the anesthetic process; the anesthetist delivers drugs accordingto the surgery procedure and to the current patient characteristics and state. This is an open-loop procedure requiring an active participation of the medical expert. We propose anadaptive closed-loop controller for the regulation of hypnosis for patients undergoinggeneral anesthesia. One of the main problems arising when designing such a controller isrelated to the intra-and inter-patient variability. We employ a simple regression model tomake prediction of patient's response and to compute the adequate doses of propofol tokeep the patient in the specified Bispectral Index target. To make our model adaptive; wecontinuously monitor the patient behavior and detect changes in patient response to updatethe identification model.

Quantile index for gradual and abrupt change detection from CFB boiler sensor data in online settings,Alexandr Maslov; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Tommi Kärkkäinen; Matti Tähtinen,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of online detection of gradual and abruptchanges in sensor data having high levels of noise and outliers. We propose a simpleheuristic method based on the Quantile Index (QI) and study how robust this method is fordetecting both gradual and abrupt changes with such data. We evaluate the performance ofour method on the artificially generated and real datasets that represent different operationalsettings of a pilot circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor and CFB cold model. Ourexperiments suggest that QI can be used for designing very simple yet effective methods forgradual change detection in the noisy sensor data. It can be also used for detecting abruptchanges in the data unless they occur too often one after another.,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data,2012,2
Technologies for dealing with information overload: An engineer's point of view,Toon Calders; George HL Fletcher; Faisal Kamiran; Mykola Pechenizkiy,ABSTRACT In this chapter; we provide an overview of the technological side of theinformation overload problem. We discuss the challenges and opportunities offered by theever-growing and emerging stream of information from an engineering point of view. Moreconcretely; we survey storage and querying techniques for semistructured data; data mining;and information retrieval for analyzing large data collections; and then survey streamprocessing techniques for online handling of continuously flowing data. In this way; we covera whole spectrum of different levels of “structuredness” of data. At one end of the spectrum;there is data that; although only loosely structured; can still be organized in some way. At theother end; there are data streams that come in at such a fast pace that even storing them isno longer a valid option. Rather; we need to rely on immediate processing and …,Information Overload: An International Challenge for Professional Engineers and Technical Communicators,2012,2

Handling Concept Drift in Information Systems,I Zliobaite; M Pechenizkiy,Realism of the perfect world assumptions often made in machine learning has been challengedyears ago [24]. One of these challenges relates to an observation that in the real world data isoften non stationary. When there is a shift in data; the predictions might become less accurateas the time passes or opportunities to improve the accuracy might be missed. Thus the learningmodels need to be adaptive to the changes. In predictive analytics; machine learning and datamining the phenomenon of unexpected change in underlying data over time is known as conceptdrift [42;63;66]. Changes in underlying data might occur due to changing personal interests; changesin population; adversary activities or they can be attributed to a complex nature of theenvironment. The problem of concept drift is of increasing importance to machine learning anddata mining as more and more data is organized in the form of data streams rather than …,*,2010,2
Generic adaptation process,Evgeny Knutov; PD Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract. Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS) have long been mainly represented bydomain-or application-specific systems. Few reference models exist and they provide only abrief overview of how to describe and organize the 'adaptation process' in a generic way. Inthis paper we consider the process aspects of AHS from the very first classical 'usermodelling-adaptation'loop to a generic detailed flowchart of the adaptation in AHS. Weintroduce a Generic Adaptation Process and by aligning it with a layered (data-oriented)AHS architecture we show that it can serve as the process part of a new reference model forAHS.,Proceedings of the WABBWUAS’2010 Workshop on Architectures and Building Blocks of Web-based User-Adaptive Systems,2010,2
Using a satisfiability solver to identify deterministic finite state automata,Marijn JH Heule; Sicco Verwer,Abstract We present an exact algorithm for identification of deterministic finite automata(DFA) which is based on satisfiability (SAT) solvers. Despite the size of the low level SATrepresentation; our approach seems to be competitive with alternative techniques. Ourcontributions are threefold: First; we propose a compact translation of DFA identification intoSAT. Second; we reduce the SAT search space by adding lower bound information using afast max-clique approximation algorithm. Third; we include many redundant clauses toprovide the SAT solver with some additional knowledge about the problem. Experiments ona well-known suite of random DFA identification problems show that SAT solvers canefficiently tackle all instances. Moreover; our exact algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arttechniques on several hard problems.,BNAIC,2009,2
On combining principal components with Fisher's linear discriminants for supervised learning,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal; Seppo Puuronen,Abstract.“The curse of dimensionality” is pertinent to many learning algorithms; and itdenotes the drastic increase of computational complexity and classification error in highdimensions. In this paper; principal component analysis (PCA); parametric feature extraction(FE) based on Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA); and their combination as meansof dimensionality reduction are analysed with respect to the performance of differentclassifiers. Three commonly used classifiers are taken for analysis: kNN; Naïve Bayes andC4. 5 decision tree. Recently; it has been argued that it is extremely important to use classinformation in FE for supervised learning (SL). However; LDA-based FE; although usingclass information; has a serious shortcoming due to its parametric nature.

This has been raising a natural interest within the academicresearch and industry to develop approaches and solutions for ubiquitous sentimentanalysis. However; we can observe that most of the academic research focuses on adoptingstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques for sentiment classification and elements ofnatural language processing for feature construction and evaluate them on benchmarkdatasets not regarding much the actual application settings. In industry the focus is ondeveloping platforms; services and customized solutions for certain applications and fordifferent domains.

Modelling embodied mobility teamwork strategies in a simulation-based healthcare classroom,Roberto Martinez-Maldonado; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Simon Buckingham-Shum; Tamara Power; Carolyn Hayes; Carmen Axisa,Abstract In many situations; it remains critical for team members to develop strategies toeffectively use the space and tools available to complete demanding tasks. However;despite the availability of sensors and analytics for instrumenting physical space; relativelylittle progress has been made in modelling the embodied dimensions of co-locatedteamwork. This paper explores an in-the-wild pilot study through which we explore amethodology to model embodied mobility teamwork strategies in the context of healthcareeducation. We developed the means for tracking; clustering and processing student-nurses'mobility data around a patient manikin. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach bydiscussing ways to make sense of these data to uncover meaningful trends; and the inherentchallenges of applying physical space analytics in authentic settings.,Proceedings of the 25th Conference on User Modeling; Adaptation and Personalization,2017,1

Thus; moststudent behavioural data are limited to the interactions between students and particularlearning applications. However; learning can also occur beyond these interface interactions;for instance while students interact face-to-face with other students or their teachers.Alternatively; some learning tasks may require students to interact with non-digital physicaltools; to use the physical space; or to learn in different ways that cannot be mediated bytraditional user interfaces (eg motor and/or audio learning).

Predictive Performance and Discrimination in Unbalanced Classification,SB van der Zon; M Pechenizkiy; N Zannone; A Serebrenik,Abstract In this thesis; we investigate two types of problems in classifier construction. First;we focus on the problem of class imbalance. We acknowledge that common accuracymetrics such as accuracy and precision are not appropriate to evaluate performance of aclassifier for an imbalanced dataset; and therefore consider existing solutions including theROC-curve and Kappa statistic; and extend the notion of the ROC-curve to a new single-value performance identifier “ROC-distance”. We employ several methods that reduce classimbalance; using variable support for itemsets; and synthetically oversampling the minorityclass; using techniques that preserve the original characteristics of a dataset; while creatingan equal amount of samples for both classes. Secondly; we focus on the problem of fairnessand discrimination in classifiers. Classifiers that learn from socially sensitive data; can …,*,2016,1
Node classification in dynamic social networks,Yulong Pei; Jianpeng Zhang; George HL Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract. Classifying nodes in networks is different from traditional classification tasks sincethe iid assumption does not hold. In a dynamic scenario; nodes/edges may change duringtime which makes node classification more difficult. There have been a number of studies onnode classification in networks in recent years but one limitation exists: how to make use ofthe temporal information. In this paper; we propose the dynamic Factor Graph Model(dFGM); which is an extension of Factor Graph Models; for the problem of node classificationin dynamic social networks. dFGM can capture not only node attributes and correlations butalso the temporal information for node classification. We conduct experiments on a real-world data set and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposedmethod.,Proceedings of AALTD 2016: Second ECML/PKDD International Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data,2016,1
Structural measures of clustering quality on graph samples,Jianpeng Zhang; Yulong Pei; George HL Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Due to the growing presence of large-scale and streaming graphs such as social networks;graph sampling and clustering play an important role in many real-world applications. Onekey aspect of graph clustering is the evaluation of cluster quality. However; little attentionhas been paid to evaluation measures for clustering quality on samples of graphs. As firststeps towards appropriate evaluation of clustering methods on sampled graphs; in this workwe present two novel evaluation measures for graph clustering called δ-precision and δ-recall. These measures effectively reflect the match quality of the clusters in the sampledgraph with respect to the ground-truth clusters in the original graph. We show in extensiveexperiments on various benchmarks that our proposed metrics are practical and effective forgraph clustering evaluation.,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2016,1

Modelling recurrent events for improving online change detection,Alexandr Maslov; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Indreė Žliobaitė; Tommi Kärkkäinen,Abstract The task of online change point detection in sensor data streams is oftencomplicated due to presence of noise that can be mistaken for real changes and thereforeaffecting performance of change detectors. Most of the existing change detection methodsassume that changes are independent from each other and occur at random in time. In thispaper we study how performance of detectors can be improved in case of recurrentchanges. We analytically demonstrate under which conditions and for how long recurrenceinformation is useful for improving the detection accuracy. We propose a simplecomputationally efficient message passing procedure for calculating a predictive probabilitydistribution of change occurrence in the future. We demonstrate two straightforward ways toapply the proposed procedure to existing change detection algorithms. Our experimental …,*,2016,1
Application of horizontal visibility graph as a robust measure of neurophysiological signals synchrony,Negar Ahmadi; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Finding synchronization between the signals of a neural system such as the brain (as adynamic chaotic system) has a critical role in characterizing the system activities andintegration of information within and across a disorder. Therefore; applying asynchronization measure; which is able to capture the important features of the system; hasa great effect on the results. In this paper; we propose the horizontal visibility graph (HVG)method as a new; straightforward and fast method to measure synchronization betweenbrain signals. By using the HVG method; a signal is mapped into a graph network and thesignals properties are captured well. Our analysis shows that the proposed method is arobust and reliable measure for finding synchronization between signals of a dynamicchaotic (non-) noisy system.

In this paper; we address this problem proposing a new manifolddistance measure; which can better capture both local and global spatial manifoldinformation. We define a new way of local density estimation accounting for the densitycharacteristic. It represents local density more accurately. Meanwhile; it is less sensitive tothe parameter settings.

In elite soccer; decisions are often based on recent results and emotions. In thispaper; we propose a method to determine the expected winner of a match in elite soccer.The expected result of a soccer match is determined by estimating the probability of scoringfor the individual goal scoring opportunities. The outcome of a match is then obtained byintegrating these probabilities. In our experimental study; we show that the probabilities ofgoal scoring opportunities accurately match reality.,MLSA; Riva del Garda; Italy,2016,1

Learning to Teach like a Bandit,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Pedro A Toledo,ABSTRACT Designing a good course curriculum is a non-trivial task many teachers have todeal with on a regular basis. There are multiple learning methodologies available; but someof the basics are common; thus; one of the important steps is to identify key concepts andknowledge or skills prerequisites for mastering them. If this can be done properly; a teacheracting as a course designer can think how to sequence the material.

Predicting multi-class customer profiles based on transactions: a case study in food sales,Edward Apeh; Indrė Žliobaitė; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Bogdan Gabrys,Abstract Predicting the class of customer profiles is a key task in marketing; which enablesbusinesses to approach the customers in a right way to satisfy the customer's evolvingneeds. However; due to costs; privacy and/or data protection; only the business' ownedtransactional data is typically available for constructing customer profiles. We present a newapproach that is designed to efficiently and accurately handle the multi-class classification ofcustomer profiles built using sparse and skewed transactional data. Our approach first binsthe customer profiles on the basis of the number of items transacted. The discovered binsare then partitioned and prototypes within each of the discovered bins selected to build themulti-class classifier models. The results obtained from using four multi-class classifiers onreal-world transactional data consistently show the critical numbers of items at which the …,*,2012,1
Adaptive hypermedia systems analysis approach by means of the GAF framework,Evgeny Knutov; Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract. Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS) have long been concentrating on adaptiveguidance of links between domain concepts with lots of custom developments and ad-hocimplementations. Here we consider a formalization approach to AHS composition anddesign by defining building blocks' interfaces and presenting corresponding dependenciesby means of the GAF framework. This helps to identify system design guidelines and startbuilding adaptive system from scratch as well as analyze adaptive system behaviour;architecture and risks involved.,Second international Workshop on Dynamic and Adaptive Hypertext,2011,1

Handling concept drift in medical applications: Importance; challenges and solutions,Mykola Pechenizkiy; Indre Zliobaite,In the real world data is often non stationary. In supervised learning; concept drift means thatthe statistical properties of the target variable; which the model aims to predict; change overtime unexpectedly. This causes problems because the predictions might become lessaccurate as the time passes or opportunities to improve the accuracy might be missed. Withthe proposed tutorial we intend to reach the following goals: 1) highlight the importance ofconcept drift handling mechanisms in medical applications; 2) overview existing approachesfor handling different types of drift in supervised learning; emphasizing the underlyingassumptions that these approaches implicitly or explicitly make about the nature and causesof changes; 3) discuss practical aspects of applying drift handling mechanisms to a widerange of medical applications and present a foreseen development in this field.,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2010,1

In order to maintain and improve the quality of care without exploding costs;healthcare systems are undergoing a paradigm shift from patient care in the hospital topatient care at home. Remote patient management (RPM) systems offer a great potential inreducing hospitalization costs and worsening of symptoms for patients with chronicdiseases; eg; heart failure and diabetes. Different types of data collected by RPM systemsprovide an opportunity for personalizing information services; and alerting medicalpersonnel about the changing conditions of the patient. In this work we focus on a particularproblem of patient modeling that is the hospitalization prediction. We consider the problemdefinition; our approach to this problem; highlight the results of the experimental study andreflect on their use in decision making.,Adjunct Proceedings,2010,1

Hybrid Recommendation Engine Based on Anonymous Users,Mehmet ÇUBUK,Abstract In this thesis we developed a hybrid recommendation engine for a travel companyand web mining is used to gather data for making recommendations. Also we gave ageneral architecture for recommendation engines and tried to map our implementedrecommendation engine to this architecture. Specialty of our recommender is that it onlydepends on the implicit feedbacks of the users which are gathered through the web logs.Besides that it incorporated contextual information into the recommendation process. Manyof the traditional recommenders based on the explicit feedback of the users; however inmany cases users are reluctant against giving explicit feedbacks such as rating; thereforewe want to solve this problem by making recommendations based on the navigationbehavior of the users which is learned through the web logs.

Health-Related Rumour Detection On Twitter,Rosa Sicilia; Stella Lo Giudice; Yulong Pei; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Paolo Soda,Abstract—In the last years social networks have emerged as a critical mean for informationspreading. In spite of all the positive consequences this phenomenon brings; unverified andinstrumentally relevant information statements in circulation; named as rumours; arebecoming a potential threat to the society. Recently; there have been several studies ontopic-independent rumour detection on Twitter. In this paper we present a novel rumourdetection system which focuses on a specific topic; that is health-related rumours on Twitter.To this aim; we constructed a new subset of features including influence potential andnetwork characteristics features. We tested our approach on a real dataset observingpromising results; as it is able to correctly detect about 89% of rumours; with acceptablelevels of precision.,2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),2017,*
Apriori Versions Based on MapReduce for Mining Frequent Patterns on Big Data,José María Luna; Francisco Padillo; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Sebastián Ventura,Pattern mining is one of the most important tasks to extract meaningful and usefulinformation from raw data. This task aims to extract item-sets that represent any type ofhomogeneity and regularity in data. Although many efficient algorithms have beendeveloped in this regard; the growing interest in data has caused the performance ofexisting pattern mining techniques to be dropped. The goal of this paper is to propose newefficient pattern mining algorithms to work in big data. To this aim; a series of algorithmsbased on the MapReduce framework and the Hadoop open-source implementation havebeen proposed. The proposed algorithms can be divided into three main groups. First; twoalgorithms [Apriori MapReduce (AprioriMR) and iterative AprioriMR] with no pruning strategyare proposed; which extract any existing item-set in data.

Mining Context-Aware Association Rules Using Grammar-Based Genetic Programming,José María Luna; Mykola Pechenizkiy; María José del Jesus; Sebastián Ventura,Real-world data usually comprise features whose interpretation depends on somecontextual information. Such contextual-sensitive features and patterns are of high interest tobe discovered and analyzed in order to obtain the right meaning. This paper formulates theproblem of mining context-aware association rules; which refers to the search forassociations between itemsets such that the strength of their implication depends on acontextual feature. For the discovery of this type of associations; a model that restricts thesearch space and includes syntax constraints by means of a grammar-based geneticprogramming methodology is proposed. Grammars can be considered as a useful way ofintroducing subjective knowledge to the pattern mining process as they are highly related tothe background knowledge of the user.

Have It Both Ways—From A/B Testing to A&B Testing with Exceptional Model Mining,Wouter Duivesteijn; Tara Farzami; Thijs Putman; Evertjan Peer; Hilde JP Weerts; Jasper N Adegeest; Gerson Foks; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract In traditional A/B testing; we have two variants of the same product; a pool of testsubjects; and a measure of success. In a randomized experiment; each test subject ispresented with one of the two variants; and the measure of success is aggregated pervariant. The variant of the product associated with the most success is retained; while theother variant is discarded. This; however; presumes that the company producing theproducts only has enough capacity to maintain one of the two product variants. If morecapacity is available; then advanced data science techniques can extract more profit for thecompany from the A/B testing results. Exceptional Model Mining is one such advanced datascience technique; which specializes in identifying subgroups that behave differently fromthe overall population.

Structural measures of clustering quality on graph samples,GHL Fletcher; J Zhang; Y Pei; M Pechenizkiy,Abstract Due to the growing presence of large-scale and streaming graphs such as socialnetworks; graph sampling and clustering play an important role in many real-worldapplications. One key aspect of graph clustering is the evaluation of cluster quality.However; little attention has been paid to evaluation measures for clustering quality onsamples of graphs. As first steps towards appropriate evaluation of clustering methods onsampled graphs; in this work we present two novel evaluation measures for graph clusteringcalled δ-precision and δ-recall. These measures effectively reflect the match quality of theclusters in the sampled graph with respect to the ground-truth clusters in the original graph.We show in extensive experiments on various benchmarks that our proposed metrics arepractical and effective for graph clustering evaluation.< br/>,*,2016,*

Identifying regrettable messages on social networks,SPG Patelski; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Aristides Gionis; George Fletcher; Dragan Bosnacki,Abstract The things you post on the internet can stay there for years; or maybe even forever.People often forget that their posts on online social networks can be read by more peoplethan they think. Even things that are posted privately to a group of friends may leak to alarger audience when the post is spread further by one of the friends. According to onestudy; 41% of Twitter users regret placing certain tweets. When such a tweet is posted; only11% realizes immediately after posting that it was a mistake. This may cause harm to theircareers or relationships. Therefore it is reasonable to say that social network users coulduse a little help with determining what to show on the social network.

Schema mapping illustration using universal examples,FN Flavius Butnariu,Abstract Data exchange is the problem of transforming data from a source database intodata that adheres to the schema of a target database. This transformation is formallycaptured by a schema mapping; which consists of a set of rules that precisely establish therelationship between the source and target database schemas. Here the rules in questionare source-to-target tuple generating dependencies (st tgds); and the focus is on classes ofst tgds such as LAV; strict LAV; n-modular; and self-join-free on the source. Schemamappings intended for realistic databases can be intricate and therefore difficult tounderstand; but data examples have emerged as a promising means to facilitate schemamapping understanding.

Towards the stress analytics framework: Managing; mining; and visualizing multi-modal data for stress awareness,Hindra Kurniawan; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Stress is experienced by many people on daily basis. Often it remains to be unrecognizedand unnoticed. We propose a framework for stress analytics and describe technologiesfacilitating management and exploration of multi-modal affective data captured inphysiological signals; such as galvanic skin response and heart rate; as well as in facialexpression; in speech and in written text. We envision that stress analytics can become auseful tool as for individual personal use for stress-awareness as for researchers aiming tostudy the phenomenon of stress.,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2014 IEEE 27th International Symposium on,2014,*
Hunting the Unknown,Elisa Constante; Jeremy den Hartog; M Petkovic; Sandro Etalle; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Data leakage causes significant losses and privacy breaches worldwide. In thispaper we present a white-box data leakage detection system to spot anomalies in databasetransactions. We argue that our approach represents a major leap forward wrt previous workbecause: i) it significantly decreases the False Positive Rate (FPR) while keeping theDetection Rate (DR) high; on our experimental dataset; consisting of millions of realenterprise transactions; we measure a FPR that is orders of magnitude lower than in state-of-the-art comparable approaches; and ii) the white-box approach allows the creation of self-explanatory and easy to update profiles able to explain why a given query is anomalous;which further boosts the practical applicability of the system.,*,2014,*
Predictive user modeling with actionable attributes,Indre Zliobaite; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract: Different machine learning techniques have been proposed and used for modelingindividual and group user needs; interests and preferences. In the traditional predictivemodeling instances are described by observable variables; called attributes. The goal is tolearn a model for predicting the target variable for unseen instances. For example; formarketing purposes a company consider profiling a new user based on her observed webbrowsing behavior; referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real worldapplications the values of some attributes are not only observable; but can be activelydecided by a decision maker. Furthermore; in some of such applications the decision makeris interested not only to generate accurate predictions; but to maximize the probability of thedesired outcome. For example; a direct marketing manager can choose which type of a …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6558,2013,*
Machine learning framework for Bayesian signal processing,Timur Bagautdinov; B de Vries; M Pechenizkiy,Abstract In this thesis; we present a Bayesian machine learning framework for signalprocessing; based on variational message passing. The developed framework and its open-source software implementation allow building generative models using a set of buildingblocks; and doing inference on them using variational message passing. The capabilities ofthe framework are being demonstrated on several applications; such as speech denoisingand image segmentation. The main contribution of this work is the newly developedframework that incorporates means for model specification; probabilistic inference andmodel comparison; and focuses on solving signal processing tasks. The framework iscapable of working with multivariate continuous data; and is expandable enough to solvecomplex real-world problems.,*,2013,*

Techniques for discrimination-free predictive models (Chapter 12),F Kamiran; TGK Calders; M Pechenizkiy,Abstract In this chapter; we give an overview of the techniques developed ourselves forconstructing discrimination-free classifiers. In discrimination-free classification the goal is tolearn a predictive model that classifies future data objects as accurately as possible; yet thepredicted labels should be uncorrelated to a given sensitive attribute. For example; the taskcould be to learn a gender-neutral model that predicts whether a potential client of a bankhas a high income or not. The techniques we developed for discrimination-awareclassification can be divided into three categories:(1) removing the discrimination directlyfrom the historical dataset before an off-the-shelf classification technique is applied;(2)changing the learning procedures themselves by restricting the search space to non-discriminatory models; and (3) adjusting the discriminatory models; learnt by off-the-shelf …,*,2013,*

Stress analytics in education (Poster),RD Kocielnik; M Pechenizkiy; N Sidorova,Abstract During the years of college and university education students are exposed todifferent kinds of stress; especially during the difficult studying periods like final examsweeks or project deadlines. Stress on a long run is dangerous and can contribute to illnessthrough its physiological effects or maladaptive health behaviors. Many students admit; orare self-aware; that they become stressed under different circumstances and have someclues about their potential stressor. Still; even for such students; the monitoring andawareness of stress are not systematic and based on subjective data; ie someone's feelings.In our work we aim at providing means to students to become aware of the past; current andexpected (objectively measured) stress and its correlation with their performance; tounderstand their stressors; to cope with and prevent stress-thus; to live healthier and …,*,2012,*

In predictive analytics; machinelearning and data mining the phenomenon of unexpected change in underlying data overtime is known as concept drift. Changes in underlying data might occur due to changingpersonal interests; changes in population; adversary activities or they can be attributed to acomplex nature of the environment. When there is a shift in data; the predictions mightbecome less accurate as the time passes or opportunities to improve the accuracy might bemissed. Thus the learning models need to be adaptive to the changes. The problem ofconcept drift is of increasing importance to machine learning and data mining as more andmore data is organized in the form of data streams rather than static databases; and it israther unusual that concepts and data distributions stay stable over a long period of time …,*,2010,*

Proposal for a Possible Solution to Spam for the Session Initiation Protocol,Jurgen Voorneveld; P de Bra; JI den Hartog; M Pechenizkiy,This thesis proposes a possible solution to spam in the SIP Voice over IP protocol. The initialthesis subject was simply to determine to what degree VoIP was susceptible to spamming orwhether it had some form of security that would make the problem less serious than e-mailspam. The thesis would describe the various solutions to spam and their advantages anddisadvantages and explain why the security did or did not work. During the course of thework it became clear that VoIP does not have any innate security and that all the knowncountermeasures to spam were ineffective.

Effectiveness of local feature selection in ensemble learning for prediction of antimicrobial resistance,Seppo Puuronen; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Alexey Tsymbal,In the real world concepts are often not stable but change over time. A typical example of thisin the biomedical context is antibiotic resistance; where pathogen sensitivity may changeover time as pathogen strains develop resistance to antibiotics that were previously effective.This problem; known as concept drift (CD); complicates the task of learning a robust model.Different Ensemble Learning (EL) approaches (that instead of learning a single classifier tryto learn and maintain a set of classifiers over time) have been shown to perform reasonablywell in the presence of concept drift. In this paper we study how much local feature selection(FS) can improve ensemble performance for data with concept drift. Our results show that FSmay improve the performance of different EL strategies; yet being more important for EL withstatic integration of classifiers like (weighted) voting. Further; the improvement of EL due …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2008. CBMS'08. 21st IEEE International Symposium on,2008,*

Using Cellular Automata for feature construction-preliminary study,Matej Mertik; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Gregor Stiglic; Peter Kokol,When first faced with a learning task; it is often not clear what a good representation of thetraining data should look like. We are often forced to create some set of features that appearplausible; without any strong confidence that they will yield superior learning. Beside; weoften do not have any prior knowledge of what learning method is the best to apply; and thusoften try multiple methods in an attempt to find the one that performs best. This paperdescribes a new method and its preliminary study for constructing features based on cellularautomata (CA). Our approach uses self-organisation ability of cellular automata byconstructing features being most efficient for making predictions. We present and comparethe CA approach with standard genetic algorithm (GA) which both use genetic programming(GP) for constructing the features.

Conflict Management in Multi-model Adaptive Hypermedia,Luis Francisco-Revilla; Frank Shipman,Abstract New adaptive hypermedia systems are employing multiple independent models inorder to better guide their adaptation mechanisms by considering relevant factors in additionto user characteristics. This approach promises an enhanced system responsiveness andfunctionality. However; it also entails the possibility of conflicts as different models cansuggest adapting the document in contradicting ways. Finding mechanisms capable ofautomatically managing these conflicts is a key issue in the development of this newgeneration of adaptive hypermedia systems.

In the real world concepts are often not stable but change with time. A typicalexample of this in the medical context is antibiotic resistance; where pathogen sensitivitymay change over time as new pathogen strains develop resistance to antibiotics which werepreviously effective. This problem; known as concept drift; complicates the task of learning amodel from medical data and requires special approaches; different from commonly usedtechniques; which treat arriving instances as equally important contributors to the finalconcept. The underlying data distribution may change as well; making previously builtmodels useless; which is known as virtual concept drift. These changes make regularupdates of the model necessary.

COST SENSITIVE MODEL SELECTION FOR FOOD SALES PREDICTION,S Vasanthapriyan,Abstract The ability to forecast consumer demand accurately is of great importance tocompanies like food sales retail and whole sales. These companies are very interested inthe most accurate way to predict the sales of especially short shelf life products andseasonal products. Bad predictions often lead to a stock shortage at the start of the seasonand rest stock at the end of the season; causing additional costs. Thus; both shortage andsurplus of goods can lead to loss of income for the company. In the current evaluationmethods these costs are not taken into consideration. In this paper; we use a cost function tofind these associated costs. We use these costs as an input to the ensemble of learnerswhich employs dynamic integration of classifiers to select the best model for final prediction.,*,*,*

Strict Order vs. Flexible Order Navigation in Online Testing,Ekaterina Vasilyeva; Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract. This paper presents the results of experimental studies organized during recentmidterm examinations in the form of online assessment with multiple-choice questions.Three kinds of tests were organized. In the first test the students had to answer the questionsin a strict order. In the second test students had a possibility to answer the questions in aflexible order; to revisit earlier answers and revise them as well. In the third test studentsanswered to the questions in a strict order; but received additional information about timerecommended for answering each question. Our results suggest that flexible ordernavigation helps the students to evaluate the relative difficulty of the questions and to betterdistribute the limited time they have between these questions. However; the results alsosuggest that providing the time-related recommendations in a test with a strict order also …,*,*,*
Bridging Navigation; Search and Adaptation: from Dexter; through AHAM; to GAF,Evgeny Knutov; Paul De Bra; Mykola Pechenizkiy,ABSTRACT Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS) have long been concentrating onadaptive guidance of links between domain concepts. In this paper we first study parallelsbetween navigation and linking in hypertext on the one hand and information searching orquerying on the other hand. We show that to a large extent linking and searching can bemodeled in the same way. Secondly we present a transition towards search in AHS byaligning the web search process with the layered structure of AHS and link adaptationprocess.,*,*,*
Sharing within the mobile world using Web technologies,Frank Buijze; GJPM Houben; PME De Bra; M Pechenizkiy,Mobile phones are becoming more and more a platform for services. Think of services forsending MMS and SMS messages or more sophisticated services such asvideoconferencing; mobile TV or payment services; for example for paying our parking ticketby using the mobile phone. Note that service concepts supporting information sharing withinthe mobile domain are not widely present; despite all the information that is residing onmobile phones such as photos; music; travel information; etc. The apparent lack of such aservice is suprising; having in mind the popularity of information sharing services on theInternet.,*,*,*
