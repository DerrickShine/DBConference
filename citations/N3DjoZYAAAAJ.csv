A generic framework for monitoring continuous spatial queries over moving objects,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract This paper proposes a generic framework for monitoring continuous spatial queriesover moving objects. The framework distinguishes itself from existing work by being the firstto address the location update issue and to provide a common interface for monitoringmixed types of queries. Based on the notion of safe region; the client location updatestrategy is developed based on the queries being monitored. Thus; it significantly reducesthe wireless communication and query reevaluation costs required to maintain the up-to-date query results. We propose algorithms for query evaluation/reevaluation and for saferegion computation in this framework. Enhancements are also proposed to take advantageof two practical mobility assumptions: maximum speed and steady movement. Theexperimental results show that our framework substantially outperforms the traditional …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,336
Processing private queries over untrusted data cloud through privacy homomorphism,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Chushi Ren; Byron Choi,Query processing that preserves both the data privacy of the owner and the query privacy ofthe client is a new research problem. It shows increasing importance as cloud computingdrives more businesses to outsource their data and querying services. However; mostexisting studies; including those on data outsourcing; address the data privacy and queryprivacy separately and cannot be applied to this problem. In this paper; we propose aholistic and efficient solution that comprises a secure traversal framework and an encryptionscheme based on privacy homomorphism. The framework is scalable to large datasets byleveraging an index-based approach. Based on this framework; we devise secure protocolsfor processing typical queries such as k-nearest-neighbor queries (kNN) on R-tree index.Moreover; several optimization techniques are presented to improve the efficiency of the …,2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on Data Engineering,2011,188
Range nearest-neighbor query,Haibo Hu; Dik Lun Lee,A range nearest-neighbor (RNN) query retrieves the nearest neighbor (NN) for every point ina range. It is a natural generalization of point and continuous nearest-neighbor queries andhas many applications. In this paper; we consider the ranges as (hyper) rectangles andpropose efficient in-memory processing and secondary memory pruning techniques for RNNqueries in both 2D and high-dimensional spaces. These techniques are generalized forkRNN queries; which return the k nearest neighbors for every point in the range. In addition;we devise an auxiliary solution-based index EXO-tree to speed up any type of NN query.EXO-tree is orthogonal to any existing NN processing algorithm and; thus; can betransparently integrated. An extensive empirical study was conducted to evaluate the CPUand I/O performance of these techniques; and the study showed that they are efficient and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,153
Privacy-conscious location-based queries in mobile environments,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Haibo Hu; Jing Du,In location-based services; users with location-aware mobile devices are able to makequeries about their surroundings anywhere and at any time. While this ubiquitous computingparadigm brings great convenience for information access; it also raises concerns overpotential intrusion into user location privacy. To protect location privacy; one typicalapproach is to cloak user locations into spatial regions based on user-specified privacyrequirements; and to transform location-based queries into region-based queries. In thispaper; we identify and address three new issues concerning this location cloakingapproach. First; we study the representation of cloaking regions and show that a circularregion generally leads to a small result size for region-based queries. Second; we develop amobility-aware location cloaking technique to resist trace analysis attacks. Two cloaking …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,112
Distance indexing on road networks,Haibo Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Victor Lee,Abstract The processing of kNN and continuous kNN queries on spatial network databases(SNDB) has been intensively studied recently. However; there is a lack of systematic studyon the computation of network distances; which is the most fundamental difference betweena road network and a Euclidean space. Since the online Dijkstra's algorithm has beenshown to be efficient only for short distances; we propose an efficient index; called distancesignature; for distance computation and query processing over long distances. Distancesignature discretizes the distances between objects and network nodes into categories andthen encodes these categories. To minimize the storage and search costs; we present theoptimal category partition; and the encoding and compression algorithms for the signatures;based on a simplified network topology. By mathematical analysis and experimental …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,111
Semantic location modeling for location navigation in mobile environment,Haibo Hu; Dik-Lun Lee,Location-based applications require a well-formed representation of spatial knowledge.Current location models can be classified into symbolic or geometric models. The formerattempts to represent logical entities and their semantics; but requires a large amount ofmanual effort for describing them. On the other hand; the latter represents the geometriccoordinates but not the semantics. In this paper; we present a semantic location modelwhich preserves topology and distance semantics to support location navigation but at thesame time facilitates programmatic model construction and maintenance. The model isbased on a sound location theory. It is mainly composed of two hierarchies: a locationhierarchy and an exit hierarchy; which can be derived from spatial maps; such as floor plans;without manual intervention. Through a series of model construction algorithms and a real …,Mobile Data Management; 2004. Proceedings. 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,107
Fast nearest neighbor search on road networks,Haibo Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries have been extended from Euclidean spaces to roadnetworks. Existing approaches are either based on Dijkstra-like network expansion orNN/distance precomputation. The former may cause an explosive number of node accessesfor sparse datasets because all nodes closer than the NN to the query must be visited. Thelatter; eg; the Voronoi Network Nearest Neighbor (VN 3) approach; can handle sparsedatasets but is inappropriate for medium and dense datasets due to its high precomputationand storage overhead. In this paper; we propose a new approach that indexes the networktopology based on a novel network reduction technique. It simplifies the network byreplacing the graph topology with a set of interconnected tree-based structures calledSPIE's. An nd index is developed for each SPIE and our new (k) NN search algorithms on …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,98
Non-exposure location anonymity,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Location cloaking has been proposed and well studied to protect user privacy. It blurs theaccurate user location (ie; a point withcoordinates) and replaces it with a well-shapedcloaked region (usually a circle or a rectangle). However; to obtain such a cloaked region;all existing cloaking algorithms require to know the accurate locations of all users. Sincesuch information is exactly what the user wants to hide; these algorithms can work only if allparties involved in the cloaking process are trusted. However; in practice this assumptionrarely holds as any of these parties could be malicious. Therefore; location cloaking withoutexposing the accurate user location to any party is urgently needed. In this paper; wepresent such a non-exposure cloaking algorithm. It is designed for k-anonymity and cloakingis performed based on the proximity information among mobile users; instead of directly …,2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering,2009,85
Proactive caching for spatial queries in mobile environments,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Wing Sing Wong; Baihua Zheng; Dik Lun Lee; W-C Lee,Semantic caching enables mobile clients to answer spatial queries locally by storing thequery descriptions together with the results. However; it supports only a limited number ofquery types; and sharing results among these types is difficult. To address these issues; wepropose a proactive caching model which caches the result objects as well as the index thatsupports these objects as the results. The cached index enables the objects to be reused forall common types of queries. We also propose an adaptive scheme to cache such an index;which further optimizes the query response time for the best user experience. Simulationresults show that proactive caching achieves a significant performance gain over pagecaching and semantic caching in mobile environments where wireless bandwidth andbattery are precious resources.,21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'05),2005,75
When location-based services meet databases,Dik Lun Lee; Manli Zhu; Haibo Hu,Abstract As location-based services (LBSs) grow to support a larger and larger usercommunity and to provide more and more intelligent services; they must face a fewfundamental challenges; including the ability to not only accept coordinates as location databut also manipulate high-level semantics of the physical environment. They must alsohandle a large amount of location updates and client requests and be able to scale up astheir coverage increases. This paper describes some of our research in location modelingand updates and techniques for enhancing system performance by caching and batchprocessing. It can be observed that the challenges facing LBSs share a lot of similarity withtraditional database research (ie; data modeling; indexing; caching; and query optimization)but the fact that LBSs are built into the physical space and the opportunity to exploit …,Mobile Information Systems,2005,55
You can walk alone: trajectory privacy-preserving through significant stays protection,Zheng Huo; Xiaofeng Meng; Haibo Hu; Yi Huang,Abstract Publication of moving objects' everyday life trajectories may cause serious personalprivacy leakage. Existing trajectory privacy-preserving methods try to anonymize k wholetrajectories together; which may result in complicated algorithms and extra information loss.We observe that; background information are more relevant to where the moving objectsreally visit rather than where they just pass by. In this paper; we propose an approach calledY ou C an W alk A lone (YCWA) to protect trajectory privacy through generalization of staypoints on trajectories. By protecting stay points; sensitive information is protected; while theprobability of whole trajectories' exposure is reduced. Moreover; the information loss causedby the privacy-preserving process is reduced. To the best of our knowledge; this is the firstresearch that protects trajectory privacy through protecting significant stays or similar …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,53
Authenticating location-based services without compromising location privacy,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Qian Chen; Ziwei Yang,Abstract The popularity of mobile social networking services (mSNSs) is propelling moreand more businesses; especially those in retailing and marketing; into mobile and location-based forms. To address the trust issue; the service providers are expected to deliver theirlocation-based services in an authenticatable manner; so that the correctness of the serviceresults can be verified by the client. However; existing works on query authentication cannotpreserve the privacy of the data being queried; which are sensitive user locations when itcomes to location-based services and mSNSs. In this paper; we address this challengingproblem by proposing a comprehensive solution that preserves unconditional locationprivacy when authenticating range queries. Three authentication schemes for $ R $-tree andgrid-file index; together with two optimization techniques; are developed.

Privacy-aware location data publishing,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Sai Tung On; Jing Du; Joseph Kee-Yin Ng,Abstract This article examines a new problem of k-anonymity with respect to a referencedataset in privacy-aware location data publishing: given a user dataset and a sensitive eventdataset; we want to generalize the user dataset such that by joining it with the event datasetthrough location; each event is covered by at least k users. Existing k-anonymity algorithmsgeneralize every k user locations to the same vague value; regardless of the events.Therefore; they tend to overprotect against the privacy compromise and make the publisheddata less useful. In this article; we propose a new generalization paradigm called localenlargement; as opposed to conventional hierarchy-or partition-based generalization. Localenlargement guarantees that user locations are enlarged just enough to cover all events ktimes; and thus maximize the usefulness of the published data.

PAM: an efficient and privacy-aware monitoring framework for continuously moving objects,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Efficiency and privacy are two fundamental issues in moving object monitoring. This paperproposes a privacy-aware monitoring (PAM) framework that addresses both issues. Theframework distinguishes itself from the existing work by being the first to holistically addressthe issues of location updating in terms of monitoring accuracy; efficiency; and privacy;particularly; when and how mobile clients should send location updates to the server. Basedon the notions of safe region and most probable result; PAM performs location updates onlywhen they would likely alter the query results. Furthermore; by designing various clientupdate strategies; the framework is flexible and able to optimize accuracy; privacy; orefficiency. We develop efficient query evaluation/reevaluation and safe region computationalgorithms in the framework. The experimental results show that PAM substantially …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2010,44
Nearby friend alert: Location anonymity in mobile geosocial networks,Hong Ping Li; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Mobile geosocial networking services could be the killer app for next-generation mobilecomputing. However; the privacy issue--in particular; location privacy--has both users andgovernment authors concerned. The authors address this issue for the" nearby friend alert"service; common in mobile geosocial networks. They review representative works on privacy-preserving proximity detection and present a new quantitative solution. They adopt the grid-and-hashing paradigm and develop optimal grid overlay and multilevel grids to increase thedetection accuracy while saving the wireless bandwidth. Based on these techniques; theydevise the client-side location update scheme and the server-side update handlingprocedure for continuous proximity detection. Simulation results show that their approach isefficient and scalable under various system parameters and user moving speeds.,IEEE Pervasive Computing,2013,40
PCMLogging: reducing transaction logging overhead with PCM,Shen Gao; Jianliang Xu; Bingsheng He; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Abstract Phase Changing Memory (PCM); as one of the most promising next-generationmemory technologies; offers various attractive properties such as non-volatility; bit-alterability; and low idle energy consumption. In this paper; we present PCMLogging; anovel logging scheme that exploits PCM devices for both data buffering and transactionlogging in disk-based databases. Different from the traditional approach where bufferedupdates and transaction logs are completely separated; they are integrated in the newlogging scheme. Our preliminary experiments show an up to 40% improvement ofPCMLogging in disk I/O performance in comparison with a basic buffering and loggingscheme.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,39
Range-based skyline queries in mobile environments,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Skyline query processing for location-based services; which considers both spatial andnonspatial attributes of the objects being queried; has recently received increasing attention.Existing solutions focus on solving point-or line-based skyline queries; in which the querylocation is an exact location point or a line segment. However; due to privacy concerns andlimited precision of localization devices; the input of a user location is often a spatial range.This paper studies a new problem of how to process such range-based skyline queries. Twonovel algorithms are proposed: one is index-based (I-SKY) and the other is not based onany index (N-SKY). To handle frequent movements of the objects being queried; we alsopropose incremental versions of I-SKY and N-SKY; which avoid recomputing the queryindex and results from scratch. Additionally; we develop efficient solutions for probabilistic …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,36
2PASS: Bandwidth-optimized location cloaking for anonymous location-based services,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Protection of users' location privacy is a critical issue for location-based services. Locationcloaking has been proposed to blur users' accurate locations with cloaked regions. Althoughvarious cloaking algorithms have been studied; none of the prior work has explored theimpact of cloaking on the bandwidth usage of requested services. In this paper; we developan innovative result-aware location cloaking approach; called 2PASS. Based on the notionof Voronoi cells; 2PASS minimizes the number of objects to request; and hence; thebandwidth while meeting the same privacy requirement. The core component of 2PASS is alightweight WAG-tree index; based on which efficient and secure client and serverprocedures are designed. Through threat analysis and experimental results; we argue that2PASS is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various metrics …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,34
DigestJoin: Exploiting fast random reads for flash-based joins,Yu Li; Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Flash disks have been an emerging secondary storage media. In particular; there have beenportable devices; multimedia players and laptop computers that are configured with nomagnetic disks but flash disks. It is envisioned that some RDBMSs will operate on flash disksin the near future. However; the I/O characteristics of flash disks are different from those ofmagnetic disks. Thus; in this paper; we study the core of query processing in RDBMSs---joinprocessing---on flash disks. Specifically; we propose a new join method; called DigestJoin;to exploit fast random reads of flashdisks. DigestJoin consists of two phases:(1) projectingthe join attributes followed by a join on the projected attributes; and (2) fetching the fulltuples that satisfy the join to produce the final join results. While the problem of tuple/pagefetching with minimum I/O cost (in the second phase) is intractable; we propose three …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Adaptive realtime bandwidth allocation for wireless data delivery,Chi-Wai Lin; Haibo Hu; Dik-Lun Lee,Abstract The combination of broadcast and on-demand data delivery services is aneconomic way to build a highly scalable wireless information system with limited bandwidth.The use of data broadcasting should be adaptive so that the system response time canalways be minimized. A traditional approach requires the development of a system responsetime equation in order to find the optimal solution. However; obtaining such an equation isnot always possible. We observe that by maintaining a certain level of on-demand requestarrival rate; a close approximation to the optimal solution can be obtained. Using thisapproach; a real-time adaptive data delivery algorithm is developed. Our algorithm does notrequire the access information of the data items to be known exactly; which is needednormally for this kind of optimization problems.

Answering why-not questions on spatial keyword top-k queries,Lei Chen; Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Christian S Jensen; Jianliang Xu,Large volumes of geo-tagged text objects are available on the web. Spatial keyword top-kqueries retrieve k such objects with the best score according to a ranking function that takesinto account a query location and query keywords. In this setting; users may wonder whysome known object is unexpectedly missing from a result; and understanding why may aidusers in retrieving better results. While spatial keyword querying has been studiedintensively; no proposals exist for how to offer users explanations of why such expectedobjects are missing from results. We provide techniques that allow the revision of spatialkeyword queries such that their results include one or more desired; but missing objects. Indoing so; we adopt a query refinement approach to provide a basic algorithm that reducesthe problem to a two-dimensional geometrical problem.

Authenticating top-k queries in location-based services with confidentiality,Qian Chen; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract State-of-the-art location-based services (LBSs) involve data owners; requestingclients; and service providers. As LBSs become new business opportunities; there is anincreasing necessity to verify the genuineness of service results. Unfortunately; whiletraditional query authentication techniques can address this issue; they fail to protect theconfidentiality of data; which is sensitive location information when LBSs are concerned.Recent work has studied how to preserve such location privacy in query authentication.However; the prior work is limited to range queries; where private values only appear on oneside of the range comparison. In this paper; we address the more challenging authenticationproblem on top-k queries; where private values appear on both sides of a comparison.

Lazy-update b+-tree for flash devices,Sai Tung On; Haibo Hu; Yu Li; Jianliang Xu,With the rapid increasing capacity of flash chips; flash-aware indexing techniques are highlydesirable for flash devices. The unique features of flash memory; such as the erase-before-write constraint and the asymmetric read/write cost; severely deteriorate the performance ofthe traditional B+-tree algorithm. In this paper; we propose a new indexing method; calledlazy-update B+-tree; to overcome the limitations of flash memory. The basic idea is to deferthe time of committing update requests to the B+-tree by buffering them in a segment of mainmemory. They are later committed in groups so that each write operation can be amortizedby a bunch of update requests. We identify a victim selection problem for the lazy-update B+-tree and develop two heuristic-based commit policies to address the problem.

Authentication of location-based skyline queries,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Abstract In outsourced spatial databases; the location-based service (LBS) provides queryservices to the clients on behalf of the data owner. However; if the LBS is not trustworthy; itmay return incorrect or incomplete query results. Thus; authentication is needed to verify thesoundness and completeness of query results. In this paper; we study the authenticationproblem for location-based skyline queries; which have recently been receiving increasingattention in LBS applications. We propose two authentication methods: one based on thetraditional MR-tree index and the other based on a newly developed MR-Sky-tree.Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods in terms of theauthentication cost.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,27
Clustering moving objects in spatial networks,Jidong Chen; Caifeng Lai; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Abstract Advances in wireless networks and positioning technologies (eg; GPS) haveenabled new data management applications that monitor moving objects. In such newapplications; realtime data analysis such as clustering analysis is becoming one of the mostimportant requirements. In this paper; we present the problem of clustering moving objects inspatial networks and propose a unified framework to address this problem. Due to the innatefeature of continuously changing positions of moving objects; the clustering resultsdynamically change. By exploiting the unique features of road networks; our framework firstintroduces a notion of cluster block (CB) as the underlying clustering unit. We then divide theclustering process into the continuous maintenance of CBs and periodical construction ofclusters with different criteria based on CBs.

Flag commit: Supporting efficient transaction recovery in flash-based dbmss,Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu; Bingsheng He,Owing to recent advances in semiconductor technologies; flash disks have been acompetitive alternative to traditional magnetic disks as external storage media. In this paper;we study how transaction recovery can be efficiently supported in database managementsystems (dbmss) running on slc flash disks. Inspired by the classical shadow-pagingapproach; we propose a new commit scheme; called flagcommit; to exploit the uniquecharacteristics of flash disks such as fast random read access; out-place updating; andpartial page programming. To minimize the need of writing log records; we embed thetransaction status into flash pages through a chain of commit flags. Based on flagcommit; wedevelop two recovery protocols; namely commit-based flag commit (cfc) and abort-basedflag commit (afc); to meet different performance needs.

The iPDA system consists of three main components: 1) amobility-aware location cloaker that cloaks the user's location with a region and transforms alocation-based query to a region-based query; 2) a progressive query processor thatefficiently evaluates a result superset for the location-based query and; 3) a result refiner thatrefines the superset to generate the exact query result for the user.

Authenticating location-based skyline queries in arbitrary subspaces,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Wang-Chien Lee,With the ever-increasing use of smartphones and tablet devices; location-based services(LBSs) have experienced explosive growth in the past few years. To scale up services; therehas been a rising trend of outsourcing data management to Cloud service providers; whichprovide query services to clients on behalf of data owners. However; in this data-outsourcingmodel; the service provider can be untrustworthy or compromised; thereby returningincorrect or incomplete query results to clients; intentionally or not. Therefore; empoweringclients to authenticate query results is imperative for outsourced databases. In this paper; westudy the authentication problem for location-based arbitrary-subspace skyline queries(LASQs); which represent an important class of LBS applications.

Private search on key-value stores with hierarchical indexes,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xizhong Xu; Kexin Pei; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Query processing that preserves both the query privacy at the client and the data privacy atthe server is a new research problem. It has many practical applications; especially whenthe queries are about the sensitive attributes of records. However; most existing studies;including those originating from data outsourcing; address the data privacy and queryprivacy separately. Although secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a suitable computingparadigm for this problem; it has significant computation and communication overheads;thus unable to scale up to large datasets. Fortunately; recent advances in cryptography bringus two relevant tools-conditional oblivious transfer and homomorphic encryption. In thispaper; we integrate database indexing techniques with these tools in the context of privatesearch on key-value stores.

VERDICT: Privacy-preserving authentication of range queries in location-based services,Haibo Hu; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu,We demonstrate VERDICT; a location-based range query service featuring the privacy-preserving authentication capability. VERDICT adopts the common data-as-a-service(DaaS) model; which consists of the data owner (a location registry or a mobile operator)who provides the querying data; the service provider who executes the query; and thequerying users. The system features a privacy-preserving query authentication module thatenables the user to verify the correctness of results while still protecting the data privacy.This feature is crucial in many location-based services where the querying data are userlocations. To achieve this; VERDICT employs an MR-tree based privacy-preservingauthentication scheme proposed in our earlier work [3].

StableBuffer: optimizing write performance for DBMS applications on flash devices,Yu Li; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Abstract Flash devices have been widely used in embedded systems; laptop computers; andenterprise servers. However; the poor random writes have been an obstacle to running write-intensive DBMS applications on flash devices. In this paper; we exploit the recentlydiscovered; efficient write patterns of flash devices to optimize the performance of DBMSapplications. Specifically; motivated by a focused write pattern; we propose to write pagestemporarily to a small; pre-allocated storage space on the flash device; called StableBuffer;instead of directly writing to their actual destinations. We then recognize and flush efficientwrite patterns of the buffer to achieve a better write performance. In contrast to prior log-based techniques; our StableBuffer solution does not require modifying the driver of flashdevices and hence works well for commodity flash devices.

Corrupted and occluded face recognition via cooperative sparse representation,Zhong-Qiu Zhao; Yiu-ming Cheung; Haibo Hu; Xindong Wu,Abstract In image classification; can sparse representation (SR) associate one test imagewith all training ones from the correct class; but not associate with any training ones from theincorrect classes? The backward sparse representation (bSR) which containscomplementary information in an opposite direction can remedy the imperfect associationsdiscovered by the general forward sparse representation (fSR). Unfortunately; thiscomplementarity between the fSR and the bSR has not been studied in face recognition.There are two key problems to be solved. One is how to produce additional bases for thebSR. In face recognition; there is no other bases than the single test face image itself for thebSR; which results in large reconstruction residual and weak classification capability of thebSR. The other problem is how to deal with the robustness of the bSR to image corruption …,Pattern Recognition,2016,12

Geo-social group queries with minimum acquaintance constraints,Qijun Zhu; Haibo Hu; Cheng Xu; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract The prosperity of location-based social networking has paved the way for newapplications of group-based activity planning and marketing. While such applicationsheavily rely on geo-social group queries (GSGQs); existing studies fail to produce acohesive group in terms of user acquaintance. In this paper; we propose a new family ofGSGQs with minimum acquaintance constraints. They are more appealing to users as theyguarantee a worst-case acquaintance level in the result group. For efficient processing ofGSGQs on large location-based social networks; we devise two social-aware spatial indexstructures; namely SaR-tree and SaR*-tree. The latter improves on the former by consideringboth spatial and social distances when clustering objects. Based on SaR-tree and SaR*-tree; novel algorithms are developed to process various GSGQs.

Gamma: A framework for moving object simulation,Haibo Hu; Dik-Lun Lee,Abstract Simulating user mobility is crucial for mobile computing and spatial databaseresearch. However; all existing moving object generators assume a fixed and oftenunrealistic mobility model. In this paper; we represent the moving behavior as a trajectory inthe location-temporal space and propose two generic metrics to evaluate a trajectorydataset. In this context; trajectory generation is treated as an optimization problem and aframework; GAMMA; is proposed to solve it by the genetic algorithm. We demonstrateGAMMA's practicability and flexibility by configuring it for two specific simulations; namely;cellular network trajectory and symbolic location tracking. The experimental results showthat GAMMA can efficiently and robustly produce high quality moving object datasets forvarious simulation objectives.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,10
PrivacyPreserving Locationbased Queries in Mobile Environments,Jianliang Xu; Jing Du; Xueyan Tang; Haibo Hu,Abstract In location based services (LBS); users with locationaware mobile devices canquery their surroundings anywhere and at any time. While this ubiquitous computingparadigm brings great convenience for information access; it raises a concern of potentialintrusion on users' location privacy; which has hampered the widespread use of LBS. In thispaper; we present iPDA; a client-based framework to facilitate privacy-preserving location-based data access in mobile environments. The main idea is to reduce the resolution of userlocation based on location cloaking and transform a location-based query to a region-basedquery. We develop an optimal location cloaking technique that is immune to mobilityanalysis attack.

As the location update problem is the core of object monitoring; we develop acost model on the power consumption and propose a family of energy-efficient locationupdate schemes. In these schemes; upon each location update the server sends backadditional information about the predicates so that the client can defer the next update until itis about to change the predicate value. As a result; the updates are less frequent than thetraditional periodic or dead-reckoning schemes without undermining the monitoringaccuracy.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2005,9
Authenticated Online Data Integration Services,Qian Chen; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Data integration involves combining data from multiple sources and providing userswith a unified query interface. Data integrity has been a key problem in online dataintegration. Although a variety of techniques have been proposed to address the dataconsistency and reliability issues; there is little work on assuring the integrity of integrateddata and the correctness of query results. In this paper; we take the first step to proposeauthenticated data integration services to ensure data and query integrity even in thepresence of an untrusted integration server. We develop a novel authentication code calledhomomorphic secret sharing seal that can aggregate the inputs from individual sourcesfaithfully by the untrusted server for future query authentication. Based on this; we designtwo authenticated index structures and authentication schemes for queries on multi …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,8
Private proximity detection and monitoring with vicinity regions,Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Hong Ping Li; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Abstract Proximity detection is an important location-based service (LBS) that helps mobileusers find nearby friends. However; this service usually requires users to submit theirlocations to the server; which raises privacy concerns. In this paper; we propose symmetricproximity detection on vicinity regions as a fair and privacy-preserving solution to thisproblem. Specifically; each user can specify a nearby area as vicinity region; and two usersare considered to be in proximity only if they are located in each other's vicinity region. Toenable efficient detection; we design a shift-and-compare protocol for one-shot proximityqueries without revealing users' locations or vicinity regions. Furthermore; for continuousproximity monitoring; we propose an alert-area-based location update strategy with minimalupdate frequency; thereby saving communication cost.

Adaptive power-aware prefetching schemes for mobile broadcast environments,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Caching and prefetching are common techniques in mobile broadcastenvironments. Several prefetching policies have been proposed in the literature to eitherachieve the minimum access latency or save power as much as possible. However; littlework has been carried out to adaptively balance these two metrics in a dynamic environmentwhere the user request arrival patterns change over time. This paper investigates how bothlow latency and low power consumption can be achieved for dynamic request patterns. Twoadaptive power-aware schemes; PT with secure region (PTSR) and adaptive prefetchingwith sliding caches (APSC); are proposed. Experimental results show the proposed policies;in particular APSC; achieve a much lower power consumption while maintaining a similaraccess latency as the existing policies.,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2003,8
Optimizing Nonindexed Join Processing in Flash Storage-Based Systems,Yu Li; Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Flash memory-based disks (or simply flash disks) have been widely used in today'scomputer systems. With their continuously increasing capacity and dropping price; it isenvisioned that some database systems will operate on flash disks in the near future.However; the I/O characteristics of flash disks are different from those of magnetic hard disks.Motivated by this; we study the core of query processing in row-based database systems-join processing-on flash storage media. More specifically; we propose a new framework;called DigestJoin; to optimize nonindexed join processing by reducing the intermediateresult size and exploiting fast random reads of flash disks. DigestJoin consists of twophases: 1) projecting the join attributes followed by a join on the projected attributes; and 2)fetching the full tuples that satisfy the join to produce the final join results.

Reverse Keyword Search for Spatio-Textual Top-Queries in Location-Based Services,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Spatio-textual queries retrieve the most similar objects with respect to a given location and akeyword set. Existing studies mainly focus on how to efficiently find the top-k result set givena spatio-textual query. Nevertheless; in many application scenarios; users cannot preciselyformulate their keywords and instead prefer to choose them from some candidate keywordsets. Moreover; in information browsing applications; it is useful to highlight the objects withthe tags (keywords) under which the objects have high rankings. Driven by theseapplications; we propose a novel query paradigm; namely reverse keyword search for spatio-textual top-k queries (RSTQ). It returns the keywords under which a target object will be aspatio-textual top-k result. To efficiently process the new query; we devise a novel hybridindex KcR-tree to store and summarize the spatial and textual information of objects.

Geo-Social K-Cover Group Queries for Collaborative Spatial Computing,Yafei Li; Rui Chen; Jianliang Xu; Qiao Huang; Haibo Hu; Byron Choi,With the rapid development of location-aware mobile devices; ubiquitous Internet accessand social computing technologies; lots of users' personal information; such as location dataand social data; has been readily accessible from various mobile platforms and online socialnetworks. The convergence of these two types of data; known as geo-social data; hasenabled collaborative spatial computing that explicitly combines both location and socialfactors to answer useful geo-social queries for either business or social good. In this paper;we study a new type of Geo-Social K-Cover Group (GSKCG) queries that; given a set ofquery points and a social network; retrieves a minimum user group in which each user issocially related to at least k other users and the users' associated regions (eg; familiarregions or service regions) can jointly cover all the query points.

Energy Efficient Data Management,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang,Sensor networks have reached the stage of massive deployment for a wide range ofapplications such as ecosystem monitoring and traffic surveillance (Akyildiz et al. 2002;Szewczyk et al. 2004). A wireless sensor network typically consists of a base station(sometimes called sink; or gateway); and a set of sensor nodes (sometimes called sources;see Fig. 12.1). The sensor nodes are used to continuously capture environmental data suchas temperature; humidity; lightness; etc. To send these data back to the base station andassist message routing; they are also equipped with radio transceivers that are capable ofshort-range transmission. The base station; as observed from the figure; serves as thegateway of the sensor network to exchange data and control messages with externalapplications to accomplish certain missions.

Structure-Preserving Subgraph Query Services,Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,A fundamental problem of graph databases is subgraph isomorphism query (aka subgraphquery): given a query graph Q and a graph database; it retrieves the graphs Gs from thedatabase that contain Q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with thecomputational hardness of subgraph isomorphism testing; outsourcing the computations to athird-party provider is an appealing alternative. However; confidentiality has been a criticalattribute of quality of service (QoS) in query services. To the best of our knowledge;subgraph query services with tunable preservation of privacy of structural information havenever been addressed. In this paper; we present the first work on structure-preservingsubIso (SPsubIso).

We investigate how multiple window queries can be parallelized;decomposed; scheduled and processed in real time workloads to optimize systemperformance; such as I/O cost; response time and miss rate. We devise in-memory R-trees todecompose queries into independent jobs. Jobs from different queries can be combinedaccording to their spatial locality to eliminate redundant I/Os.

A private DNA motif finding algorithm,Rui Chen; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Abstract With the increasing availability of genomic sequence data; numerous methods havebeen proposed for finding DNA motifs. The discovery of DNA motifs serves a critical step inmany biological applications. However; the privacy implication of DNA analysis is normallyneglected in the existing methods. In this work; we propose a private DNA motif findingalgorithm in which a DNA owner's privacy is protected by a rigorous privacy model; knownas∊-differential privacy. It provides provable privacy guarantees that are independent ofadversaries' background knowledge. Our algorithm makes use of the n-gram model and isoptimized for processing large-scale DNA sequences. We evaluate the performance of ouralgorithm over real-life genomic data and demonstrate the promise of integrating privacy intoDNA motif finding.,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,4
Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor query without information leakage,Lu Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Bichromatic Reverse Nearest Neighbor (BRNN) Query is an important query type inlocation-based services (LBS) and has many real life applications; such as site selectionand resource allocation. However; such query requires the client to disclose sensitivelocation information to the LBS. The only existing method for privacy-preserving BRNNquery adopts the cloaking-region paradigm; which blurs the location into a spatial region.However; the LBS can still deduce some information (albeit not exact) about the location. Inthis paper; we aim at strong privacy wherein the LBS learns nothing about the querylocation. To this end; we employ private information retrieval (PIR) technique; whichaccesses data pages anonymously from a database. Based on PIR; we propose a securequery processing framework together with various indexing and optimization techniques …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,2
Incremental maintenance of the minimum bisimulation of cyclic graphs,Jintian Deng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,There have been numerous recent applications of graph databases (eg; the Semantic Web;ontology representation; social networks; XML; chemical databases; and biologicaldatabases). A fundamental structural index for data graphs; namely minimum bisimulation;has been reported useful for efficient path query processing and optimization includingselectivity estimation; among many others. Data graphs are subject to change and theirindexes are updated accordingly. This paper studies the incremental maintenance problemof the minimum bisimulation of a possibly cyclic data graph. While cyclic graphs areubiquitous among the data on the web; previous work on the maintenance problem hasmostly focused on acyclic graphs. To study the problem with cyclic graphs; we first show thatthe two existing classes of minimization algorithms-merging algorithm and partition …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,2
Online Learning towards Big Data Analysis in Health Informatics,Jing Wang; Zhong-Qiu Zhao; Xuegang Hu; Yiu-ming Cheung; Haibo Hu; Fangqing Gu,Abstract The exponential increase of data in health informatics has brought a lot ofchallenges in terms of data transfer; storage; computation and analysis. One of the popularsolutions to the above challenges is the cloud computing technology. However; the cloudcomputing technology requires high-performance computers and is only accessible withinternet. In this paper; we introduce online learning and propose our method for data miningof big data in health informatics. In contrast to traditional data analysis scenario; onlinelearning will preform the data analysis dynamically by the time the data are generated. Theonline learning method is efficient and especially adaptable to the online health caresystems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our online learning method on several real-world data sets.,Proceedings of the International Conference on Brain and Health Informatics-Volume 8211,2013,2
Challenges in managing and mining large; heterogeneous data,Haibo Hu; Haixun Wang; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Success in various application domains including sensor networks; social networks;and multimedia; has ushered in a new era of information explosion. Despite the diversity ofthese domains; data acquired by applications in these domains are often voluminous;heterogeneous and containing much uncertainty. They share several commoncharacteristics; which impose new challenges to storing; integrating; and processing thesedata; especially in the context of data outsourcing and cloud computing. Some challengesinclude the following. First; autonomous data acquisition gives rise to privacy and securityissues. Therefore; data management and mining must be elastic and privacy-conscious.Second; data is often dynamic and the trend in the data is often unpredictable.

Authenticating Aggregate Queries over Set-Valued Data with Confidentiality,Cheng Xu; Qian Chen; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xiaojun Hei,With recent advances in data-as-a-service (DaaS) and cloud computing; aggregate queryservices over set-valued data are becoming widely available for business intelligence thatdrives decision making. However; as the service provider is often a third-party delegate ofthe data owner; the integrity of the query results cannot be guaranteed and is thusimperative to be authenticated. Unfortunately; existing query authentication techniqueseither do not work for set-valued data or they lack data confidentiality. In this paper; wepropose authenticated aggregate queries over set-valued data that not only ensure theintegrity of query results but also preserve the confidentiality of source data. As manyaggregate queries are composed of multiset operations such as set union and subset; wefirst develop a family of privacy-preserving authentication protocols for primitive multiset …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Assuring spatio-temporal integrity on mobile devices with minimum location disclosure,Haibo Hu; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Since the boom of smartphones and location-based services; spatio-temporal data (ie; userlocations with timestamps) have become increasingly essential in many real-lifeapplications. To ensure these data are faithfully extracted from the underlying locationtracking hardware and not altered by any malicious party or the user himself/herself; integrityassurance schemes such as digital signatures or message authentication codes (MAC) mustbe adopted. However; these conventional schemes disclose to the verifier the completeplaintext location and thus jeopardize users' privacy. In this paper; we propose an integrityassurance scheme with minimum location disclosure. That is; the granule of the disclosedlocation is just small enough to prove the user is/has been to a certain place; and the verifiercannot learn anything beyond it. To this end; we propose a new MAC scheme called …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2017,1
Expanding dictionary for robust face recognition: pixel is not necessary while sparsity is,Zhong-Qiu Zhao; Yiu-ming Cheung; Haibo Hu; Xindong Wu,Since sparse representation (SR) was first introduced into robust face recognition; theargument has lasted for several years about whether sparsity can improve robust facerecognition or not. Some work argued that the robust sparse representation (RSR) modelhas a similar recognition rate as non-sparse solution; while it needs a much highercomputational cost due to the larger feature dimensionality in the pixel space. In this study;the authors reveal that the standard RSR model; which expands the dictionary with theidentity matrix to reconstruct corruption or occlusion in face images; is essentially a non-sparse solution with a relatively large residual. The reason why the RSR modelunderperforms may be its inappropriately expanded bases rather than the sparsity itself.Thereby; this study proposes to design a dictionary with an expanded noise bases set …,IET Computer Vision,2015,1
Side-effect estimation: A filtering approach to the view update problem,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Views and their updates have long been a fundamental technology required in a wide rangeof applications. However; it has been known that updates through views is a classicalintractable problem. In this paper; we propose a novel; data-oriented approach to thisproblem that provides a practical support for view updates. In particular; we propose asummarization of the source database of views; which serves as an update filter. The updatefilter aims to efficiently reject untranslatable view updates by estimating the side effects of theupdates; thereby avoiding costly translation analysis. For applications where estimationerrors are not preferred; our update filter can be tuned to be exact. In this paper; we presentour approach with SPJ views; an important class of view definitions. We first revise thenotion of estimation errors to quantify the filter's qualities. We then propose a novel join …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,1

Reducing Uncertainty of Probabilistic Top-$ k $ Ranking via Pairwise Crowdsourcing,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Zhe Fan,Probabilistic top-$ k $ ranking is an important and well-studied query operator in uncertaindatabases. However; the quality of top-$ k $ results might be heavily affected by theambiguity and uncertainty of the underlying data. Uncertainty reduction techniques havebeen proposed to improve the quality of top-$ k $ results by cleaning the original data.Unfortunately; most data cleaning models aim to probe the exact values of the objectsindividually and therefore do not work well for subjective data types; such as user ratings;which are inherently probabilistic. In this paper; we propose a novel pairwise crowdsourcingmodel to reduce the uncertainty of top-$ k $ ranking using a crowd of domain experts.

Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation for Realtime Wireless Data Dissemination,Chi-Wai Lin; Haibo Hu; Dik-Lun Lee,Abstract The combination of broadcast and on-demand data delivery services is aneconomic way to build a highly scalable wireless information system with limited bandwidth.The use of data broadcasting should be adaptive so that the system response time canalways be minimized. A traditional approach requires the development of a system responsetime equation in order to find the optimal solution. However; obtaining such an equation isnot always possible. We observe that by maintaining a certain level of on-demand requestarrival rate; a close approximation to the optimal solution can be obtained. Using thisapproach; a real-time adaptive data delivery algorithm is developed. Our algorithm does notrequire the access information of the data items to be known exactly; which is needednormally for this kind of optimization problems.
