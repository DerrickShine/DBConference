Manifold-ranking based image retrieval,Jingrui He; Mingjing Li; Hong-Jiang Zhang; Hanghang Tong; Changshui Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel transductive learning framework named manifold-ranking based image retrieval (MRBIR). Given a query image; MRBIR first makes use of amanifold ranking algorithm to explore the relationship among all the data points in thefeature space; and then measures relevance between the query and all the images in thedatabase accordingly; which is different from traditional similarity metrics based on pair-wisedistance. In relevance feedback; if only positive examples are available; they are added tothe query set to improve the retrieval result; if examples of both labels can be obtained;MRBIR discriminately spreads the ranking scores of positive and negative examples;considering the asymmetry between these two types of images. Furthermore; three activelearning methods are incorporated into MRBIR; which select images in each round of …,Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM international conference on Multimedia,2004,379
Blur detection for digital images using wavelet transform,Hanghang Tong; Mingjing Li; Hongjiang Zhang; Changshui Zhang,With the prevalence of digital cameras; the number of digital images increases quickly;which raises the demand for image quality assessment in terms of blur. Based on the edgetype and sharpness analysis; using the Harr wavelet transform; a new blur detection schemeis proposed in this paper; which can determine whether an image is blurred or not and towhat extent an image is blurred. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed scheme.,Multimedia and Expo; 2004. ICME'04. 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,309
Graph based anomaly detection and description: a survey,Leman Akoglu; Hanghang Tong; Danai Koutra,Abstract Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task; with numerous high-impact applicationsin areas such as security; finance; health care; and law enforcement. While numeroustechniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies inunstructured collections of multi-dimensional points; with graph data becoming ubiquitous;techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs havelong-range correlations; a suite of novel technology has been developed for anomalydetection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general; comprehensive; andstructured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data representedas graphs.

Center-piece subgraphs: problem definition and fast solutions,Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given Q nodes in a social network (say; authorship network); how can we find thenode/author that is the center-piece; and has direct or indirect connections to all; or most ofthem? For example; this node could be the common advisor; or someone who started theresearch area that the Q nodes belong to. Isomorphic scenarios appear in law enforcement(find the master-mind criminal; connected to all current suspects); gene regulatory networks(find the protein that participates in pathways with all or most of the given Q proteins); viralmarketing and many more. Connection subgraphs is an important first step; handling thecase of Q= 2 query nodes. Then; the connection subgraph algorithm finds the b intermediatenodes; that provide a good connection between the two original query nodes.

Fast best-effort pattern matching in large attributed graphs,Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos; Brian Gallagher; Tina Eliassi-Rad,Abstract We focus on large graphs where nodes have attributes; such as a social networkwhere the nodes are labelled with each person's job title. In such a setting; we want to findsubgraphs that match a user query pattern. For example; a" star" query would be;" find aCEO who has strong interactions with a Manager; a Lawyer; and an Accountant; or anotherstructure as close to that as possible". Similarly; a" loop" query could help spot a moneylaundering ring. Traditional SQL-based methods; as well as more recent graph indexingmethods; will return no answer when an exact match does not exist. This is the first mainfeature of our method. It can find exact-; as well as near-matches; and it will present them tothe user in our proposed" goodness" order. For example; our method tolerates indirect pathsbetween; say; the" CEO" and the" Accountant" of the above sample query; when direct …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2007,219

Rolx: structural role extraction & mining in large graphs,Keith Henderson; Brian Gallagher; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Hanghang Tong; Sugato Basu; Leman Akoglu; Danai Koutra; Christos Faloutsos; Lei Li,Abstract Given a network; intuitively two nodes belong to the same role if they have similarstructural behavior. Roles should be automatically determined from the data; and could be;for example;" clique-members;"" periphery-nodes;" etc. Roles enable numerous novel anduseful network-mining tasks; such as sense-making; searching for similar nodes; and nodeclassification. This paper addresses the question: Given a graph; how can we automaticallydiscover roles for nodes? We propose RolX (Role eXtraction); a scalable (linear in thenumber of edges); unsupervised learning approach for automatically extracting structuralroles from general network data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RolX on severalnetwork-mining tasks: from exploratory data analysis to network transfer learning. Moreover;we compare network role discovery with network community discovery. We highlight …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,150
Using ghost edges for classification in sparsely labeled networks,Brian Gallagher; Hanghang Tong; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract We address the problem of classification in partially labeled networks (aka within-network classification) where observed class labels are sparse. Techniques for statisticalrelational learning have been shown to perform well on network classification tasks byexploiting dependencies between class labels of neighboring nodes. However; relationalclassifiers can fail when unlabeled nodes have too few labeled neighbors to supportlearning (during training phase) and/or inference (during testing phase). This situation arisesin real-world problems when observed labels are sparse. In this paper; we propose a novelapproach to within-network classification that combines aspects of statistical relationallearning and semi-supervised learning to improve classification performance in sparsenetworks. Our approach works by adding" ghost edges" to a network; which enable the …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,150
Generalized manifold-ranking-based image retrieval,Jingrui He; Mingjing Li; H-J Zhang; Hanghang Tong; Changshui Zhang,In this paper; we propose a general transductive learning framework named generalizedmanifold-ranking-based image retrieval (gMRBIR) for image retrieval. Comparing with anexisting transductive learning method named MRBIR; our method could work well whetheror not the query image is in the database; thus; it is more applicable for real applications.Given a query image; gMRBIR first initializes a pseudo seed vector based on neighborhoodrelationship and then spread its scores via manifold ranking to all the unlabeled images inthe database. Furthermore; in gMRBIR; we also make use of relevance feedback and activelearning to refine the retrieval result so that it converges to the query concept as fast aspossible. Systematic experiments on a general-purpose image database consisting of 5 000Corel images demonstrate the superiority of gMRBIR over state-of-the-art techniques,IEEE Transactions on image processing,2006,128
Gelling; and melting; large graphs by edge manipulation,Hanghang Tong; B Aditya Prakash; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Michalis Faloutsos; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Controlling the dissemination of an entity (eg; meme; virus; etc) on a large graph isan interesting problem in many disciplines. Examples include epidemiology; computersecurity; marketing; etc. So far; previous studies have mostly focused on removing orinoculating nodes to achieve the desired outcome. We shift the problem to the level of edgesand ask: which edges should we add or delete in order to speed-up or contain adissemination? First; we propose effective and scalable algorithms to solve thesedissemination problems. Second; we conduct a theoretical study of the two problems andour methods; including the hardness of the problem; the accuracy and complexity of ourmethods; and the equivalence between the different strategies and problems.

Information spreading in context,Dashun Wang; Zhen Wen; Hanghang Tong; Ching-Yung Lin; Chaoming Song; Albert-László Barabási,Abstract Information spreading processes are central to human interactions. Despite recentstudies in online domains; little is known about factors that could affect the dissemination ofa single piece of information. In this paper; we address this challenge by combining tworelated but distinct datasets; collected from a large scale privacy-preserving distributedsocial sensor system. We find that the social and organizational context significantly impactsto whom and how fast people forward information. Yet the structures within spreadingprocesses can be well captured by a simple stochastic branching model; indicatingsurprising independence of context. Our results build the foundation of future predictivemodels of information flow and provide significant insights towards design of communicationplatforms.,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,121
Graph based multi-modality learning,Hanghang Tong; Jingrui He; Mingjing Li; Changshui Zhang; Wei-Ying Ma,Abstract To better understand the content of multimedia; a lot of research efforts have beenmade on how to learn from multi-modal feature. In this paper; it is studied from a graph pointof view: each kind of feature from one modality is represented as one independent graph;and the learning task is formulated as inferring from the constraints in every graph as well assupervision information (if available). For semi-supervised learning; two different fusionschemes; namely linear form and sequential form; are proposed. For each scheme; it isderived from optimization point of view; and further justified from two sides: similaritypropagation and Bayesian interpretation. By doing so; we reveal the regular optimizationnature; transductive learning nature as well as prior fusion nature of the proposed schemes;respectively.

It's who you know: graph mining using recursive structural features,Keith Henderson; Brian Gallagher; Lei Li; Leman Akoglu; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given a graph; how can we extract good features for the nodes? For example; giventwo large graphs from the same domain; how can we use information in one to doclassification in the other (ie; perform across-network classification or transfer learning ongraphs)? Also; if one of the graphs is anonymized; how can we use information in one to de-anonymize the other? The key step in all such graph mining tasks is to find effective nodefeatures. We propose ReFeX (Recursive Feature eXtraction); a novel algorithm; thatrecursively combines local (node-based) features with neighborhood (egonet-based)features; and outputs regional features--capturing" behavioral" information. We demonstratehow these powerful regional features can be used in within-network and across-networkclassification and de-anonymization tasks--without relying on homophily; or the …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,109
Colibri: fast mining of large static and dynamic graphs,Hanghang Tong; Spiros Papadimitriou; Jimeng Sun; Philip S Yu; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of a graph are essential in findingpatterns (such as communities) and detecting anomalies. Additionally; it is desirable to trackthe low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time; efficiently and within limited storage.Real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes; but are usually very sparse.However; standard decompositions such as SVD do not preserve sparsity. This has led tothe development of methods such as CUR and CMD; which seek a non-orthogonal basis bysampling the columns and/or rows of the sparse matrix. However; these approaches willtypically produce overcomplete bases; which wastes both space and time. In this paper wepropose the family of Colibri methods to deal with these challenges.

TANGENT: a novel;'Surprise me'; recommendation algorithm,Kensuke Onuma; Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Most of recommender systems try to find items that are most relevant to the olderchoices of a given user. Here we focus on the" surprise me" query: A user may be bored withhis/her usual genre of items (eg; books; movies; hobbies); and may want a recommendationthat is related; but off the beaten path; possibly leading to a new genre ofbooks/movies/hobbies. How would we define; as well as automate; this seeminglyselfcontradicting request? We introduce TANGENT; a novel recommendation algorithm tosolve this problem. The main idea behind TANGENT is to envision the problem as nodeselection on a graph; giving high scores to nodes that are well connected to the olderchoices; and at the same time well connected to unrelated choices. The method is carefullydesigned to be (a) parameter-free (b) effective and (c) fast.

Fast direction-aware proximity for graph mining,Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos; Yehuda Koren,Abstract In this paper we study asymmetric proximity measures on directed graphs; whichquantify the relationships between two nodes or two groups of nodes. The measures areuseful in several graph mining tasks; including clustering; link prediction and connectionsubgraph discovery. Our proximity measure is based on the conceptof escape probability.This way; we strive to summarize the multiple facets of nodes-proximity; while avoiding someof the pitfalls to which alternative proximity measures are susceptible. A unique feature of themeasures is accounting for the underlying directional information. We put a specialemphasis on computational efficiency; and develop fast solutions that are applicable inseveral settings. Our experimental study shows the usefulness of our proposed direction-aware proximity method for several applications; and that our algorithms achieve a …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2007,105

On the vulnerability of large graphs,Hanghang Tong; B Aditya Prakash; Charalampos Tsourakakis; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Christos Faloutsos; Duen Horng Chau,Given a large graph; like a computer network; which k nodes should we immunize (ormonitor; or remove); to make it as robust as possible against a computer virus attack? Weneed (a) a measure of the 'Vulnerability'of a given network; b) a measure of the 'Shield-value'of a specific set of k nodes and (c) a fast algorithm to choose the best such k nodes.We answer all these three questions: we give the justification behind our choices; we showthat they agree with intuition as well as recent results in immunology. Moreover; we proposeNet Shield; a fast and scalable algorithm. Finally; we give experiments on large real graphs;where Net Shield achieves tremendous speed savings exceeding 7 orders of magnitude;against straightforward competitors.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,104
Virus propagation on time-varying networks: Theory and immunization algorithms,B Aditya Prakash; Hanghang Tong; Nicholas Valler; Michalis Faloutsos; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given a contact network that changes over time (say; day vs night connectivity); andthe SIS (susceptible/infected/susceptible; flu like) virus propagation model; what can we sayabout its epidemic threshold? That is; can we determine when a small infection will “take-off”and create an epidemic? Consequently then; which nodes should we immunize to preventan epidemic? This is a very real problem; since; eg people have different connections duringthe day at work; and during the night at home. Static graphs have been studied for a longtime; with numerous analytical results. Time-evolving networks are so hard to analyze; thatmost existing works are simulation studies [5].

Classification of digital photos taken by photographers or home users,Hanghang Tong; Mingjing Li; Hong-Jiang Zhang; Jingrui He; Changshui Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we address a specific image classification task; ie to group imagesaccording to whether they were taken by photographers or home users. Firstly; a set of low-level features explicitly related to such high-level semantic concept are investigated togetherwith a set of general-purpose low-level features. Next; two different schemes are proposedto find out those most discriminative features and feed them to suitable classifiers: oneresorts to boosting to perform feature selection and classifier training simultaneously; theother makes use of the information of the label by Principle Component Analysis for featurere-extraction and feature de-correlation; followed by Maximum Marginal Diversity for featureselection and Bayesian classifier or Support Vector Machine for classification.

Centralities in large networks: Algorithms and observations,U Kang; Spiros Papadimitriou; Jimeng Sun; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Node centrality measures are important in a large number of graph applications;from search and ranking to social and biological network analysis. In this paper we studynode centrality for very large graphs; up to billions of nodes and edges. Various definitionsfor centrality have been proposed; ranging from very simple (eg; node degree) to moreelaborate. However; measuring centrality in billion-scale graphs poses several challenges.Many of the “traditional” definitions such as closeness and betweenness were not designedwith scalability in mind. Therefore; it is very difficult; if not impossible; to compute them bothaccurately and efficiently. In this paper; we propose centrality measures suitable for verylarge graphs; as well as scalable methods to effectively compute them. More specifically; wepropose effective closeness and LineRank which are designed for billion-scale graphs …,*,2011,99

Pics: Parameter-free identification of cohesive subgroups in large attributed graphs,Leman Akoglu; Hanghang Tong; Brendan Meeder; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given a graph with node attributes; how can we find meaningful patterns such asclusters; bridges; and outliers? Attributed graphs appear in real world in the form of socialnetworks with user interests; gene interaction networks with gene expression information;phone call networks with customer demographics; and many others. In effect; we want togroup the nodes into clusters with similar connectivity and homogeneous attributes. Mostexisting graph clustering algorithms either consider only the connectivity structure of thegraph and ignore the node attributes; or require several user-defined parameters such asthe number of clusters. We propose PICS; a novel; parameter-free method for miningattributed graphs. Two key advantages of our method are that (1) it requires no user-specified parameters such as the number of clusters and similarity functions; and (2) its …,*,2012,79

In this paper; we propose a novel active learning method named mean versionspace; aiming to select the optimal image in each round of relevance feedback. Firstly; bydiving into the lemma that motivates support vector machine active learning method (SVM<i>< inf> active</inf></i>); we come up with a new criterion which is tailored for each specificlearning task and will lead to the fastest shrinkage of the version space in all cases.

Diversified ranking on large graphs: an optimization viewpoint,Hanghang Tong; Jingrui He; Zhen Wen; Ravi Konuru; Ching-Yung Lin,Abstract Diversified ranking on graphs is a fundamental mining task and has a variety ofhigh-impact applications. There are two important open questions here. The first challengeis the measure-how to quantify the goodness of a given top-k ranking list that captures boththe relevance and the diversity? The second challenge lies in the algorithmic aspect-how tofind an optimal; or near-optimal; top-k ranking list that maximizes the measure we defined ina scalable way? In this paper; we address these challenges from an optimization point ofview. Firstly; we propose a goodness measure for a given top-k ranking list. The proposedgoodness measure intuitively captures both (a) the relevance between each individual nodein the ranking list and the query; and (b) the diversity among different nodes in the rankinglist.

Learning no-reference quality metric by examples,Hanghang Tong; Mingjing Li; Hong-Jiang Zhang; Changshui Zhang; Jingrui He; Wei-Ying Ma,In this paper; a novel learning based method is proposed for No-Reference image qualityassessment. Instead of examining the exact prior knowledge for the given type of distortionand finding a suitable way to represent it; our method aims to directly get the quality metricby means of learning. At first; some training examples are prepared for both high-quality andlow-quality classes; then a binary classifier is built on the training set; finally the qualitymetric of an un-labeled example is denoted by the extent to which it belongs to these twoclasses. Different schemes to acquire examples from a given image; to build the binaryclassifier and to model the quality metric are proposed and investigated. While most existingmethods are tailored for some specific distortion type; the proposed method might provide ageneral solution for No-Reference image quality assessment.

No-reference quality assessment for JPEG2000 compressed images,Hanghang Tong; Mingjing Li; Hong-Jiang Zhang; Changshui Zhang,No-reference quality assessment is a relatively new topic and has been attracting more andmore attention in recent years. Due to the limited understanding of the human vision system;most of the existing methods focus on measuring to what extent the image has beendistorted. In this paper; by viewing all edge points in JPEG2000 compressed images as'distorted'or'un-distorted'; we propose using principal component analysis (PCA) to extractthe local feature of a given edge point; which indicates both blurring and ringing. We alsopropose using the probabilities of the given edge point being'distorted'and'un-distorted'tomodel the local distortion metric; which is straightforward and can be easily applied to anytype of local feature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.,Image Processing; 2004. ICIP'04. 2004 International Conference on,2004,55

Unfortunately;virus writers have begun exploiting lax security in many mobile devices and subsequentlydeveloped malware exploiting proximity-based propagation mechanisms (eg Cabir orCommWarrior). So; if given an ad-hoc network of such mobile users; will a proximity-spreading virus survive or die out; that is; can we determine the “tipping point” betweensurvival and die out? What effect does the average user velocity have on such spread? Weanswer the initial questions and more.

Fast random walk graph kernel,U Kang; Hanghang Tong; Jimeng Sun,Abstract Random walk graph kernel has been used as an important tool for various datamining tasks including classification and similarity computation. Despite its usefulness;however; it suffers from the expensive computational cost which is at least O (n 3) or O (m 2)for graphs with n nodes and m edges. In this paper; we propose ARK; a set of fast algorithmsfor random walk graph kernel computation. Ark is based on the observation that real graphshave much lower intrinsic ranks; compared with the orders of the graphs.

Existing graph analysis techniquesare not appropriate for such data; especially in cases where streaming or near-real-timeresults are required. An example that has drawn significant research interest is the cyber-security domain; where internet communication traces are collected and real-time discoveryof events; behaviors; patterns; and anomalies is desired. We propose MetricForensics; ascalable framework for analysis of volatile graphs. MetricForensics combines a multi-level"drill down" approach; a collection of user-selected graph metrics; and a collection of analysistechniques. At each successive level; more sophisticated metrics are computed and thegraph is viewed at finer temporal resolutions. In this way; MetricForensics scales to highly …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,49
Recommending people in developers' collaboration network,Didi Surian; Nian Liu; David Lo; Hanghang Tong; Ee-Peng Lim; Christos Faloutsos,Many software developments involve collaborations of developers across the globe. This istrue for both open-source and closed-source development efforts. Developers collaborateon different projects of various types. As with any other teamwork endeavors; findingcompatibility among members in a development team is helpful towards the realization ofthe team's goal. Compatible members tend to share similar programming style and namingstrategy; communicate well with one another; etc. However; finding the right person to workwith is not an easy task. In this work; we extract information available from Source forge.

Graphite: A visual query system for large graphs,Duen Horng Chau; Christos Faloutsos; Hanghang Tong; Jason I Hong; Brian Gallagher; Tina Eliassi-Rad,We present Graphite; a system that allows the user to visually construct a query pattern; findsboth its exact and approximate matching subgraphs in large attributed graphs; andvisualizes the matches. For example; in a social network where a person's occupation is anattribute; the user can draw a'star'query for" finding a CEO who has interacted with aSecretary; a Manager; and an Accountant; or a structure very similar to this". Graphite usesthe G-Ray algorithm to run the query against a user-chosen data graph; gaining all of itsbenefits; namely its high speed; scalability; and its ability to find both exact and nearmatches. Therefore; for the example above; Graphite tolerates indirect paths between; say;the CEO and the Accountant; when no direct path exists. Graphite uses fast algorithms toestimate node proximities when finding matches; enabling it to scale well with the graph …,Data Mining Workshops; 2008. ICDMW'08.

Gbase: an efficient analysis platform for large graphs,U Kang; Hanghang Tong; Jimeng Sun; Ching-Yung Lin; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Graphs appear in numerous applications including cyber security; the Internet;social networks; protein networks; recommendation systems; citation networks; and manymore. Graphs with millions or even billions of nodes and edges are common-place. How tostore such large graphs efficiently? What are the core operations/queries on those graph?How to answer the graph queries quickly? We propose Gbase; an efficient analysis platformfor large graphs. The key novelties lie in (1) our storage and compression scheme for aparallel; distributed settings and (2) the carefully chosen graph operations and their efficientimplementations. We designed and implemented an instance of Gbase usingMapreduce/Hadoop.

Manifold-ranking-based keyword propagation for image retrieval,Hanghang Tong; Jingrui He; Mingjing Li; Wei-Ying Ma; Hong-Jiang Zhang; Changshui Zhang,Abstract A novel keyword propagation method is proposed for image retrieval based on arecently developed manifold-ranking algorithm. In contrast to existing methods which train abinary classifier for each keyword; our keyword model is constructed in a straightforwardmanner by exploring the relationship among all images in the feature space in the learningstage. In relevance feedback; the feedback information can be naturally incorporated torefine the retrieval result by additional propagation processes. In order to speed up theconvergence of the query concept; we adopt two active learning schemes to select imagesduring relevance feedback. Furthermore; by means of keyword model update; the systemcan be self-improved constantly. The updating procedure can be performed online duringrelevance feedback without extra offline training.

How can we effectively link an information network with a social network tosupport cross-network search? Graph alignment-the task of finding the nodecorrespondences between two given graphs-is a fundamental building block in numerousapplication domains; such as social networks analysis; bioinformatics; chemistry; patternrecognition. In this work; we focus on aligning bipartite graphs; a problem which has beenlargely ignored by the extensive existing work on graph matching; despite the ubiquity ofthose graphs (eg; users-groups network). We introduce a new optimization formulation andpropose an effective and fast algorithm to solve it. We also propose a fast generalization ofour approach to align unipartite graphs.

Make it or break it: Manipulating robustness in large networks,Hau Chan; Leman Akoglu; Hanghang Tong,Abstract The function and performance of networks rely on their robustness; defined as theirability to continue functioning in the face of damage (targeted attacks or random failures) toparts of the network. Prior research has proposed a variety of measures to quantifyrobustness and various manipulation strategies to alter it. In this paper; our contributions aretwofold. First; we critically analyze various robustness measures and identify their strengthsand weaknesses. Our analysis suggests natural connectivity; based on the weighted countof loops in a network; to be a reliable measure. Second; we propose the first principledmanipulation algorithms that directly optimize this robustness measure; which lead tosignificant performance improvement over existing; ad-hoc heuristic solutions.

Fractional immunization in networks,B Aditya Prakash; Lada Adamic; Theodore Iwashyna; Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Preventing contagion in networks is an important problem in public health and otherdomains. Targeting nodes to immunize based on their network interactions has been shownto be far more effective at stemming infection spread than immunizing random subsets ofnodes. However; the assumption that selected nodes can be rendered completely immunedoes not hold for infections for which there is no vaccination or effective treatment. Instead;one can confer fractional immunity to some nodes by allocating variable amounts of infection-prevention resource to them. We formulate the problem to distribute a fixed amount ofresource across nodes in a network such that the infection rate is minimized; prove that it isNP-complete and derive a highly effective and efficient linear-time algorithm. Wedemonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm compared to several other …,*,2013,33
Dual-regularized one-class collaborative filtering,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Guo Yan; Feng Xu; Xiang Zhang; Boleslaw K Szymanski; Jian Lu,Abstract Collaborative filtering is a fundamental building block in many recommendersystems. While most of the existing collaborative filtering methods focus on explicit; multi-class settings (eg; 1-5 stars in movie recommendation); many real-world applicationsactually belong to the one-class setting where user feedback is implicitly expressed (eg;views in news recommendation and video recommendation). The main challenges in suchone-class setting include the ambiguity of the unobserved examples and the sparseness ofexisting positive examples. In this paper; we propose a dual-regularized model for one-classcollaborative filtering. In particular; we address the ambiguity challenge by integrating twostate-of-the-art one-class collaborative filtering methods to enjoy the best of both worlds. Wetackle the sparseness challenge by exploiting the side information from both users and …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,31
Gmine: a system for scalable; interactive graph visualization and mining,José F Rodrigues Jr; Hanghang Tong; Agma JM Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Jure Leskovec,Abstract Several graph visualization tools exist. However; they are not able to handle largegraphs; and/or they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs; withhundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges: the first one is that anystraightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one issensory overload: even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly; the user would beoverwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too clutteredas nodes and edges overlap each other. Our GMine system addresses both these issues; byusing summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph explorationby partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storingit into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree.

Matri: a multi-aspect and transitive trust inference model,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xifeng Yan; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstract Trust inference; which is the mechanism to build new pair-wise trustworthinessrelationship based on the existing ones; is a fundamental integral part in many realapplications; eg; e-commerce; social networks; peer-to-peer networks; etc. State-of-the-arttrust inference approaches mainly employ the transitivity property of trust by propagatingtrust along connected users (aka trust propagation); but largely ignore other importantproperties; eg; prior knowledge; multi-aspect; etc. In this paper; we propose a multi-aspecttrust inference model by exploring an equally important property of trust; ie; the multi-aspectproperty. The heart of our method is to view the problem as a recommendation problem; andhence opens the door to the rich methodologies in the field of collaborative filtering.

Gender: A generic diversified ranking algorithm,Jingrui He; Hanghang Tong; Qiaozhu Mei; Boleslaw Szymanski,Abstract Diversified ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadlyapplicable in many real world problems; eg; information retrieval; team assembling; productsearch; etc. In this paper; we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-kranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity functionamong all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that ingeneral it is NP-hard. Then; we show that for a large volume of the parameter space; theproposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property; which enables us todesign a scalable; greedy algorithm to find the near-optimal solution. Experimental resultson real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2012,25
Replacing the irreplaceable: Fast algorithms for team member recommendation,Liangyue Li; Hanghang Tong; Nan Cao; Kate Ehrlich; Yu-Ru Lin; Norbou Buchler,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of TEAM MEMBER REPLACEMENT--given ateam of people embedded in a social network working on the same task; find a goodcandidate to best replace a team member who becomes unavailable to perform the task forcertain reason (eg; conflicts of interests or resource capacity). Prior studies in teamworkhave suggested that a good team member replacement should bring synergy to the team interms of having both skill matching and structure matching. However; existing techniqueseither do not cover both aspects or consider the two aspects independently. In this work; wepropose a novel problem formulation using the concept of graph kernels that takes intoaccount the interaction of both skill and structure matching requirements.

Events could be meetings with one or more persons and one or more agendaitems at zero or more locations (eg; teleconferences); or they could be publications withauthors; keywords; publishers; etc. In such settings; we want to find time stamps that looksimilar to each other and group them; we also want to find anomalies. In addition; we wantour approach to provide interpretations of the clusters and anomalies by annotating them.Furthermore; we want our approach to automatically find the right time-granularity in whichto do analysis.

In an increasinglyconnected and coupled world; the networks arising from many application domains are oftencollected from different channels; forming the so-called multi-layered networks; such ascyber-physical systems; organization-level collaboration platforms; critical infrastructurenetworks and many more. Compared with single-layered networks; multi-layered networksare more vulnerable as even a small disturbance on one supporting layer/network mightcause a ripple effect to all the dependent layers; leading to a catastrophic/cascading failureof the entire system.

Flexible and robust multi-network clustering,Jingchao Ni; Hanghang Tong; Wei Fan; Xiang Zhang,Abstract Integrating multiple graphs (or networks) has been shown to be a promisingapproach to improve the graph clustering accuracy. Various multi-view and multi-domaingraph clustering methods have recently been developed to integrate multiple networks. Inthese methods; a network is treated as a view or domain. The key assumption is that there isa common clustering structure shared across all views (domains); and different views(domains) provide compatible and complementary information on this underlying clusteringstructure. However; in many emerging real-life applications; different networks have differentdata distributions; where the assumption that all networks share a single common clusteringstructure does not hold. In this paper; we propose a flexible and robust framework thatallows multiple underlying clustering structures across different networks.

Rare category characterization,Jingrui He; Hanghang Tong; Jaime Carbonell,Rare categories abound and their characterization has heretofore received little attention.Fraudulent banking transactions; network intrusions; and rare diseases are examples of rareclasses whose detection and characterization are of high value. However; accuratecharacterization is challenging due to high-skewness and non-separability from majorityclasses; eg; fraudulent transactions masquerade as legitimate ones. This paper proposesthe RACH algorithm by exploring the compactness property of the rare categories. It isbased on an optimization framework which encloses the rare examples by a minimum-radius hyper ball. The framework is then converted into a convex optimization problem;which is in turn effectively solved in its dual form by the projected sub gradient method.RACH can be naturally kernelized.

Large graph analysis in the gmine system,Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Hanghang Tong; Jia-Yu Pan; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Christos Faloutsos,Current applications have produced graphs on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodesand millions of edges. To take advantage of such graphs; one must be able to find patterns;outliers; and communities. These tasks are better performed in an interactive environment;where human expertise can guide the process.

Towards Evolutionary Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,Fei Wang; Hanghang Tong; Ching-Yung Lin,Abstract Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) techniques has aroused considerableinterests from the field of artificial intelligence in recent years because of its goodinterpretability and computational efficiency.

This problem; referred to as the node immunization problem; is the core buildingblock in many high-impact applications; ranging from public health; cybersecurity to viralmarketing. A central component in node immunization is to find the best k bridges of a givengraph. In this setting; we typically want to determine the relative importance of a node (or aset of nodes) within the graph; for example; how valuable (as a bridge) a person or a groupof persons is in a social network. First of all; we propose a novelbridging'score Dλ; inspiredby immunology; and we show that its results agree with intuition for several realistic settings.Since the straightforward way to compute Dλ is computationally intractable; we then focus …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,18

In CQA sites; users can ask and answer questions; and providefeedback (eg; by voting or commenting) to these questions/answers. In this article; wepropose the early detection of high-quality CQA questions/answers. Such detection can helpdiscover a high-impact question that would be widely recognized by the users in these CQAsites; as well as identify a useful answer that would gain much positive feedback from siteusers.

Mining connection pathways for marked nodes in large graphs,Leman Akoglu; Duen Horng Chau; Jilles Vreeken; Nikolaj Tatti; Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Suppose we are given a large graph in which; by some external process; a handfulof nodes are marked. What can we say about these nodes? Are they close together in thegraph? or; if segregated; how many groups do they form? We approach this problem bytrying to find sets of simple connection pathways between sets of marked nodes. Weformalize the problem in terms of the Minimum Description Length principle: a pathway issimple when we need only few bits to tell which edges to follow; such that we visit all nodesin a group. Then; the best partitioning is the one that requires the least number of bits todescribe the paths that visit all the marked nodes. We prove that solving this problem is NP-hard; and introduce DOT2DOT; an efficient algorithm for partitioning marked nodes byfinding simple pathways between nodes.

Measuring proximity on graphs with side information,Hanghang Tong; Huiming Qu; Hani Jamjoom,This paper studies how to incorporate side information (such as users' feedback) inmeasuring node proximity on large graphs. Our method (ProSIN) is motivated by the well-studied random walk with restart (RWR). The basic idea behind ProSIN is to leverage sideinformation to refine the graph structure so that the random walk is biased towards/awayfrom some specific zones on the graph. Our case studies demonstrate that ProSIN is well-suited in a variety of applications; including neighborhood search; center-piece subgraphs;and image caption. Given the potential computational complexity of ProSIN; we alsopropose a fast algorithm (Fast-ProSIN) that exploits the smoothness of the graph structureswith/without side information. Our experimental evaluation shows that Fast-ProSIN achievessignificant speedups (up to 49x) over straightforward implementations.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Howcan we spot similar users; eg; virtual identical twins; in Cleveland for a New Yorker? Given aquery disease; how can we prioritize its candidate genes by incorporating the tissue-specificprotein interaction networks of those similar diseases? In most; if not all; of the existingnetwork ranking methods; the nodes are the ranking objects with the finest granularity. In thispaper; we propose a new network data model; a Network of Networks (NoN); where eachnode of the main network itself can be further represented as another (domain-specific)network. This new data model enables to compare the nodes in a broader context and rankthem at a finer granularity. Moreover; such an NoN model enables much more efficientsearch when the ranking targets reside in a certain domain-specific network.

To address this issue; we propose a novel factor matrix trace normminimization method for tensor completion problems. Based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition; we first formulate a factor matrix rank minimization model bydeducing the relation between the rank of each factor matrix and the mode-n rank of atensor.

In this paper we propose a novelsemi-supervised learning (SSL) approach; called semi-supervised learning with nuclearnorm regularization (SSL-NNR); which can simultaneously handle both sparse labeled dataand additional pairwise constraints together with unlabeled data. Specifically; we firstconstruct a unified SSL framework to combine the manifold assumption and the pairwiseconstraints assumption for classification tasks. Then we provide a modified fixed pointcontinuous algorithm to learn a low-rank kernel matrix that takes advantage of Laplacianspectral regularization. Finally; we develop a two-stage optimization strategy; and present asemi-supervised classification algorithm with enhanced spectral kernel (ESK). Moreover …,Pattern Recognition,2013,15
Panther: Fast top-k similarity search on large networks,Jing Zhang; Jie Tang; Cong Ma; Hanghang Tong; Yu Jing; Juanzi Li,Abstract Estimating similarity between vertices is a fundamental issue in network analysisacross various domains; such as social networks and biological networks. Methods basedon common neighbors and structural contexts have received much attention. However; bothcategories of methods are difficult to scale up to handle large networks (with billions ofnodes). In this paper; we propose a sampling method that provably and accurately estimatesthe similarity between vertices. The algorithm is based on a novel idea of random path.Specifically; given a network; we perform R random walks; each starting from a randomlypicked vertex and walking T steps. Theoretically; the algorithm guarantees that the samplingsize R= O (2ε-2 log 2 T) depends on the error-bound ε; the confidence level (1--δ); and thepath length T of each random walk.

User churn in focused question answering sites: characterizations and prediction,Jagat Sastry Pudipeddi; Leman Akoglu; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Given a user on a Q&A site; how can we tell whether s/he is engaged with the siteor is rather likely to leave? What are the most evidential factors that relate to users churning?Question and Answer (Q&A) sites form excellent repositories of collective knowledge. Tomake these sites self-sustainable and long-lasting; it is crucial to ensure that new users aswell as the site veterans who provide most of the answers keep engaged with the site. Assuch; quantifying the engagement of users and preventing churn in Q&A sites are vital toimprove the lifespan of these sites. We study a large data collection from stackoverflow. comto identify significant factors that correlate with newcomer user churn in the early stage andthose that relate to veterans leaving in the later stage.

Given the potential computationalcomplexity; we mainly devote ourselves to addressing the computational issues in this paperby proposing an efficient solution (referred to as iPoG-B) for bipartite graphs.

Boosting feed-forward neural network for Internet traffic prediction,Hang-Hang Tong; Chong-Rong Li; Jing-Rui He,Internet traffic prediction plays a fundamental role in network design; management; control;and optimization. The self-similar and non-linear nature of network traffic makes highaccurate prediction difficult in this paper; boosting is introduced into traffic prediction byconsidering it as a classical regression problem. A new scheme together with its adaptiveversion is proposed to update weight distribution. The new scheme controls the update rateby a parameter; while its adaptive version introduces no extra parameter and is adaptive tothe training error of basic regressors and the current iteration number. Experimental resultson real network traffic which exhibits both self-similarity and non-linearity demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method.,Machine Learning and Cybernetics; 2004.

Predicting long-term impact of CQA posts: a comprehensive viewpoint,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) sites have become valuable platforms tocreate; share; and seek a massive volume of human knowledge. How can we spot aninsightful question that would inspire massive further discussions in CQA sites? How can wedetect a valuable answer that benefits many users? The long-term impact (eg; the size of thepopulation a post benefits) of a question/answer post is the key quantity to answer thesequestions. In this paper; we aim to predict the long-term impact of questions/answers shortlyafter they are posted in the CQA sites. In particular; we propose a family of algorithms for theprediction problem by modeling three key aspects; ie; non-linearity; question/answercoupling; and dynamics. We analyze our algorithms in terms of optimality; correctness; andcomplexity. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on two real CQA data sets to …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,12
Mc-minh: Metagenome clustering using minwise based hashing,Zeehasham Rasheed; Huzefa Rangwala,Abstract Current bio-technologies allow sequencing of genomes from multiple organisms;that co-exist as communities within ecological environments. This collective genomicprocess (called metagenomics) has spurred the development of several computational toolsfor the quantification of abundance; diversity and role of different species within differentcommunities. Unsupervised clustering algorithms (also called binning algorithms) havebeen developed to group similar metagenome sequences. We have developed an algorithmcalled MC-MinH that uses the min-wise hashing approach; along with a greedy clusteringalgorithm to group 16S and whole metagenomic sequences. We represent unequal lengthsequences using contiguous subsequences or k-mers; and then approximate thecomputation of pairwise similarity using independent min-wise hashing.

Ice-Breaking: Mitigating Cold-Start Recommendation Problem by Rating Comparison.,Jingwei Xu; Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xianping Tao; Jian Lu,Abstract Recommender system has become an indispensable component in many e-commerce sites. One major challenge that largely remains open is the coldstart problem;which can be viewed as an ice barrier that keeps the cold-start users/items from the warmones. In this paper; we propose a novel rating comparison strategy (RAPARE) to break thisice barrier. The center-piece of our RAPARE is to provide a fine-grained calibration on thelatent profiles of cold-start users/items by exploring the differences between cold-start andwarm users/items. We instantiate our RAPARE strategy on the prevalent method inrecommender system; ie; the matrix factorization based collaborative filtering. Experimentalevaluations on two real data sets validate the superiority of our approach over the existingmethods in cold-start scenarios.,IJCAI,2015,11
Hierarchical focus+ context heterogeneous network visualization,Lei Shi; Qi Liao; Hanghang Tong; Yifan Hu; Yue Zhao; Chuang Lin,Aggregation is a scalable strategy for dealing with large network data. Existing networkvisualizations have allowed nodes to be aggregated based on node attributes or networktopology; each of which has its own advantages. However; very few previous systems havethe capability to enjoy the best of both worlds. This paper presents OnionGraph; anintegrated framework for exploratory visual analysis of large heterogeneous networks.OnionGraph allows nodes to be aggregated based on either node attributes; topology; or amixture of both.

Spatial-temporal traffic flow pattern identification and anomaly detection with dictionary-based compression theory in a large-scale urban network,Zhenhua Zhang; Qing He; Hanghang Tong; Jizhan Gou; Xiaoling Li,Abstract Traffic flow pattern identification; as well as anomaly detection; is an importantcomponent for traffic operations and control. To reveal the characteristics of regional trafficflow patterns in large road networks; this paper employs dictionary-based compressiontheory to identify the features of both spatial and temporal patterns by analyzing the multi-dimensional traffic-related data. An anomaly index is derived to quantify the network traffic inboth spatial and temporal perspectives. Both pattern identifications are conducted in threedifferent geographic levels: detector; intersection; and sub-region. From different geographiclevels; this study finds several important features of traffic flow patterns; including thegeographic distribution of traffic flow patterns; pattern shifts at different times-of-day; patternfluctuations over different days; etc. Both spatial and temporal traffic flow patterns defined …,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2016,10
Similarity group-by operators for multi-dimensional relational data,Mingjie Tang; Ruby Y Tahboub; Walid G Aref; Mikhail J Atallah; Qutaibah M Malluhi; Mourad Ouzzani; Yasin N Silva,The SQL group-by operator plays an important role in summarizing and aggregating largedatasets in a data analytics stack. While the standard group-by operator; which is based onequality; is useful in several applications; allowing similarity aware grouping provides amore realistic view on real-world data that could lead to better insights. The Similarity SQL-based Group-By operator (SGB; for short) extends the semantics of the standard SQL Group-by by grouping data with similar but not necessarily equal values. While existing similarity-based grouping operators efficiently realize these approximate semantics; they primarilyfocus on one-dimensional attributes and treat multi-dimensional attributes independently.However; correlated attributes; such as in spatial data; are processed independently; andhence; groups in the multi-dimensional space are not detected properly.

Fast eigen-functions tracking on dynamic graphs,Chen Chen; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Many important graph parameters can be expressed as eigen-functions of itsadjacency matrix. Examples include epidemic threshold; graph robustness; etc. It is often ofkey importance to accurately monitor these parameters. For example; knowing that Ebolavirus has already been brought to the US continent; to avoid the virus from spreading away;it is important to know which emerging connections among related people would causegreat reduction on the epidemic threshold of the network. However; most; if not all; of theexisting algorithms computing these measures assume that the input graph is static; despitethe fact that almost all real graphs are evolving over time. In this paper; we propose twoonline algorithms to track the eigen-functions of a dynamic graph with linear complexity wrtthe number of nodes and number of changed edges in the graph.

MET: A fast algorithm for minimizing propagation in large graphs with small eigen-gaps,Long T Le; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Given the topology of a graph G and a budget k; how can we quickly find the best kedges to delete that minimize dissemination in G? Stopping dissemination in a graph isimportant in a variety of fields from epidemiology to cyber security. The spread of an entity(eg; a virus) on an arbitrary graph depends on two properties:(1) the topology of the graphand (2) the characteristics of the entity. In many settings; we cannot manipulate the latter;such as the entity's strength. That leaves us with modifying the former (eg; by removingnodes and/or edges from the graph in order to reduce the graph's connectivity). In this work;we address the problem of removing edges. We know that the largest eigenvalue of thegraph's adjacency matrix is a good indicator for its connectivity (aka path capacity). Thus;algorithms that are able to quickly reduce the largest eigenvalue of a graph often …,*,2015,10
Method and system for detecting anomalies in a bipartite graph,*,A method of detecting anomalies from a bipartite graph includes analyzing the graph todetermine a row-cluster membership; a column-cluster membership and a non-negativeresidual matrix; and in a processor; detecting the anomalies from the non-negative residualmatrix.,*,2013,10
Overlapping clustering with sparseness constraints,Haibing Lu; Yuan Hong; W Nick Street; Fei Wang; Hanghang Tong,Overlapping clustering allows a data point to be a member of multiple clusters; which ismore appropriate for modeling many real data semantics. However; much of the existingwork on overlapping clustering simply assume that a data point can be assigned to anynumber of clusters without any constraint. This assumption is not supported by many realcontexts. In an attempt to reveal true data cluster structure; we propose sparsity constrainedoverlapping clustering by incorporating sparseness constraints into an overlappingclustering process. To solve the derived sparsity constrained overlapping clusteringproblems; efficient and effective algorithms are proposed. Experiments demonstrate theadvantages of our overlapping clustering model.,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,10
Final: Fast attributed network alignment,Si Zhang; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Multiple networks naturally appear in numerous high-impact applications. Networkalignment (ie; finding the node correspondence across different networks) is often the veryfirst step for many data mining tasks. Most; if not all; of the existing alignment methods aresolely based on the topology of the underlying networks. Nonetheless; many real networksoften have rich attribute information on nodes and/or edges. In this paper; we propose afamily of algorithms FINAL to align attributed networks. The key idea is to leverage thenode/edge attribute information to guide (topology-based) alignment process. We formulatethis problem from an optimization perspective based on the alignment consistency principle;and develop effective and scalable algorithms to solve it.

Robust multi-network clustering via joint cross-domain cluster alignment,Rui Liu; Wei Cheng; Hanghang Tong; Wei Wang; Xiang Zhang,Network clustering is an important problem thathas recently drawn a lot of attentions. Mostexisting workfocuses on clustering nodes within a single network. In manyapplications;however; there exist multiple related networks; inwhich each network may be constructedfrom a different domainand instances in one domain may be related to instances inotherdomains. In this paper; we propose a robust algorithm; MCA; formulti-networkclustering that takes into account cross-domain relationshipsbetween instances. MCA hasseveral advantages overthe existing single network clustering methods. First; it is abletodetect associations between clusters from different domains; which; however; is notaddressed by any existing methods. Second; it achieves more consistent clustering resultson multiple networksby leveraging the duality between clustering individual networksand …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,9
Fast mining of a network of coevolving time series,Yongjie Cai; Hanghang Tong; Wei Fan; Ping Ji,Abstract Coevolving multiple time series are ubiquitous and naturally appear in a variety ofhigh-impact applications; ranging from environmental monitoring; computer network trafficmonitoring; motion capture; to physiological signal in health care and many more. In manyscenarios; the multiple time series data is often accompanied by some contextualinformation in the form of networks. In this paper; we refer to such multiple time series;together with its embedded network as a network of coevolving time series. In order to unveilthe underlying patterns of a network of coevolving time series; we propose DCMF; adynamic contextual matrix factorization algorithm. The key idea is to find the latent factorrepresentation of the input time series and that of its embedded network simultaneously.

Subgraph extraction for trust inference in social networks,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,While a great many useful statistical models and visualizations have been developed toexplore large-scale complex networks; fewer have attempted to relate these models to datagenerated by samples. While; in many fields; complete (or near-complete) data is widelyavailable; and while the Internet has made even more readily available; complete dataabout large-scale complex networks sufficient to answer many compelling social sciencequestions does not exist and cannot be reasonably generated. In these cases; samplingtheory must be used to connect data to models. This proves difficult for a variety of reasonssuch as: data collection methodologies which; while attempting to overcome nonresponsebias; deviate from standard sampling practices; and; the non-independence of both firstneighbors and second neighbors.

Multiple random walk and its application in content-based image retrieval,Jingrui He; Hanghang Tong; Mingjing Li; Wei-Ying Ma; Changshui Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we propose a transductive learning method for content-based imageretrieval: Multiple Random Walk (MRW). Its basic idea is to construct two generative modelsby means of Markov random walks; one for images relevant to the query concept and theother for the irrelevant ones. The goal is to obtain the likelihood functions of both classes.Firstly; MRW generates two random walks with virtual absorbing boundaries; and uses theabsorbing probabilities as the initial estimation of the likelihood functions. Then it refines thetwo random walks through an EM-like iterative procedure in order to get more accurateestimation of the likelihood functions. Class priors are also obtained in this procedure.Finally; MRW ranks all the unlabeled images in the database according to their posteriorprobabilities of being relevant. By using both labeled and unlabeled data; MRW can be …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGMM international workshop on Multimedia information retrieval,2005,9
Large-scale off-target identification using fast and accurate dual regularized one-class collaborative filtering and its application to drug repurposing,Hansaim Lim; Aleksandar Poleksic; Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Di He; Luke Zhuang; Patrick Meng; Lei Xie,Target-based screening is one of the major approaches in drug discovery. Besides theintended target; unexpected drug off-target interactions often occur; and many of them havenot been recognized and characterized. The off-target interactions can be responsible foreither therapeutic or side effects. Thus; identifying the genome-wide off-targets of leadcompounds or existing drugs will be critical for designing effective and safe drugs; andproviding new opportunities for drug repurposing. Although many computational methodshave been developed to predict drug-target interactions; they are either less accurate thanthe one that we are proposing here or computationally too intensive; thereby limiting theircapability for large-scale off-target identification. In addition; the performances of mostmachine learning based algorithms have been mainly evaluated to predict off-target …,PLoS computational biology,2016,8

The first characteristic is volume; whichcorresponds to the fact that the data is being generated at unprecedented scale. Forexample; it is estimated that [16] there were more than 13 exabytes of new data stored byenterprises and users in 2010.

Big Data Clustering.,Hanghang Tong; U Kang,With the advance of Web2. 0; the data size is increasing explosively. For example; Twitterdata spans several terabytes; Wikipedia data (eg; articles and authors) is of similar size; webclickthrough data is reported to reach petabyte scale [36]; Yahoo! web graph in 2002 hasmore than 1 billion nodes and almost 7 billion edges [27]. On the other hand; many dataclustering algorithms have a high intrinsic time complexity. For example; the classic k-meansclustering is NP-hard even when k= 2. The normalized cut (NCut); a representative spectralclustering algorithm; is also NP-hard [43]. Therefore; a key challenge for data clustering liesin its scalability; that is; how we can speed up/scale up the clustering algorithms with theminimum sacrifice to the clustering quality.

Pack: Scalable parameter-free clustering on k-partite graphs,Jingrui He; Hanghang Tong; Spiros Papadimitriou; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Christos Faloutsos; Jaime Carbonell,Abstract Given an author-paper-conference graph; how can we automatically find groups forauthor; paper and conference respectively. Existing work either (1) requires fine tuning ofseveral parameters; or (2) can only be applied to bipartite graphs (eg; author-paper graph;or paper-conference graph). To address this problem; in this paper; we propose PaCK forclustering such k-partite graphs. By optimizing an information-theoretic criterion; PaCKsearches for the best number of clusters for each type of object and generates thecorresponding clustering. The unique feature of PaCK over existing methods for clustering k-partite graphs lies in its parameter-free nature. Furthermore; it can be easily generalized tothe cases where certain connectivity relations are expressed as tensors; eg; time-evolvingdata.

A boosting-based framework for self-similar and non-linear Internet traffic prediction,Hanghang Tong; Chongrong Li; Jingrui He,Abstract Internet traffic prediction plays a fundamental role in network design; management;control; and optimization. The self-similar and non-linear nature of network traffic makeshighly accurate prediction difficult. In this paper; a boosting-based framework is proposed forself-similar and non-linear traffic prediction by considering it as a classical regressionproblem. The framework is based on Ada-Boost on the whole. It adopts PrincipleComponent Analysis as an optional step to take advantage of self-similar nature of trafficwhile avoiding the disadvantage of self-similarity. Feed-forward neural network is used asthe basic regressor to capture the non-linear relationship within the traffic. Experimentalresults on real network traffic validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.,International Symposium on Neural Networks,2004,8

In theory; this problem can be solved by the natural convexjoint/mixed relaxations (ie; l 1-norm and trace norm) under certain conditions.

Efficient egonet computation in a weighted directed graph,*,An embodiment of the invention pertains to a weighted directed graph comprising multiplenodes and edges that each extends between two nodes. The embodiment includesprocessing edges to generate a forward and reverse edge corresponding to each edge.Forward and reverse edges are processed to generate indirect edges; each comprising twoedge components; and extending between two nodes. One node associated with eachforward edge; each reverse edge; and each indirect edge is selected to be the key node ofits associated edge. All forward; reverse and indirect edges having a particular node as theirrespective key nodes are placed into a group. All edges of the group are then selectivelyprocessed to provide information pertaining to an egonet of the graph that has the particularnode as its egonode.,*,2014,7

These changes yield an altered graph. Afterwards; proximity information is determinedfrom the altered graph.,*,2013,7
Internet traffic prediction by w-boost: classification and regression,Hanghang Tong; Chongrong Li; Jingrui He; Yang Chen,Abstract Internet traffic prediction plays a fundamental role in network design; management;control; and optimization. The self-similar and non-linear nature of network traffic makeshighly accurate prediction difficult. In this paper; we proposed a new boosting scheme;namely W-Boost; for traffic prediction from two perspectives: classification and regression. Tocapture the non-linearity of the traffic while introducing low complexity into thealgorithm;'stump'and piece-wise-constant function are adopted as weak learners forclassification and regression; respectively. Furthermore; a new weight update scheme isproposed to take the advantage of the correlation information within the traffic for bothmodels. Experimental results on real network traffic which exhibits both self-similarity andnon-linearity demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed W-Boost.,International Symposium on Neural Networks,2005,7
Boosting web image search by co-ranking,Jingrui He; Changshui Zhang; Nanyuan Zhao; Hanghang Tong,To maximally improve the precision among top-ranked images returned by a Web imagesearch engine without putting extra burden on the user; we propose in this paper a novel co-ranking framework which re-ranks the retrieved images to move the irrelevant ones to the tailof the list. The characteristics of the proposed framework can be summarized as follows:(1)making use of the decisions from multi-view of images to boost retrieval performance;(2)generalizing present multi-view algorithms which need labeled data for initialization to theunsupervised case so that no extra interaction is required. To implement the framework; weuse one-class support vector machines to train the basic learner; and propose differentschemes for combination. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed framework.,Acoustics; Speech; and Signal Processing; 2005. Proceedings.(ICASSP'05). IEEE International Conference on,2005,7
Multi-aspect+ transitivity+ bias: An integral trust inference model,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xifeng Yan; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Inferring the pair-wise trust relationship is a core building block for many real applications.State-of-the-art approaches for such trust inference mainly employ the transitivity property oftrust by propagating trust along connected users; but largely ignore other importantproperties such as trust bias; multi-aspect; etc. In this paper; we propose a new trustinference model to integrate all these important properties. To apply the model to both binaryand continuous inference scenarios; we further propose a family of effective and efficientalgorithms. Extensive experimental evaluations on real data sets show that our methodachieves significant improvement over several existing benchmark approaches; for bothquantifying numerical trustworthiness scores and predicting binary trust/distrust signs. Inaddition; it enjoys linear scalability in both time and space.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,6
An effective framework for characterizing rare categories,Jingrui He; Hanghang Tong; Jaime Carbonell,Abstract Rare categories become more and more abundant and their characterization hasreceived little attention thus far. Fraudulent banking transactions; network intrusions; andrare diseases are examples of rare classes whose detection and characterization are of highvalue. However; accurate characterization is challenging due to high-skewness andnonseparability from majority classes; eg; fraudulent transactions masquerade as legitimateones. This paper proposes the RACH algorithm by exploring the compactness property ofthe rare categories. This algorithm is semi-supervised in nature since it uses both labeledand unlabeled data. It is based on an optimization framework which encloses the rareexamples by a minimum-radius hyperball. The framework is then converted into a convexoptimization problem; which is in turn effectively solved in its dual form by the projected …,Frontiers of Computer Science,2012,6
Non‐negative residual matrix factorization: problem definition; fast solutions; and applications,Hanghang Tong; Ching‐Yung Lin,Abstract Matrix factorization is a very powerful tool to find graph patterns; eg communities;anomalies; etc. A recent trend is to improve the usability of the discovered graph patterns; byencoding some interpretation-friendly properties (eg; non-negativity; sparseness; etc) in thefactorization. Most; if not all; of these methods are tailored for the task of communitydetection. We propose NrMF; a non-negative residual matrix factorization framework; aimingto improve the interpretation for graph anomaly detection. We present two optimizationformations and their corresponding optimization solutions. Our method can naturally captureabnormal behaviors on graphs. We further generalize it to admit sparse constrains in theresidual matrix.

Disease gene prioritization by integrating tissue-specific molecular networks using a robust multi-network model,Jingchao Ni; Mehmet Koyuturk; Hanghang Tong; Jonathan Haines; Rong Xu; Xiang Zhang,Accurately prioritizing candidate disease genes is an important and challenging problem.Various network-based methods have been developed to predict potential disease genes byutilizing the disease similarity network and molecular networks such as protein interaction orgene co-expression networks. Although successful; a common limitation of the existingmethods is that they assume all diseases share the same molecular network and a singlegeneric molecular network is used to predict candidate genes for all diseases. However;different diseases tend to manifest in different tissues; and the molecular networks indifferent tissues are usually different. An ideal method should be able to incorporate tissue-specific molecular networks for different diseases. In this paper; we develop a robust andflexible method to integrate tissue-specific molecular networks for disease gene …,BMC bioinformatics,2016,5

Flow-based influence graph visual summarization,Lei Shi; Hanghang Tong; Jie Tang; Chuang Lin,Visually mining a large influence graph is appealing yet challenging. Existing summarizationmethods enhance the visualization with blocked views; but have adverse effect on the latentinfluence structure. How can we visually summarize a large graph to maximize influenceflows? In particular; how can we illustrate the impact of an individual node through thesummarization?

Joint voting prediction for questions and answers in CQA,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Tao Xie; Leman Akoglu; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Community Question Answering (CQA) sites have become valuable repositories that host amassive volume of human knowledge. How can we detect a high-value answer which clearsthe doubts of many users? Can we tell the user if the question s/he is posting would attract agood answer? In this paper; we aim to answer these questions from the perspective of thevoting outcome by the site users. Our key observation is that the voting score of an answer isstrongly positively correlated with that of its question; and such correlation could be in turnused to boost the prediction performance. Armed with this observation; we propose a familyof algorithms to jointly predict the voting scores of questions and answers soon after they areposted in the CQA sites.

Matrust: An effective multi-aspect trust inference model,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xifeng Yan; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstract: Trust is a fundamental concept in many real-world applications such as e-commerce and peer-to-peer networks. In these applications; users can generate localopinions about the counterparts based on direct experiences; and these opinions can thenbe aggregated to build trust among unknown users. The mechanism to build new trustrelationships based on existing ones is referred to as trust inference. State-of-the-art trustinference approaches employ the transitivity property of trust by propagating trust alongconnected users. In this paper; we propose a novel trust inference model (MaTrust) byexploring an equally important property of trust; ie; the multi-aspect property. MaTrust directlycharacterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generatedtrust relationships. Furthermore; it can naturally incorporate prior knowledge as specified …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.2041,2012,5

Roles couldbe; eg.;'bridges'; or'peripherynodes'; etc. Roles are compact summaries of a node's behaviorthat generalize across networks. They enable numerous novel and useful network miningtasks; such as sense-making; searching for similar nodes; and node classification.

Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of RolX on several network mining tasks; from exploratorydata analysis to network transfer learning. Moreover; we compare network role discoverywith network community discovery. We highlight fundamental differences between the two(eg; roles generalize across disconnected networks; communities do not).,*,2011,5

Tag2word: Using tags to generate words for content based tag recommendation,Yong Wu; Yuan Yao; Feng Xu; Hanghang Tong; Jian Lu,Abstract Tag recommendation is helpful for the categorization and searching of onlinecontent. Existing tag recommendation methods can be divided into collaborative filteringmethods and content based methods. In this paper; we put our focus on the content basedtag recommendation due to its wider applicability. Our key observation is the tag-content co-occurrence; ie; many tags have appeared multiple times in the corresponding content.Based on this observation; we propose a generative model (Tag2Word); where we generatethe words based on the tag-word distribution as well as the tag itself.

How canwe optimize the underlying graph structure to affect the outcome of such disseminationprocesses in a desired way (eg; stop a virus propagation; facilitate the propagation of apiece of good idea; etc)? Existing research suggests that the leading eigenvalue of theunderlying graph is the key metric in determining the so-called epidemic threshold for avariety of dissemination models.

Full diffusion history reconstruction in networks,Zhen Chen; Hanghang Tong; Lei Ying,Diffusion processes in networks can be used to model many real-world processes. Analysisof diffusion traces can help us answer important questions such as the source of diffusionand the role of each node in the diffusion process. However; in large-scale networks; it isvery expensive if not impossible to monitor the entire network to collect the completediffusion trace. This paper considers diffusion history reconstruction from a partialobservation and develops a greedy; step-by-step reconstruction algorithm. It is proved thatthe algorithm always produces a diffusion history that is consistent with the partialobservation. Our experimental results based on real networks and real diffusion data showthat the algorithm significantly outperforms some existing methods.,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,4

However; current methods for computinggraph kernels assume the input graphs are static; which is often not the case in reality. It ishighly desirable to track the graph kernels on dynamic graphs evolving over time in a timelymanner. In this paper; we propose a family of Cheetah algorithms to deal with the challenge.Cheetah leverages the low rank structure of graph updates and incrementally updates theeigen-decomposition or SVD of the adjacency matrices of graphs. Experimental evaluationson real world graphs validate our algorithms (1) are significantly faster than alternatives withhigh accuracy and (b) scale sub-linearly.,*,2015,4

On the eigen‐functions of dynamic graphs: Fast tracking and attribution algorithms,Chen Chen; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Eigen-functions are of key importance in graph mining since they can be used toapproximate many graph parameters; such as node centrality; epidemic threshold; graphrobustness; with high accuracy. As real-world graphs are changing over time; thoseparameters may get sharp changes correspondingly. Taking virus propagation network forexample; new connections between infected and susceptible people appear all the time;and some of the crucial infections may lead to large decreasing on the epidemic threshold ofthe network. As a consequence; the virus would spread around the network quickly.However; if we can keep track of the epidemic threshold as the graph structure changes;those crucial infections would be identified timely so that counter measures can be takenproactively to contain the spread process.

What can we say about these marked nodes? Are they all close-by inthe graph; or are they segregated into multiple groups? How can we automaticallydetermine how many; if any groups they form as well as find simple paths that connect thenodes in each group? We formalize the problem in terms of the Minimum Description Lengthprinciple: a set of paths is simple when we need few bits to describe each path from onenode to another. For example; we want to avoid high-degree nodes; unless we need to visitmany of its spokes. As such; the best partitioning requires the least number of bits todescribe the paths that visit all marked nodes. We show that our formulation for findingsimple paths between groups of nodes has connections to well-known other problems in …,*,2013,3

Then; the global optimal solution isdeveloped in both closed form and iterative form; providing that the latter converges to theformer.

First: Fast interactive attributed subgraph matching,Boxin Du; Si Zhang; Nan Cao; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Attributed subgraph matching is a powerful tool for explorative mining of largeattributed networks. In many applications (eg; network science of teams; intelligenceanalysis; finance informatics); the user might not know what exactly s/he is looking for; andthus require the user to constantly revise the initial query graph based on what s/he findsfrom the current matching results. A major bottleneck in such an interactive matchingscenario is the efficiency; as simply rerunning the matching algorithm on the revised querygraph is computationally prohibitive. In this paper; we propose a family of effective andefficient algorithms (FIRST) to support interactive attributed subgraph matching. There aretwo key ideas behind the proposed methods. The first is to recast the attributed subgraphmatching problem as a cross-network node similarity problem; whose major computation …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,2
A local algorithm for structure-preserving graph cut,Dawei Zhou; Si Zhang; Mehmet Yigit Yildirim; Scott Alcorn; Hanghang Tong; Hasan Davulcu; Jingrui He,Abstract Nowadays; large-scale graph data is being generated in a variety of real-worldapplications; from social networks to co-authorship networks; from protein-protein interactionnetworks to road traffic networks. Many existing works on graph mining focus on the verticesand edges; with the first-order Markov chain as the underlying model. They fail to explore thehigh-order network structures; which are of key importance in many high impact domains.For example; in bank customer personally identifiable information (PII) networks; the starstructures often correspond to a set of synthetic identities; in financial transaction networks;the loop structures may indicate the existence of money laundering.

NEMO: Next Career Move Prediction with Contextual Embedding,Liangyue Li; How Jing; Hanghang Tong; Jaewon Yang; Qi He; Bee-Chung Chen,Abstract With increased globalization and labor mobility; human resource reallocationacross firms; industries and regions has become the new norm in labor markets. Theemergence of massive digital traces of such mobility offers a unique opportunity tounderstand labor mobility at an unprecedented scale and granularity. While most studies onlabor mobility have largely focused on characterizing macro-level (eg; region or company) ormicro-level (eg; employee) patterns; the problem of how to accurately predict an employee'snext career move (which company with what job title) receives little attention.

Topic: Toward perfect influence graph summarization,Lei Shi; Sibai Sun; Yuan Xuan; Yue Su; Hanghang Tong; Shuai Ma; Yang Chen,Summarizing large influence graphs is crucial for many graph visualization and miningtasks. Classical graph clustering and compression algorithms focus on summarizing thenodes by their structural-level or attribute-level similarities; but usually are not designed tocharacterize the flow-level pattern which is the centerpiece of influence graphs. On the otherhand; the social influence analysis has been intensively studied; but little is done on thesummarization problem without an explicit focus on social networks. Building on the recentstudy of the Influence Graph Summarization (IGS); this paper presents a new perspective ofthe underlying flow-based heuristic. It establishes a direct linkage between the optimalsummarization and the classic eigenvector centrality of the graph nodes.

Towards Optimal Connectivity on Multi-Layered Networks,Chen Chen; Jingrui He; Nadya Bliss; Hanghang Tong,Networks are prevalent in many high impact domains. Moreover; cross-domain interactionsare frequently observed in many applications; which naturally form the dependenciesbetween different networks. Such kind of highly coupled network systems are referred to asmulti-layered networks; and have been used to characterize various complex systems;including critical infrastructure networks; cyber-physical systems; collaboration platforms;biological systems; and many more. Different from single-layered networks where thefunctionality of their nodes is mainly affected by within-layer connections; multi-layerednetworks are more vulnerable to disturbance as the impact can be amplified through cross-layer dependencies; leading to the cascade failure to the entire system.

Characterizing success pathways in networked graphs,*,Methods and systems for inferring performance include a chain graph that has multiplenodes; one or more of which has a known value at a first timestamp. A value associated witha first node at the first timestamp influences a value associated with a second nodeconnected to the first node by an edge at the first timestamp. Each node has an associatedchain that represents values of the node at different timestamps. Known values of each nodein the graph are propagated within each timestamp to all neighboring nodes. Known valuesof each node in the graph are propagated across different timestamps.,*,2017,1
HoORaYs: High-order Optimization of Rating Distance for Recommender Systems,Jingwei Xu; Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Xianping Tao; Jian Lu,Abstract Latent factor models have become a prevalent method in recommender systems; topredict users' preference on items based on the historical user feedback. Most of the existingmethods; explicitly or implicitly; are built upon the first-order rating distance principle; whichaims to minimize the difference between the estimated and real ratings. In this paper; wegeneralize such first-order rating distance principle and propose a new latent factor model(HoORaYs) for recommender systems. The core idea of the proposed method is to explorehigh-order rating distance; which aims to minimize not only (i) the difference between theestimated and real ratings of the same (user; item) pair (ie; the first-order rating distance); butalso (ii) the difference between the estimated and real rating difference of the same useracross different items (ie; the second-order rating distance).

Most of the existingmethods aim to find a single subgraph with a high density. However; dense subgraphs atdifferent granularities could reveal more intriguing patterns in the underlying graph. In thispaper; we propose to hierarchically detect dense subgraphs. The key idea of our method(HiDDen) is to envision the density of subgraphs as a relative measure to its background (ie;the subgraph at the coarse granularity). Given that the hierarchical dense subgraphdetection problem is essentially a nonconvex quadratic programming problem; we proposeeffective and efficient alternative projected gradient based algorithms to solve it.

Examples of such kind of network systems include critical infrastructure networks;biological systems; organization-level collaborations; cross-platform e-commerce; and soforth. One crucial structure that distances multi-layered network from other network models isits cross-layer dependency; which describes the associations between the nodes fromdifferent layers. Needless to say; the cross-layer dependency in the network plays anessential role in many data mining applications like system robustness analysis andcomplex network control. However; it remains a daunting task to know the exact dependencyrelationships due to noise; limited accessibility; and so forth.

To be specific; we will address the following fundamental researchquestions in the context of direction-aware proximity: 1. Problem definitions: How to define adirectionaware proximity? 2.

GTA 3 2018: Workshop on Graph Techniques for Adversarial Activity Analytics,Jiejun Xu; Hanghang Tong; Tsai-Ching Lu; Jingrui He; Nadya Bliss,Abstract Networks are natural analytic tools in modeling adversarial activities (eg; humantrafficking; illicit drug production; terrorist financial transaction) using different intelligencedata sources. However; such activities are often covert and embedded across multipledomains and contexts. They are generally not detectable and recognizable from theperspective of an isolated network; and only become apparent when multiple networks areanalyzed in a joint manner. Thus; one of the main research topics in modeling adversarialactivities is to develop effective techniques to align and fuse information from differentnetworks into a unified representation for global analysis.

Uncovering Teamwork in Networks–Prediction; Optimization and Explanation,Liangyue Li; Hanghang Tong,A. Motivations. Teams are defined as people who are readily identifiable to each other byrole and position. Individuals work together in teams to develop synergy. The ultimateoutcome is expected to be greater than the sum of each individual. The performance of ateam depends upon many factors; eg; individual's ability; levels of commitment and theirability to work with others; etc. It is critical to understand the mechanism that drives theperformance and provide measures to help struggling teams or enhance an existing team'sperformance. B. Problem Description. In this work; we consider teams as subgraphsembedded in a larger social network and tackle three complementary research tasks;namely; prediction; optimization and explanation.

Fast and flexible top-k similarity search on large networks,Jing Zhang; Jie Tang; Cong Ma; Hanghang Tong; Yu Jing; Juanzi Li; Walter Luyten; Marie-Francine Moens,Abstract Similarity search is a fundamental problem in network analysis and can be appliedin many applications; such as collaborator recommendation in coauthor networks; friendrecommendation in social networks; and relation prediction in medical information networks.In this article; we propose a sampling-based method using random paths to estimate thesimilarities based on both common neighbors and structural contexts efficiently in very largehomogeneous or heterogeneous information networks. We give a theoretical guarantee thatthe sampling size depends on the error-bound &epsiv;; the confidence level (1-δ); and thepath length T of each random walk. We perform an extensive empirical study on a Tencentmicroblogging network of 1;000;000;000 edges. We show that our algorithm can return top-ksimilar vertices for any vertex in a network 300× faster than the state-of-the-art methods …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,*
Scalable Algorithms for CQA Post Voting Prediction,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Community Question Answering (CQA) sites; such as Stack Overflow and Yahoo! Answers;have become very popular in recent years. These sites contain rich crowdsourcingknowledge contributed by the site users in the form of questions and answers; and thesequestions and answers can satisfy the information needs of more users. In this article; weaim at predicting the voting scores of questions/answers shortly after they are posted in theCQA sites. To accomplish this task; we identify three key aspects that matter with the votingof a post; ie; the non-linear relationships between features and output; the question andanswer coupling; and the dynamic fashion of data arrivals. A family of algorithms areproposed to model the above three key aspects. Some approximations and extensions arealso proposed to scale up the computation.

User-guided Cross-domain Sentiment Classification,Arun Reddy Nelakurthi; Hanghang Tong; Ross Maciejewski; Nadya Bliss; Jingrui He,Abstract Sentiment analysis has been studied for decades; and it is widely used in many realapplications such as media monitoring. In sentiment analysis; when addressing the problemof limited labeled data from the target domain; transfer learning; or domain adaptation; hasbeen successfully applied; which borrows information from a relevant source domain withabundant labeled data to improve the prediction performance in the target domain. The keyto transfer learning is how to model the relatedness among different domains. For sentimentanalysis; a common practice is to assume similar sentiment polarity for the commonkeywords shared by different domains. However; existing methods largely overlooked thehuman factor; ie; the users who expressed such sentiment. In this paper; we address thisproblem by explicitly modeling the human factor related to sentiment classification. In …,*,2017,*
Version-Aware Rating Prediction for Mobile App Recommendation,Yuan Yao; Wayne Xin Zhao; Yaojing Wang; Hanghang Tong; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstract With the great popularity of mobile devices; the amount of mobile apps has grown ata more dramatic rate than ever expected. A technical challenge is how to recommendsuitable apps to mobile users. In this work; we identify and focus on a unique characteristicthat exists in mobile app recommendation—that is; an app usually corresponds to multiplerelease versions. Based on this characteristic; we propose a fine-grain version-aware apprecommendation problem. Instead of directly learning the users' preferences over the apps;we aim to infer the ratings of users on a specific version of an app. However; the user-version rating matrix will be sparser than the corresponding user-app rating matrix; makingexisting recommendation methods less effective. In view of this; our approach has made twomajor extensions. First; we leverage the review text that is associated with each rating …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,*

However; existing techniques for large graph explorationare limited in either providing too little context or presenting graphs with too much distortion.In this paper; we propose a novel focus+ context technique; iSphere; to address thelimitation. iSphere maps a large graph onto a Riemann Sphere that better preserves graphstructures and shows greater context information.

Multiple virtual conductors allow amateur orchestra players to perform better and more easily,Ryosuke Takatsu; Yusaku Maki; Tomoo Inoue; Ken-ichi Okada; Hiroshi Shigeno,Many studies have focused on supporting orchestral performers. In some of these studies;researchers helped multiple players perform without conductors by using a system thatconducts the orchestra with artificial; or virtual conductors. Several approaches have beentaken in this field. Some conduct players using a conductor made from computer graphics;while others conduct through the changing or moving of figures. However; these studieshave not demonstrated how to conduct specific instructions for each player. We propose agroup of personalized virtual conductors for a group of players such as an orchestra. Todate; the studies of virtual conductors have only addressed a single conductor. However;because the required dynamics; tempo; and nuances are different based on each player'srole and part; personalized conduct may be desirable.

Network based models and path based features for gene prioritization,Yuechang Liu; Hanghang Tong; Xie Lei; Yong Tang,Network analysis has been shown to be an effective and cheap way to screen genes thatare associated to diseases and chemicals. The identification of features that are used toorder potentially related genes is key to do this job. Though many network models andstructure based features have been proposed in the literature; they do not perform wellenough for such gene prioritization task; especially when the heterogeneity of such networksis taken account. In this paper; a type of heterogeneous network called Generalized Bi-relational Network (GBN) is formalized. A series of path based features on GBN are defined.Though some of the features have been used in other literature; it is the first time to evaluatethem in both supervised and unsupervised learning models.

Supervised Link Prediction Using Random Walks,Yuechang Liu; Hanghang Tong; Lei Xie; Yong Tang,Abstract Network structure has become increasingly popular in big-data representation overthe last few years. As a result; network based analysis techniques are applied to networkscontaining millions of nodes. Link prediction helps people to uncover the missing orunknown links between nodes in networks; which is an essential task in network analysis.Random walk based methods have shown outstanding performance in such task. However;the primary bottleneck for such methods is adapting to networks with different structure anddynamics; and scaling to the network magnitude. Inspired by Random Walk with Restart(RWR); a promising approach for link prediction; this paper proposes a set of path basedfeatures and a supervised learning technique; called Supervised Random Walk with Restart(SRWR) to identify missing links.

Full Diffusion History Reconstruction in Networks,Hanghang Tong; Lei Ying,Abstract The diffusion process in networks can be used to model many real-worldprocesses; such as the spread of diseases; the propagation of a computer virus; and thepropagation of information through a social network. Analysis of diffusion models canprovide answers to important questions about epidemic-type phenomena. This makes itpossible to trace networks back to the source or predict patterns in future scenarios.However; it is very expensive and difficult to monitor every node in the entire network andcreate a complete diffusion trace. Therefore; a simple; inexpensive; and accurate method isneeded to map diffusion in networks. Researchers at Arizona State University have inventeda method to reconstruct the diffusion history from partial diffusion data.

Pairwise trust inference by subgraph extraction,Yuan Yao; Hanghang Tong; Feng Xu; Jian Lu,Abstr act Inferring pairwise trustworthiness is a core building block behind many realapplications; eg; e-commence; p2p networks; mobile ad hoc network; etc. Most of theexisting inference algorithms suffer from the scalability and usability issues due to the largescale of the underlying social networks. In this paper; we propose subgraph extraction toaddress these challenges. The core of the proposed method consists of two stages: pathselection and component induction. The path selection stage is flexible and it admits manyof existing top-k path extraction algorithms. We propose two evolutionary algorithms forcomponent induction stage. Our method has two main advantages. First; the outputs of bothstages can be used as an intermediate step to speed up a variety of existing trust inferencealgorithms.

An Effective Framework for Characterizing Rare Category,Jingrui He; Hanghang Tong; Jaime Carbonell,Abstract—Rare categories abound and their characterization has heretofore received littleattention. Fraudulent banking transactions; network intrusions; and rare diseases areexamples of rare classes whose detection and characterization are of high value. However;accurate characterization is challenging due to high-skewness and non-separability frommajority classes; eg; fraudulent transactions masquerade as legitimate ones. This paperproposes the RACH algorithm by exploring the compactness property of the rare categories.This algorithm is semi-supervised in nature since it uses both labeled data and unlabeleddata. It is based on an optimization framework which encloses the rare examples by aminimum-radius hyperball. The framework is then converted into a convex optimizationproblem; which is in turn effectively solved in its dual form by the projected subgradient …,*,*,*

The damage can be in the form ofintentional targeted attacks or failures of random or cascading nature. Prior research hasproposed various measures to assess graph robustness as well as various manipulationstrategies to alter it. In this work; our contributions are two-fold. First; we critically analyze adiverse list of proposed robustness measures and identify their strengths and weaknesses inquantifying graph robustness.

Matching Approximate Patterns in Richly-Attributed Graphs,Robert Pienta; Acar Tamersoy; Hanghang Tong; Duen Horng Chau,Abstract—Given a large graph with millions of nodes and edges; say a social network whereboth its nodes and edges have multiple attributes (eg; job titles; tie strengths); how to quicklyfind subgraphs of interest (eg; a ring of businessmen with strong ties)? We present MAGE; ascalable; multicore subgraph matching approach that supports expressive queries overlarge; richly-attributed graphs. Our major contributions include:(1) MAGE supports graphswith both node and edge attributes (most existing approaches handle either one; but notboth);(2) it supports expressive queries; allowing multiple attributes on an edge; wildcardsas attribute values (ie; match any permissible values); and attributes with continuous values;and (3) it is scalable; supporting graphs with several hundred million edges. Wedemonstrate MAGE's effectiveness and scalability via extensive experiments on large real …,*,*,*
Factor Matrix Nuclear Norm Minimization for Low-Rank Tensor Completion,Yuanyuan Liu; Fanhua Shang; Hong Cheng; James Cheng; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Most existing low-n-rank minimization algorithms for tensor completion suffer fromhigh computational cost due to involving multiple singular value decompositions (SVDs) ateach iteration. To address this issue; we propose a novel factor matrix rank minimizationmethod for tensor completion problems. Based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)decomposition; we first formulate a factor matrix rank minimization model by deducing therelation between the rank of each factor matrix and the mode-n rank of a tensor. Then; weintroduce a tractable relaxation of our rank function; which leads to a convex combinationproblem of much smaller scale matrix nuclear norm minimization. Finally; we develop anefficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme to solve the proposedproblem. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data validate the …,*,*,*

Tools and Algorithms for Querying and Mining Large Graphs,Hanghang Tong,1 Abstract Graphs appear in a wide range of settings; such as computer networks; the worldwide web; biological networks; social networks (MSN/FaceBook/LinkedIn) and many more.How can we find user-specific patterns (eg; master mind; money laundry ring) from suchgraphs? How can we spot anomaly in a dynamic and intuitive way? How can we find thecommunities with optional constraints? How can we mine time/space in the complexcontext? In this thesis; we focus on two types of tasks according to the interaction withusers:(1) querying and (2) mining. For the task of querying; we have mainly studied thefollowing three sub tasks. First; we focus on how to find complex user-specific patterns fromlarge graphs; where we have addressed three applications:(1) Center-piece subgraphdiscovery for plain graphs;(2) Best effort pattern match for attributed graphs; and (3) …,*,*,*
CMU-ML-06-109 Fast Random Walk with Restart and Its Applications,Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos; Jia-Yu Pan,How closely related are two nodes in a graph? How to compute this score quickly; on huge;disk-resident; real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevancescore between two nodes in a weighted graph; and it has been successfully used innumerous settings; like automatic captioning of images; generalizations to the" connectionsubgraphs"; personalized PageRank; and many more. However; the straightforwardimplementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs; requiring either quadratic space andcubic pre-computation time; or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions tothis problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared bymany real graphs:(a) linear correlations and (b) block-wise; community-like structure. Weexploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation; and the community structure …,*,*,*

SHIFTR: A Fast and Scalable System for Ad Hoc Sensemaking of Large Graphs,Duen Horng Chau; Aniket Kittur; Hanghang Tong; Christos Faloutsos; Jason I Hong,ABSTRACT We present SHIFTR; a system that assists users in making sense of large scalegraph data. Making sense of information represented as large graphs is a fundamentalchallenge in many data-intensive domains. We suggest the potential of strong synergiesbetween the data mining; cognitive psychology; and HCI communities in matching powerfulgraph mining tools with insights into how people learn and interact with information; andhere we present SHIFTR as one such application. SHIFTR adapts the Belief Propagationalgorithm to target important sensemaking tasks such as flexibly reorganizing graph entitiesinto multiple groups based on both positive and negative examples. SHIFTR scales linearlywith the graph size through its fast algorithm; novel mList data structure; and externalizationof graph meta data.,*,*,*
