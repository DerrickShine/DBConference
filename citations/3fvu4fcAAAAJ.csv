Influence and correlation in social networks,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Ravi Kumar; Mohammad Mahdian,Abstract In many online social systems; social ties between users play an important role indictating their behavior. One of the ways this can happen is through social influence; thephenomenon that the actions of a user can induce his/her friends to behave in a similar way.In systems where social influence exists; ideas; modes of behavior; or new technologies candiffuse through the network like an epidemic. Therefore; identifying and understandingsocial influence is of tremendous interest from both analysis and design points of view. Thisis a difficult task in general; since there are factors such as homophily or unobservedconfounding variables that can induce statistical correlation between the actions of friends ina social network. Distinguishing influence from these is essentially the problem ofdistinguishing correlation from causality; a notoriously hard statistical problem.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,654
The importance of being expert: Efficient max-finding in crowdsourcing,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Adriano Fazzone; Ida Mele; Matteo Riondato,Abstract Crowdsourcing is a computational paradigm whose distinctive feature is theinvolvement of human workers in key steps of the computation. It is used successfully toaddress problems that would be hard or impossible to solve for machines. As we highlight inthis work; the exclusive use of nonexpert individuals may prove ineffective in some cases;especially when the task at hand or the need for accurate solutions demand some degree ofspecialization to avoid excessive uncertainty and inconsistency in the answers. We addressthis limitation by proposing an approach that combines the wisdom of the crowd with theeducated opinion of experts. We present a computational model for crowdsourcing thatenvisions two classes of workers with different expertise levels. One of its distinctive featuresis the adoption of the threshold error model; whose roots are in psychometrics and which …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,218
A simulated annealing approach to the traveling tournament problem,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Laurent Michel; Pascal Van Hentenryck; Yannis Vergados,Abstract Automating the scheduling of sport leagues has received considerable attention inrecent years; as these applications involve significant revenues and generate challengingcombinatorial optimization problems. This paper considers the traveling tournament problem(TTP) which abstracts the salient features of major league baseball (MLB) in the UnitedStates. It proposes a simulated annealing algorithm (TTSA) for the TTP that explores bothfeasible and infeasible schedules; uses a large neighborhood with complex moves; andincludes advanced techniques such as strategic oscillation and reheats to balance theexploration of the feasible and infeasible regions and to escape local minima at very lowtemperatures. TTSA matches the best-known solutions on the small instances of the TTPand produces significant improvements over previous approaches on the larger instances …,Journal of Scheduling,2006,185
Online team formation in social networks,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Stefano Leonardi,Abstract We study the problem of online team formation. We consider a setting in whichpeople possess different skills and compatibility among potential team members is modeledby a social network. A sequence of tasks arrives in an online fashion; and each task requiresa specific set of skills. The goal is to form a new team upon arrival of each task; so that (i)each team possesses all skills required by the task;(ii) each team has small communicationoverhead; and (iii) the workload of performing the tasks is balanced among people in thefairest possible way. We propose efficient algorithms that address all these requirements:our algorithms form teams that always satisfy the required skills; provide approximationguarantees with respect to team communication overhead; and they are online-competitivewith respect to load balancing. Experiments performed on collaboration networks among …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,177
Persistent authenticated dictionaries and their applications,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Michael T Goodrich; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract We introduce the notion of persistent authenticated dictionaries; that is; dictionarieswhere the user can make queries of the type “was element e in set S at time t?” and getauthenticated answers. Applications include credential and certificate validation checking inthe past (as in digital signatures for electronic contracts); digital receipts; and electronictickets. We present two data structures that can efficiently support an infrastructure forpersistent authenticated dictionaries; and we compare their performance.,International Conference on Information Security,2001,136
Global distance-based segmentation of trajectories,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Michail Vlachos; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Eamonn Keogh; Philip S Yu,Abstract This work introduces distance-based criteria for segmentation of object trajectories.Segmentation leads to simplification of the original objects into smaller; less complexprimitives that are better suited for storage and retrieval purposes. Previous work ontrajectory segmentation attacked the problem locally; segmenting separately each trajectoryof the database. Therefore; they did not directly optimize the inter-object separability; whichis necessary for mining operations such as searching; clustering; and classification on largedatabases. In this paper we analyze the trajectory segmentation problem from a globalperspective; utilizing data aware distance-based optimization techniques; which optimizepairwise distance estimates hence leading to more efficient object pruning. We first deriveexact solutions of the distance-based formulation. Due to the intractable complexity of the …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,98
Sampling search-engine results,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Andrei Z Broder; David Carmel,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently sampling Web search engine query results.In turn; using a small random sample instead of the full set of results leads to efficientapproximate algorithms for several applications; such as: Determining the set of categoriesin a given taxonomy spanned by the search results; Finding the range of metadata valuesassociated with the result set in order to enable “multi-faceted search”; Estimating the size ofthe result set; Data mining associations to the query terms. We present and analyze efficientalgorithms for obtaining uniform random samples applicable to any search engine that isbased on posting lists and document-at-a-time evaluation.(To our knowledge; all popularWeb search engines; for example; Google; Yahoo Search; MSN Search; Ask; belong to thisclass.) Furthermore; our algorithm can be modified to follow the modern object-oriented …,World Wide Web,2006,95
Power in unity: forming teams in large-scale community systems,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Stefano Leonardi,Abstract The internet has enabled the collaboration of groups at a scale that was unseenbefore. A key problem for large collaboration groups is to be able to allocate taskseffectively. An effective task assignment method should consider both how fit teams are foreach job as well as how fair the assignment is to team members; in terms that no one shouldbe overloaded or unfairly singled out. The assignment has to be done automatically or semi-automatically given that it is difficult and time-consuming to keep track of the skills and theworkload of each person. Obviously the method to do this assignment must also becomputationally efficient. In this paper we present a general framework for task assignmentproblems. We provide a formal treatment on how to represent teams and tasks. We proposealternative functions for measuring the fitness of a team performing a task and we discuss …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,89
Just-in-time contextual advertising,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Andrei Z Broder; Evgeniy Gabrilovich; Vanja Josifovski; Lance Riedel,Abstract Contextual Advertising is a type of Web advertising; which; given the URL of a Webpage; aims to embed into the page (typically via JavaScript) the most relevant textual adsavailable. For static pages that are displayed repeatedly; the matching of ads can be basedon prior analysis of their entire content; however; ads need to be matched also to new ordynamically created pages that cannot be processed ahead of time. Analyzing the entirebody of such pages on-the-fly entails prohibitive communication and latency costs. To solvethe three-horned dilemma of either low-relevance or high-latency or high-load; we proposeto use text summarization techniques paired with external knowledge (exogenous to thepage) to craft short page summaries in real time. Empirical evaluation proves that matchingads on the basis of such summaries does not sacrifice relevance; and is competitive with …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,86
An optimization framework for query recommendation,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Query recommendation is an integral part of modern search engines. The goal ofquery recommendation is to facilitate users while searching for information. Queryrecommendation also allows users to explore concepts related to their information needs. Inthis paper; we present a formal treatment of the problem of query recommendation. In ourframework we model the querying behavior of users by a probabilistic reformula-tion graph;or query-flow graph [Boldi et al. CIKM 2008]. A sequence of queries submitted by a user canbe seen as a path on this graph. Assigning score values to queries allows us to definesuitable utility functions and to consider the expected utility achieved by a reformulation pathon the query-flow graph. Providing recommendations can be seen as adding shortcuts in thequery-flow graph that" nudge" the reformulation paths of users; in such a way that users …,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,84
Identification and measurement of social influence and correlation,*,Techniques for detecting social influence between users in a set of users with regard to anactivity are provided. Data for each user of the set of users is received that includes a timevalue at which the user became active with regard to the activity; and includes at least oneindication of another user in the set of users associated with the user. A first estimate ofsocial correlation in the set of users is determined based on the data. The data is modified.For instance; the data may be modified according to a shuffle test and/or an edge reversaltest. A second estimate of social correlation in the set of users is determined based on themodified data. The first estimate is compared to the second estimate to determine a degreeof social influence in the set of users.,*,2013,65
Approximation algorithms for co-clustering,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Anirban Dasgupta; Ravi Kumar,Abstract Co-clustering is the simultaneous partitioning of the rows and columns of a matrixsuch that the blocks induced by the row/column partitions are good clusters. Motivated byseveral applications in text mining; market-basket analysis; and bioinformatics; this problemhas attracted severe attention in the past few years. Unfortunately; to date; most of thealgorithmic work on this problem has been heuristic in nature.,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,62
Just-In-Time Contextual Advertising Techniques,*,A system and method to facilitate real-time matching of content to advertising information ina network are described. A request for advertising information is received over a network;the advertising information to be displayed for a user entity in association with contentinformation within a web page requested by the user entity; the request containing thecontent information; a web page identifier; and additional data associated with the webpage. The content information is further analyzed in real-time to construct a page summaryof the web page. The web page identifier and the additional data are further analyzed in real-time to extract at least one keyword relevant to the content information. Finally; theadvertising information is determined in real-time based on the page summary and theextracted keywords.,*,2009,53
Event detection in activity networks,Polina Rozenshtein; Aris Anagnostopoulos; Aristides Gionis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract With the fast growth of smart devices and social networks; a lot of computingsystems collect data that record different types of activities. An important computationalchallenge is to analyze these data; extract patterns; and understand activity trends. Weconsider the problem of mining activity networks to identify interesting events; such as a bigconcert or a demonstration in a city; or a trending keyword in a user community in a socialnetwork. We define an event to be a subset of nodes in the network that are close to eachother and have high activity levels. We formalize the problem of event detection using twograph-theoretic formulations. The first one captures the compactness of an event using thesum of distances among all pairs of the event nodes. We show that this formulation can bemapped to the maxcut problem; and thus; it can be solved by applying standard …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,46
A simple and deterministic competitive algorithm for online facility location,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Russell Bent; Eli Upfal; Pascal Van Hentenryck,Abstract This paper presents a deterministic and efficient algorithm for online facility location.The algorithm is based on a simple hierarchical partitioning and is extremely simple toimplement. It also applies to a variety of models; ie; models where the facilities can beplaced anywhere in the region; or only at customer sites; or only at fixed locations. Thepaper shows that the algorithm is O (log n)-competitive under these various models; where nis the total number of customers. It also shows that the algorithm is O (1)-competitive withhigh probability and for any arrival order when customers are uniformly distributed or whenthey follow a distribution satisfying a smoothness property. Experimental results for a varietyof scenarios indicate that the algorithm behaves extremely well in practice.,Information and Computation,2004,42
Effective and efficient classification on a search-engine model,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Andrei Broder; Kunal Punera,Abstract Traditional document classification frameworks; which apply the learned classifierto each document in a corpus one by one; are infeasible for extremely large documentcorpora; like the Web or large corporate intranets. We consider the classification problem ona corpus that has been processed primarily for the purpose of searching; and thus ouraccess to documents is solely through the inverted index of a large scale search engine. Ourmain goal is to build the “best” short query that characterizes a document class usingoperators normally available within search engines. We show that surprisingly goodclassification accuracy can be achieved on average over multiple classes by queries with asfew as 10 terms. As part of our study; we enhance some of the feature-selection techniquesthat are found in the literature by forcing the inclusion of terms that are negatively …,Knowledge and information systems,2008,34
Viral misinformation: The role of homophily and polarization,Alessandro Bessi; Fabio Petroni; Michela Del Vicario; Fabiana Zollo; Aris Anagnostopoulos; Antonio Scala; Guido Caldarelli; Walter Quattrociocchi,Nowadays; everyone can produce and access a variety of information by activelyparticipating in the diffusion and reinforcement of narratives. The spreading ofunsubstantiated rumors; whether intentional or unintentional; could have seriousconsequences; the World Economic Forum has listed massive digital misinformation as oneof the main risks for the modern society [1]. An interesting example is the popular case ofSenator Cirenga's law; proposing to fund policy makers with 134 million of euros (10% of theItalian GDP) in case of defeat in the political competition. This was an intentional joke—thetext of the post was explicitly mentioning its provocative nature—which became popularwithin online political activists.

A mazing 2+ ε approximation for unsplittable flow on a path,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabrizio Grandoni; Stefano Leonardi; Andreas Wiese,Abstract We study the unsplittable flow on a path problem (UFP); which arises naturally inmany applications such as bandwidth allocation; job scheduling; and caching. Here we aregiven a path with nonnegative edge capacities and a set of tasks; which are characterizedby a subpath; a demand; and a profit. The goal is to find the most profitable subset of taskswhose total demand does not violate the edge capacities. Not surprisingly; this problem hasreceived a lot of attention in the research community. If the demand of each task is at most asmall enough fraction δ of the capacity along its subpath (δ-small tasks); then it has beenknown for a long time [Chekuri et al.; ICALP 2003] how to compute a solution of valuearbitrarily close to the optimum via LP rounding. However; much remains unknown for thecomplementary case; that is; when the demand of each task is at least some fraction δ> 0 …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms,2014,28
Algorithms on evolving graphs,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Ravi Kumar; Mohammad Mahdian; Eli Upfal; Fabio Vandin,Abstract Motivated by applications that concern graphs that are evolving and massive innature; we define a new general framework for computing with such graphs. In ourframework; the graph changes over time and an algorithm can only track these changes byexplicitly probing the graph. This framework captures the inherent tradeoff between thecomplexity of maintaining an up-to-date view of the graph and the quality of resultscomputed with the available view. We apply this framework to two classical graphconnectivity problems; namely; path connectivity and minimum spanning trees; and obtainefficient algorithms.,Proceedings of the 3rd Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference,2012,27
Finding `Who Is Talking to Whom' in VoIP Networks via Progressive Stream Clustering,Olivier Verscheure; Michail Vlachos; Aris Anagnostopoulos; Pascal Frossard; Eric Bouillet; Philip S Yu,Technologies that use the Internet network to deliver voice communications have thepotential to reduce costs and improve access to communications services around the world.However; these new technologies pose several challenges in terms of confidentiality of theconversations and anonymity of the conversing parties. Call authentication and encryptiontechniques provide a way to protect confidentiality; while anonymity is typically preserved byan anonymizing service (anonymous call). This work studies the feasibility of revealing pairsof anonymous and encrypted conversing parties (caller/callee pair of streams) by exploitingthe vulnerabilities inherent to VoIP systems. In particular; by exploiting the aperiodic inter-departure time of VoIP packets; we can trivialize each VoIP stream into a binary time-series.We first define a simple yet intuitive metric to gauge the correlation between two VoIP …,Data Mining; 2006.

Peer and authority pressure in information-propagation models,Aris Anagnostopoulos; George Brova; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Existing models of information diffusion assume that peer influence is the mainreason for the observed propagation patterns. In this paper; we examine the role of authoritypressure on the observed information cascades. We model this intuition by characterizingsome nodes in the network as “authority” nodes. These are nodes that can influence largenumber of peers; while themselves cannot be influenced by peers. We propose a model thatassociates with every item two parameters that quantify the impact of the peer and theauthority pressure on the item's propagation. Given a network and the observed diffusionpatterns of the item; we learn these parameters from the data and characterize the item aspeer-or authority-propagated. We also develop a randomization test that evaluates thestatistical significance of our findings and makes our item characterization robust to noise …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,22
Constant integrality gap LP formulations of unsplittable flow on a path,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabrizio Grandoni; Stefano Leonardi; Andreas Wiese,Abstract The Unsplittable Flow Problem on a Path (UFPP) is a core problem in manyimportant settings such as network flows; bandwidth allocation; resource constraintscheduling; and interval packing. We are given a path with capacities on the edges and aset of tasks; each task having a demand; a profit; a source and a destination vertex on thepath. The goal is to compute a subset of tasks of maximum profit that does not violate theedge capacities. In practical applications generic approaches such as integer programming(IP) methods are desirable. Unfortunately; no IP-formulation is known for the problem whoseLP-relaxation has an integrality gap that is provably constant. For the unweighted case; weshow that adding a few constraints to the standard LP of the problem is sufficient to make theintegrality gap drop from Ω (n) to O (1).

Load balancing in arbitrary network topologies with stochastic adversarial input,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Adam Kirsch; Eli Upfal,We study the long-term (steady state) performance of a simple; randomized; local loadbalancing technique under a broad range of input conditions. We assume a system of nprocessors connected by an arbitrary network topology. Jobs are placed in the processorsby a deterministic or randomized adversary. The adversary knows the current and past loaddistribution in the network and can use this information to place the new tasks in theprocessors. A node can execute one job per step; and can also participate in one loadbalancing operation in which it can move tasks to a direct neighbor in the network. In theprotocol we analyze here; a node equalizes its load with a random neighbor in the graph.Our analysis of the protocol does not assume any particular input distribution.

In this model;the data changes gradually and the goal of an algorithm is to compute the solution to someproblem on the data at each time step; under the constraint that it only has limited access tothe data each time. As the data is constantly changing and the algorithm might be unawareof these changes; it cannot be expected to always output the exact right solution; we areinterested in algorithms that guarantee to output an approximate solution.

Stochastic query covering,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Stefano Leonardi; Ida Mele; Piotr Sankowski,Abstract In this paper we introduce the problem of query covering as a means to efficientlycache query results. The general idea is to populate the cache with documents thatcontribute to the result pages of a large number of queries; as opposed to caching the topdocuments for each query. It turns out that the problem is hard and solving it requiresknowledge of the structure of the queries and the results space; as well as knowledge of theinput query distribution. We formulate the problem under the framework of stochasticoptimization; theoretically it can be seen as a stochastic universal version of set multicover.While the problem is NP-hard to be solved exactly; we show that for any distribution it can beapproximated using a simple greedy approach.

Homophily and polarization in the age of misinformation,Alessandro Bessi; Fabio Petroni; Michela Del Vicario; Fabiana Zollo; Aris Anagnostopoulos; Antonio Scala; Guido Caldarelli; Walter Quattrociocchi,Abstract The World Economic Forum listed massive digital misinformation as one of the mainthreats for our society. The spreading of unsubstantiated rumors may have seriousconsequences on public opinion such as in the case of rumors about Ebola causingdisruption to health-care workers. In this work we target Facebook to characterizeinformation consumption patterns of 1.2 M Italian users with respect to verified (sciencenews) and unverified (conspiracy news) contents. Through a thorough quantitative analysiswe provide important insights about the anatomy of the system across which misinformationmight spread. In particular; we show that users' engagement on verified (or unverified)content correlates with the number of friends having similar consumption patterns(homophily).

Inefficiency of games with social context,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Bart De Keijzer; Guido Schäfer,Abstract The study of other-regarding player behavior such as altruism and spite in gameshas recently received quite some attention in the algorithmic game theory literature. Alreadyfor very simple models; it has been shown that altruistic behavior can actually be harmful forsociety in the sense that the price of anarchy may increase as the players become morealtruistic. In this paper; we study the severity of this phenomenon for more realistic settings inwhich there is a complex underlying social structure; causing the players to direct theiraltruistic and spiteful behavior in a refined player-specific sense (depending; for example; onfriendships that exist among the players). Our findings show that the increase in the price ofanarchy is modest for congestion games and minsum scheduling games; whereas it mightbe drastic for generalized second price auctions.,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,7
Stochastic Query Covering for Fast Approximate Document Retrieval,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Ilaria Bordino; Stefano Leonardi; Ida Mele; Piotr Sankowski,Abstract We design algorithms that; given a collection of documents and a distribution overuser queries; return a small subset of the document collection in such a way that we canefficiently provide high-quality answers to user queries using only the selected subset. Thisapproach has applications when space is a constraint or when the query-processing timeincreases significantly with the size of the collection. We study our algorithms through thelens of stochastic analysis and prove that even though they use only a small fraction of theentire collection; they can provide answers to most user queries; achieving a performanceclose to the optimal. To complement our theoretical findings; we experimentally show theversatility of our approach by considering two important cases in the context of Web search.In the first case; we favor the retrieval of documents that are relevant to the query …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2015,6

Online pairing of VoIP conversations,Michail Vlachos; Aris Anagnostopoulos; Olivier Verscheure; S Yu Philip,Abstract This paper answers the following question; given a multiplicity of evolving 1-wayconversations; can a machine or an algorithm discern the conversational pairs in an onlinefashion; without understanding the content of the communications? Our analysis indicatesthat this is possible; and can be achieved just by exploiting the temporal dynamics inherentin a conversation. We also show that our findings are applicable for anonymous andencrypted conversations over VoIP networks. We achieve this by exploiting the aperiodicinter-departure time of VoIP packets; hence trivializing each VoIP stream into a binary time-series; indicating the voice activity of each stream. We propose effective techniques thatprogressively pair conversing parties with high accuracy and in a limited amount of time.

Tour recommendation for groups,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Reem Atassi; Luca Becchetti; Adriano Fazzone; Fabrizio Silvestri,Abstract Consider a group of people who are visiting a major touristic city; such as NY; Paris;or Rome. It is reasonable to assume that each member of the group has his or her owninterests or preferences about places to visit; which in general may differ from those of othermembers. Still; people almost always want to hang out together and so the followingquestion naturally arises: What is the best tour that the group could perform together in thecity? This problem underpins several challenges; ranging from understanding people'sexpected attitudes towards potential points of interest; to modeling and providing good andviable solutions. Formulating this problem is challenging because of multiple competingobjectives. For example; making the entire group as happy as possible in general conflictswith the objective that no member becomes disappointed.

Online network design with outliers,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabrizio Grandoni; Stefano Leonardi; Piotr Sankowski,Abstract In a classical online network design problem; traffic requirements are graduallyrevealed to an algorithm. Each time a new request arrives; the algorithm has to satisfy it byaugmenting the network under construction in a proper way (with no possibility of recovery).In this paper we study a natural generalization of the problems above; where a fraction of therequests (the outliers) can be disregarded. Now; each time a request arrives; the algorithmfirst decides whether to satisfy it or not; and only in the first case it acts accordingly; in theend at least k out of t requests must be selected. We cast three classical network designproblems into this framework; the Online Steiner Tree with Outliers; the Online TSP withOutliers; and the Online Facility Location with Outliers.

The requests are independent andidentically distributed according to an arbitrary distribution on a circle; which is eitherdiscrete or continuous. The cost of serving a request is the distance that a server needs tomove to reach the request. The goal is to minimize the steady-state expected cost inducedby the requests. We study the performance of a greedy strategy; focusing; in particular; on itsconvergence properties and the interplay between the discrete and continuous versions ofthe process.,21st International Meeting on Probabilistic; Combinatorial; and Asymptotic Methods in the Analysis of Algorithms (AofA'10),2010,5

The idea is to recommend tweets that are not visible to the user (ie; they do notappear in the user timeline) because nobody in her social circles published or retweetedthem. To do that; we create the user's ego-network up to depth two and apply the transitivityproperty of the friends-of-friends relationship to determine interesting recommendations;which are then ranked to best match the user's interests.

Community Detection on Evolving Graphs,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Jakub Łącki; Silvio Lattanzi; Stefano Leonardi; Mohammad Mahdian,Abstract Clustering is a fundamental step in many information-retrieval and data-miningapplications. Detecting clusters in graphs is also a key tool for finding the communitystructure in social and behavioral networks. In many of these applications; the input graphevolves over time in a continual and decentralized manner; and; to maintain a goodclustering; the clustering algorithm needs to repeatedly probe the graph. Furthermore; thereare often limitations on the frequency of such probes; either imposed explicitly by the onlineplatform (eg; in the case of crawling proprietary social networks like twitter) or implicitlybecause of resource limitations (eg; in the case of crawling the web). In this paper; we studya model of clustering on evolving graphs that captures this aspect of the problem. Our modelis based on the classical stochastic block model; which has been used to assess …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2016,3
A Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm for Co-clustering.,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Anirban Dasgupta; Ravi Kumar,Abstract: Co-clustering is the simultaneous partitioning of the rows and columns of a matrixsuch that the blocks induced by the row/column partitions are good clusters. Motivated byseveral applications in text mining; market-basket analysis; and bioinformatics; this problemhas attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. Unfortunately; to date; most of thealgorithmic work on this problem has been heuristic in nature. In this work we obtain the firstapproximation algorithms for the co-clustering problem. Our algorithms are simple andprovide constant-factor approximations to the optimum. We also show that co-clustering isNP-hard; thereby complementing our algorithmic result.,Theory OF Computing,2012,3
Targeted Interest-Driven Advertising in Cities Using Twitter.,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabio Petroni; Mara Sorella,Abstract Targeted advertising is a key characteristic of online as well as traditional-mediamarketing. However; it is very limited in outdoor advertising; that is; performing campaignsby means of billboards in public places. In this work we propose a methodology forperforming targeted outdoor advertising by leveraging the use of social media. In particular;we use the Twitter social network to gather information about users' degree of interest ingiven advertising categories and about the routes that they follow. Given an advertisingcategory; we estimate the most promising areas to be selected for the placement of an adthat can maximize its targeted effectiveness.,ICWSM,2016,2
Bidding Strategies for Fantasy-Sports Auctions,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Ruggiero Cavallo; Stefano Leonardi; Maxim Sviridenko,Abstract Fantasy sports is a fast-growing; multi-billion dollar industry [10] in whichcompetitors assemble virtual teams of athletes from real professional sports leagues andobtain points based on the statistical performance of those athletes in actual games. Users(team managers) can add; drop; and trade players throughout the season; but the pivotalevent is the player draft that initiates the competition. One common drafting mechanism isthe so-called auction draft: managers bid on athletes in rounds until all positions on eachroster have been filled. Managers start with the same initial virtual budget and take turnssuccessively nominating athletes to be auctioned; with the winner of each round making avirtual payment that diminishes his budget for future rounds. Each manager tries to obtainplayers that maximize the expected performance of his own team. In this paper we initiate …,International Conference on Web and Internet Economics,2016,1
Online Network Design with Outliers,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabrizio Grandoni; Stefano Leonardi; Piotr Sankowski,Abstract In a classical online network design problem; traffic requirements are graduallyrevealed to an algorithm. Each time a new request arrives; the algorithm has to satisfy it byaugmenting the network under construction in a proper way (with no possibility of recovery).In this paper we study a natural generalization of online network design problems; where afraction of the requests (the outliers) can be disregarded. Now; each time a request arrives;the algorithm first decides whether to satisfy it or not; and only in the first case it actsaccordingly. We cast three classical network design problems into this framework:(i) OnlineSteiner tree with outliers In this case a set of t terminals that belong to an n-node graph ispresented; one at a time; to an algorithm. Each time a new terminal arrives; the algorithmcan either discard or select it. In the latter case; the algorithm connects it to the Steiner …,Algorithmica,2016,1
Learning a Macroscopic Model of Cultural Dynamics,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Mara Sorella,A fundamental open question that has been studied by sociologists since the 70s andrecently started being addressed by the computer-science community is the understandingof the role that influence and selection play in shaping the evolution of socio-culturalsystems. Quantifying these forces in real settings is still a big challenge; especially in thelarge-scale case in which the entire social network between the users may not be known;and only longitudinal data in terms of masses of cultural groups (eg; political affiliation;product adoption; market share; cultural tastes) may be available. We propose an influenceand selection model encompassing an explicit characterization of the feature space for thedifferent cultural groups in the form of a natural equation-based macroscopic model;following the approach of Kempe et al.[EC 2013]. Our main goal is to estimate edge …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,1
Competitive influence in social networks: Convergence; submodularity; and competition effects,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Diodato Ferraioli; Stefano Leonardi,Abstract In the last 10 years; a vast amount of scientific literature has studied the problem ofinfluence maximization. Yet; only very recently have scientists started considering the morerealistic case in which competing entities try to expand their market and maximize theirshare via viral marketing. Goyal and Kearns [STOC 2012] present a model for the diffusion oftwo competing alternatives in a social network; which consists of two phases: one for theactivation; in which nodes choose whether to adopt any of the two alternatives or none ofthem; and one for the selection; which is for choosing which of the two alternatives to adopt.In this work we consider this two-phase model; by composing some of the most knowndynamics (threshold; voter; and logit models); and we ask the following questions:(1) How isthe stationary distribution of the composition of these dynamics related to those of the …,Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,2015,1

A Mazing 2+ eps Approximation for Unsplittable Flow on a Path,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabrizio Grandoni; Stefano Leonardi; Andreas Wiese,Abstract: We study the unsplittable flow on a path problem (UFP) where we are given a pathwith non-negative edge capacities and tasks; which are characterized by a subpath; ademand; and a profit. The goal is to find the most profitable subset of tasks whose totaldemand does not violate the edge capacities. This problem naturally arises in many settingssuch as bandwidth allocation; resource constrained scheduling; and interval packing. Anatural task classification defines the size of a task i to be the ratio delta between thedemand of i and the minimum capacity of any edge used by i. If all tasks have sufficientlysmall delta; the problem is already well understood and there is a 1+ eps approximation. Forthe complementary setting---instances whose tasks all have large delta---much remainsunknown; and the best known polynomial-time procedure gives only (for any constant …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.2670,2012,1
Probabilistic Analysis of the k-Server Problem on the Circle,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Clément Dombry; Nadine Guillotin-Plantard; Ioannis Kontoyiannis; Eli Upfal,Abstract We consider a stochastic version of the k-server problem; in which k servers moveon a circle to satisfy randomly generated requests. The requests are independent andidentically distributed; according to an arbitrary distribution that is either discrete orcontinuous. The cost of serving a request is the distance that a server needs to travel inorder to reach the request. The goal is to minimize the steady-state expected cost inducedby the sequence of requests. We study the performance of a greedy strategy focusing; inparticular; on its convergence properties and the interplay between the discrete andcontinuous versions of the process. Finally; we show that in the case of k= 2 servers thegreedy policy is optimal.,21st International Meeting on Probabilistic; Combinatorial and Asymptotic Methods for the Analysis of Algorithms (AofA 2010),2010,1
The advantage of balanced-allocation routing for ATM networks,A Anagnostopoulos; I Kontoyiannis; E Upfal,We compare the long-term; steady-state performance of a variant of the standard dynamicalternative routing (DAR) technique commonly used in telephone and ATM networks; to theperformance of a path-selection algorithm based on the" balanced-allocation" principle; werefer to this new algorithm as the balanced dynamic alternative routing (BDAR) algorithm.We show that; at the expense of a minor increase in routing overhead; the BDAR algorithmgives a substantial improvement in network performance; in terms both of networkcongestion and of bandwidth requirement.,Information Theory; 2003.

A Mazing 2 ε Approximation for Unsplittable Flow on,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Fabrizio Grandoni; Stefano Leonardi; Andreas Wiese,Abstract We study the unsplittable flow on a path problem (UFP); which arises naturally inmany applications such as bandwidth allocation; job scheduling; and caching. Here we aregiven a path with nonnegative edge capacities and a set of tasks; which are characterizedby a subpath; a demand; and a profit. The goal is to find the most profitable subset of taskswhose total demand does not violate the edge capacities. Not surprisingly; this problem hasreceived a lot of attention in the research community. If the demand of each task is at most asmall enough fraction δ of the capacity along its subpath (δ-small tasks); then it has beenknown for a long time [Chekuri et al.; ICALP 2003] how to compute a solution of valuearbitrarily close to the optimum via LP rounding. However; much remains unknown for thecomplementary case; that is; when the demand of each task is at least some fraction δ> 0 …,*,*,*
