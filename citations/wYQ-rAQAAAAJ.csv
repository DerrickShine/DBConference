The sharing economy: Why people participate in collaborative consumption,Juho Hamari; Mimmi Sjöklint; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have enabled the rise of so-called “Collaborative Consumption”(CC): the peer-to-peer-based activity of obtaining; giving;or sharing the access to goods and services; coordinated through community-based onlineservices. CC has been expected to alleviate societal problems such as hyper-consumption;pollution; and poverty by lowering the cost of economic coordination within communities.However; beyond anecdotal evidence; there is a dearth of understanding why peopleparticipate in CC. Therefore; in this article we investigate people's motivations to participatein CC. The study employs survey data (N= 168) gathered from people registered onto a CCsite. The results show that participation in CC is motivated by many factors such as itssustainability; enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains.

Web search queries can predict stock market volumes,Ilaria Bordino; Stefano Battiston; Guido Caldarelli; Matthieu Cristelli; Antti Ukkonen; Ingmar Weber,We live in a computerized and networked society where many of our actions leave a digitaltrace and affect other people's actions. This has lead to the emergence of a new data-drivenresearch field: mathematical methods of computer science; statistical physics andsociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science tohuman mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (ie; the number ofrequests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and; insome cases; to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples includeunemployment levels; car and home sales; and epidemics spreading. Few recent worksapplied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However; it remains unclear iftrends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on …,PloS one,2012,159
Sparsification of influence networks,Michael Mathioudakis; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We present Spine; an efficient algorithm for finding the" backbone" of an influencenetwork. Given a social graph and a log of past propagations; we build an instance of theindependent-cascade model that describes the propagations. We aim at reducing thecomplexity of that model; while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data. Weshow that the problem is inapproximable and we present an optimal; dynamic-programmingalgorithm; whose search space; albeit exponential; is typically much smaller than that of thebrute force; exhaustive-search approach.

Overlapping correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,We introduce a new approach to the problem of overlapping clustering. The main idea is toformulate overlapping clustering as an optimization problem in which each data point ismapped to a small set of labels; representing membership to different clusters. The objectiveis to find a mapping so that the distances between data points agree as much as possiblewith distances taken over their label sets. To define distances between label sets; weconsider two measures: a set-intersection indicator function and the Jaccard coefficient. Tosolve the main optimization problem we propose a local-search algorithm. The iterative stepof our algorithm requires solving non-trivial optimization sub problems; which; for themeasures of set-intersection and Jaccard; we solve using a greedy method and non-negative least squares; respectively. Since our frameworks uses pair wise similarities of …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,51
Csi: Community-level social influence analysis,Yasir Mehmood; Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Modeling how information propagates in social networks driven by peer influence;is a fundamental research question towards understanding the structure and dynamics ofthese complex networks; as well as developing viral marketing applications. Existingliterature studies influence at the level of individuals; mostly ignoring the existence of acommunity structure in which multiple nodes may exhibit a common influence pattern. In thispaper we introduce CSI; a model for analyzing information propagation and social influenceat the granularity of communities. CSI builds over a novel propagation model thatgeneralizes the classic Independent Cascade model to deal with groups of nodes (insteadof single nodes) influence. Given a social network and a database of past informationpropagation; we propose a hierarchical approach to detect a set of communities and their …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,44
Chromatic correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Charalampos E Tsourakakis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We study a novel clustering problem in which the pairwise relations betweenobjects are categorical. This problem can be viewed as clustering the vertices of a graphwhose edges are of different types (colors). We introduce an objective function that ensuresthe edges within each cluster have; as much as possible; the same color. We show that theproblem is NP-hard and propose a randomized algorithm with approximation guaranteeproportional to the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm iteratively picks arandom edge as a pivot; builds a cluster around it; and removes the cluster from the graph.Although being fast; easy to implement; and parameter-free; this algorithm tends to producea relatively large number of clusters. To overcome this issue we introduce a variantalgorithm; which modifies how the pivot is chosen and how the cluster is built around the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,42
The crowd-median algorithm,Hannes Heikinheimo; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract The power of human computation is founded on the capabilities of humans toprocess qualitative information in a manner that is hard to reproduce with a computer.However; all machine learning algorithms rely on mathematical operations; such as sums;averages; least squares etc. that are less suitable for human computation. This paper is aneffort to combine these two aspects of data processing. We consider the problem ofcomputing a centroid of a data set; a key component in many data-analysis applicationssuch as clustering; using a very simple human intelligence task (HIT). In this task the workersmust choose the outlier from a set of three items. After presenting a number of such triplets tothe workers; the item chosen the least number of times as the outlier is selected as thecentroid. We provide a proof that the centroid determined by this procedure is equal the …,First AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing,2013,30
Answers; not links: extracting tips from yahoo! answers to address how-to web queries,Ingmar Weber; Antti Ukkonen; Aris Gionis,Abstract We investigate the problem of mining" tips" from Yahoo! Answers and displayingthose tips in response to related web queries. Here; a" tip" is a short; concrete and self-contained bit of non-obvious advice such as" To zest a lime if you don't have a zester: use acheese grater." First; we estimate the volume of web queries with" how-to" intent; whichcould be potentially addressed by a tip. Second; we analyze how to detect such queriesautomatically without solely relying on literal" how to*" patterns. Third; we describe how toderive potential tips automatically from Yahoo! Answers; and we develop machine-learningtechniques to remove low-quality tips. Finally; we discuss how to match web queries with"how-to" intent to tips. We evaluate both the quality of these direct displays as well as the sizeof the query volume that can be addressed by serving tips.,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,30
Algorithms for discovering bucket orders from data,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Kai Puolamäki; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Ordering and ranking items of different types are important tasks in variousapplications; such as query processing and scientific data mining. A total order for the itemscan be misleading; since there are groups of items that have practically equal ranks. Weconsider bucket orders; ie; total orders with ties. They can be used to capture the essentialorder information without overfitting the data: they form a useful concept class between totalorders and arbitrary partial orders. We address the question of finding a bucket order for aset of items; given pairwise precedence information between the items. We also discussmethods for computing the pairwise precedence data. We describe simple and efficientalgorithms for finding good bucket orders. Several of the algorithms have a provableapproximation guarantee; and they scale well to large datasets.

Searching the wikipedia with contextual information,Antti Ukkonen; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We propose a framework for searching the Wikipedia with contextual information.Our framework extends the typical keyword search; by considering queries of the type (q; p);where q is a set of terms (as in classical Web search); and p is a source Wikipediadocument. The query terms q represent the information that the user is interested in finding;and the document p provides the context of the query. The task is to rank other documents inWikipedia with respect to their relevance to the query terms q given the context document p.By associating a context to the query terms; the search results of a search initiated in aparticular page can be made more relevant. We suggest a number of features that extendthe classical query-search model so that the context document p is considered. We then useRankSVM (Joachims 2002) to learn weights for the individual features given suitably …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,27
Multiview triplet embedding: Learning attributes in multiple maps,Ehsan Amid; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract For humans; it is usually easier to make statements about the similarity of objects inrelative; rather than absolute terms. Moreover; subjective comparisons of objects can bebased on a number of different and independent attributes. For example; objects can becompared based on their shape; color; etc. In this paper; we consider the problem ofuncovering these hidden attributes given a set of relative distance judgments in the form oftriplets. The attribute that was used to generate a particular triplet in this set is unknown.Such data occurs; eg; in crowdsourcing applications where the triplets are collected from alarge group of workers. We propose the Multiview Triplet Embedding (MVTE) algorithm thatproduces a number of low-dimensional maps; each corresponding to one of the hiddenattributes. The method can be used to assess how many different attributes were used to …,International Conference on Machine Learning,2015,24
Finding partial orders from unordered 0-1 data,Antti Ukkonen; Mikael Fortelius; Heikki Mannila,Abstract In applications such as paleontology and medical genetics the 0-1 data has anunderlying unknown order (the ages of the fossil sites; the locations of markers in thegenome). The order might be total or partial: for example; two sites in different parts of theglobe might be ecologically incomparable; or the ordering of certain markers might bedifferent in different subgroups of the data. We consider the following problem. Given a tableover a set of 0-1 variables; find a partial order for the rows minimizing a score function andbeing as specific as possible. The score function can be; eg; the number of changes from 1to 0 in a column (for paleontology) or the likelihood of the marker sequence (for genomicdata). Our solution for this task first constructs small totally ordered fragments of the partialorder; then finds good orientations for the fragments; and finally uses a simple and …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,21
Discovering skylines of subgroup sets,Matthijs Van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Many tasks in exploratory data mining aim to discover the top-k results with respectto a certain interestingness measure. Unfortunately; in practice top-k solution sets are hardlysatisfactory; if only because redundancy in such results is a severe problem. To address this;a recent trend is to find diverse sets of high-quality patterns. However; a 'perfect'diverse top-kcannot possibly exist; since there is an inherent trade-off between quality and diversity. Weargue that the best way to deal with the quality-diversity trade-off is to explicitly consider thePareto front; or skyline; of non-dominated solutions; ie those solutions for which neitherquality nor diversity can be improved without degrading the other quantity. In particular; wefocus on k-pattern set mining in the context of Subgroup Discovery [6]. For this setting; wepresent two algorithms for the discovery of skylines; an exact algorithm and a levelwise …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,18
Distance oracles in edge-labeled graphs.,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Antti Ukkonen,ABSTRACT A fundamental operation over edge-labeled graphs is the computation ofshortest-path distances subject to a constraint on the set of permissible edge labels.Applying exact algorithms for such an operation is not a viable option; especially for massivegraphs; or in scenarios where the distance computation is used as a primitive for morecomplex computations. In this paper we study the problem of efficient approximation ofshortest-path queries with edge-label constraints; for which we devise two indexes based onthe idea of landmarks: distances from all vertices of the graph to a selected subset oflandmark vertices are pre-computed and then used at query time to efficiently approximatedistance queries. The major challenge to face is that; in principle; an exponential number ofconstraint label sets needs to be stored for each vertex-landmark pair; which makes the …,EDBT,2014,14
Activity preserving graph simplification,Francesco Bonchi; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We study the problem of simplifying a given directed graph by keeping a smallsubset of its arcs. Our goal is to maintain the connectivity required to explain a set ofobserved traces of information propagation across the graph. Unlike previous work; we donot make any assumption about an underlying model of information propagation. Instead;we approach the task as a combinatorial problem. We prove that the resulting optimizationproblem is NP NP-hard. We show that a standard greedy algorithm performs very well inpractice; even though it does not have theoretical guarantees. Additionally; if the activitytraces have a tree structure; we show that the objective function is supermodular; andexperimentally verify that the approach for size-constrained submodular minimizationrecently proposed by Nagano et al.(28th International Conference on Machine Learning …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2013,12
Clustering algorithms for chains,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We consider the problem of clustering a set of chains to k clusters. A chain is atotally ordered subset of a finite set of items. Chains are an intuitive way to expresspreferences over a set of alternatives; as well as a useful representation of ratings insituations where the item-specific scores are either difficult to obtain; too noisy due tomeasurement error; or simply not as relevant as the order that they induce over the items.First we adapt the classical k-means for chains by proposing a suitable distance functionand a centroid structure. We also present two different approaches for mapping chains to avector space. The first one is related to the planted partition model; while the second onehas an intuitive geometrical interpretation. Finally we discuss a randomization test forassessing the significance of a clustering. To this end we present an MCMC algorithm for …,Journal of Machine Learning Research,2011,10

Bump hunting in the dark: Local discrepancy maximization on graphs,Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis; Antti Ukkonen,We study the problem of discrepancy maximization on graphs: given a set of nodes Q of anunderlying graph G; we aim to identify a connected subgraph of G that contains many morenodes from Q than other nodes. This variant of the discrepancy maximization problemextends the well-known notion of “bump hunting” in the Euclidean space [1]. We considerthe problem under two access models. In the unrestricted-access model; the whole graph Gis given as input; while in the local-access model we can only retrieve the neighbors of agiven node in G using a possibly slow and costly interface. We prove that the basic problemof discrepancy maximization on graphs is NP-hard; and empirically evaluate theperformance of four heuristics for solving it. For the local-access model; we consider threedifferent algorithms that aim to recover a part of G large enough to contain an optimal …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,9
Visualizing sets of partial rankings,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Partial rankings are totally ordered subsets of a set of items. They arise in differentapplications; such as clickstream analysis and collaborative filtering; but can be difficult toanalyze with traditional data analysis techniques as they are combinatorial structures. Wepropose a method for creating scatterplots of sets of partial rankings by first representingthem in a high-dimensional space and then applying known dimensionality reductionmethods. We compare different approaches by using quantitative measures anddemonstrate the methods on real data sets from different application domains. Despite theirsimplicity the proposed methods can produce useful visualizations that are easy to interpret.,International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis,2007,9
Crowdsourced nonparametric density estimation using relative distances,Antti Ukkonen; Behrouz Derakhshan; Hannes Heikinheimo,Abstract In this paper we address the following density estimation problem: given a numberof relative similarity judgements over a set of items D; assign a density value p (x) to eachitem x in D. Our work is motivated by human computing applications where density can beinterpreted eg as a measure of the rarity of an item. While humans are excellent at solving arange of different visual tasks; assessing absolute similarity (or distance) of two items (egphotographs) is difficult. Relative judgements of similarity; such as A is more similar to B thanto C; on the other hand; are substantially easier to elicit from people. We provide two novelmethods for density estimation that only use relative expressions of similarity. We give boththeoretical justifications; as well as empirical evidence that the proposed methods producegood estimates.,Third AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing,2015,8
Feature selection in taxonomies with applications to paleontology,Gemma C Garriga; Antti Ukkonen; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Taxonomies for a set of features occur in many real-world domains. An example isprovided by paleontology; where the task is to determine the age of a fossil site on the basisof the taxa that have been found in it. As the fossil record is very noisy and there are lots ofgaps in it; the challenge is to consider taxa at a suitable level of aggregation: species;genus; family; etc. For example; some species can be very suitable as features for the ageprediction task; while for other parts of the taxonomy it would be better to use genus level oreven higher levels of the hierarchy. A default choice is to select a fixed level (typicallyspecies or genus); this misses the potential gain of choosing the proper level for sets ofspecies separately. Motivated by this application we study the problem of selecting anantichain from a taxonomy that covers all leaves and helps to predict better a specified …,International Conference on Discovery Science,2008,8
A kernel-learning approach to semi-supervised clustering with relative distance comparisons,Ehsan Amid; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We consider the problem of clustering a given dataset into k clusters subject to anadditional set of constraints on relative distance comparisons between the data items. Theadditional constraints are meant to reflect side-information that is not expressed in thefeature vectors; directly. Relative comparisons can express structures at finer level of detailthan must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints that are commonly used for semi-supervised clustering. Relative comparisons are particularly useful in settings where givingan ML or a CL constraint is difficult because the granularity of the true clustering is unknown.Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for learning a kernel matrix using the logdeterminant divergence (a variant of the Bregman divergence) subject to a set of relativedistance constraints. Given the learned kernel matrix; a clustering can be obtained by any …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2015,7
Characterizing uncertain data using compression,Francesco Bonchi; Matthijs van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Motivated by sensor networks; mobility data; biology and life sciences; the area ofmining uncertain data has recently received a great deal of attention. While various papershave focused on efficiently mining frequent patterns from uncertain data; the problem ofdiscovering a small set of interesting patterns that provide an accurate and condenseddescription of a probabilistic database is still unexplored. In this paper we study the problemof discovering characteristic patterns in uncertain data through information theoretic lenses.Adopting the possible worlds interpretation of probabilistic data and a compression schemebased on the MDL principle; we formalize the problem of mining patterns that compress thedatabase well in expectation. Despite its huge search space; we show that this problem canbe accurately approximated. In particular; we devise a sequence of three methods where …,*,2011,7
Finding outlying items in sets of partial rankings,Antti Ukkonen; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Partial rankings are totally ordered subsets of a set of items. For example; thesequence in which a user browses through different parts of a website is a partial ranking.We consider the following problem. Given a set D of partial rankings; find items that havestrongly different status in different parts of D. To do this; we first compute a clustering of Dand then look at items whose average rank in the cluster substantially deviates from itsaverage rank in D. Such items can be seen as those that contribute the most to thedifferences between the clusters. To test the statistical significance of the found items; wepropose a method that is based on a MCMC algorithm for sampling random sets of partialrankings with exactly the same statistics as D. We also demonstrate the method on movierankings and gene expression data.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2007,7
Indirect estimation of shortest path distributions with small-world experiments,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract The distribution of shortest path lenghts is a useful characterisation of theconnectivity in a network. The small-world experiment is a classical way to study the shortestpath distribution in real-world social networks that cannot be directly observed. However; thedata observed in these experiments are distorted by two factors: attrition and routing (in)efficiency. This leads to inaccuracies in the estimates of shortest path lenghts. In this paperwe propose a model to analyse small-world experiments that corrects for both of theaforementioned sources of bias. Under suitable circumstances the model gives accurateestimates of the true underlying shortest path distribution without directly observing thenetwork. It can also quantify the routing efficiency of the underlying population. We study themodel by using simulations; and apply it to real data from previous small-world …,International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis,2014,6
Fast estimation of the pattern frequency spectrum,Matthijs Van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Both exact and approximate counting of the number of frequent patterns for a givenfrequency threshold are hard problems. Still; having even coarse prior estimates of thenumber of patterns is useful; as these can be used to appropriately set the threshold andavoid waiting endlessly for an unmanageable number of patterns. Moreover; we argue thatthe number of patterns for different thresholds is an interesting summary statistic of the data:the pattern frequency spectrum. To enable fast estimation of the number of frequent patterns;we adapt the classical algorithm by Knuth for estimating the size of a search tree. Althoughthe method is known to be theoretically suboptimal; we demonstrate that in practice it notonly produces very accurate estimates; but is also very efficient. Moreover; we introduce asmall variation that can be used to estimate the number of patterns under constraints for …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2014,6
Algorithms for finding orders and analyzing sets of chains,Antti Ukkonen,Rankings of items are a useful concept in a variety of applications; such as clickstreamanalysis; some voting methods; bioinformatics; and other fields of science such aspaleontology. This thesis addresses two problems related to such data. The first problem isabout finding orders; while the second one is about analyzing sets of orders. We addresstwo different tasks in the problem of finding orders. We can find orders either by computingan aggregate of a set of known orders; or by constructing an order for a previouslyunordered data set. For the first task we show that bucket orders; a subclass of partial orders;are a useful structure for summarizing sets of orders. We formulate an optimization problemfor finding such partial orders; show that it is NP-hard; and give an efficient randomizedalgorithm for finding approximate solutions to it. Moreover; we show that the expected …,*,2008,5
Data mining techniques for discovering partial orders,Antti Ukkonen,The problem of discovering several partial orders is solved by first finding such a partition ofS that orders generated by the same partial order reside in the same member of the partition.Finally greedy-orderis applied to every member of the partition. Two methods for obtainingthe partition are presented. The first alternative is based on computing frequent closeditemsets of a database that represents S and solving a set cover problem using the supportsof these itemsets. The second alternative is based on a local search of all possible partitions.The search is guided by a score function that is maximized either by a hill climbing algorithmor Simulated Annealing.,Master's thesis;(Helsinki University of Technology; Helsinki; 2004),2004,4
Navigating complex information spaces: a portfolio theory approach,Payel Bandyopadhyay; Tuukka Ruotsalo; Antti Ukkonen; Giulio Jacucci,Abstract Users often find difficult to navigate through a large information space to find therequired information. One of the reasons is the difficulty in designing systems that wouldpresent the user with an optimal set of navigation options to support varying informationneeds. As a solution; this paper proposes a method referred as interaction portfolio theory.This theory is inspired by the economic theory called the “Modern Portfolio theory”; whichoffers users with optimal interaction options by taking into account user's goal expressed viainteraction during the task; but also the risk related to a potentially suboptimal choice madeby the user. The proposed method learns the relevant interaction options from user behaviorinteractively and optimizes relevance and diversity to allow the user to accomplish the taskin a shorter interaction sequence. This theory can be applied to any IR system to help …,International Workshop on Symbiotic Interaction,2014,3
Multivariate confidence intervals,Jussi Korpela; Emilia Oikarinen; Kai Puolamäki; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Confidence intervals are a popular way to visualize and analyze data distributions.Unlike p-values; they can convey information both about statistical significance as well aseffect size. However; very little work exists on applying confidence intervals to multivariatedata. In this paper we define confidence intervals for multivariate data that extend the one-dimensional definition in a natural way. In our definition every variable is associated with itsown confidence interval as usual; but a data vector can be outside of a few of these; and stillbe considered to be within the confidence area. We analyze the problem and show that theresulting confidence areas retain the good qualities of their one-dimensional counterparts:they are informative and easy to interpret. Furthermore; we show that the problem of findingmultivariate confidence intervals is hard; but provide efficient approximate algorithms to …,*,2017,2

We set out to investigate the features of chat messagesin this particular kind of environment; assessing the amount of threading; defined in terms ofmessage content contributing to one topic; and conversation; based on patterns ininformational and emotional functions of subsequent messages. We observe that our casesare characterized with a high level of threading; even while the application did nottechnically support it. Furthermore; we observe patterns that demonstrate these threadswere conversations; based on the types of responses in each thread. Based on our findings;we propose that technical tools for public event-based chats can support conversations andsuggest that better tools for this should be developed.,Computers in Human Behavior,2015,2
Same bang; fewer bucks: efficient discovery of the cost-influence skyline,Matthijs van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Influence maximization aims to find a set of persons in a social network that can beused as seeds for a viral marketing campaign; such that the expected spread of influence ismaximized. Standard approaches to this problem produce a single seed set that eithermaximizes influence; or the “bang for the buck” if the vertices are associated with a cost. Inthis paper we consider the problem of finding the cost-influence skyline; ie; the collection ofall seed sets that are Pareto optimal wrt seeding cost and expected influence. Computingthe cost-influence skyline has a number of advantages over finding a single solution only.First; it provides a better understanding of the trade-off between cost and influence; whichenables the user to make an informed choice regarding the budget. Second; by computingthe cost-influence skyline we obtain the optimal seed set for any given seeding budget …,*,2015,2
Example-dependent basis vector selection for kernel-based classifiers,Antti Ukkonen; Marta Arias,Abstract We study methods for speeding up classification time of kernel-based classifiers.Existing solutions are based on explicitly seeking sparse classifiers during training; or byusing budgeted versions of the classifier where one directly limits the number of basisvectors allowed. Here; we propose a more flexible alternative: instead of using the samebasis vectors over the whole feature space; our solution uses different basis vectors indifferent parts of the feature space. At the core of our solution lies an optimization procedurethat; given a set of basis vectors; finds a good partition of the feature space and goodsubsets of the existing basis vectors. Using this procedure repeatedly; we build trees whoseinternal nodes specify feature space partitions and whose leaves implement simple kernelclassifiers. Experiments suggest that our method reduces classification time significantly …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2010,2
The support vector tree,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Kernel based methods; such as nonlinear support vector machines; have a highclassification accuracy in many applications. But classification using these methods can beslow if the kernel function is complex and if it has to be evaluated many times. Existingsolutions to this problem try to find a representation of the decision surface in terms of only afew basis vectors; so that only a small number of kernel evaluations is needed. However; inall of these methods the set of basis vectors used is independent of the example to beclassified. In this paper we propose to adaptively select a small number of basis vectorsgiven an unseen example. The set of basis vectors is thus not fixed; but it depends on theinput to the classifier. Our approach is to first learn a non-sparse kernel machine using someexisting techique; and then using training data to find a function that maps unseen …,*,2010,2
Crowdsourced correlation clustering with relative distance comparisons,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract: Crowdsourced; or human computation based clustering algorithms usually rely onrelative distance comparisons; as these are easier to elicit from human workers thanabsolute distance information. A relative distance comparison is a statement of the form"item A is closer to item B than to item C". However; many existing clustering algorithms thatuse relative distances are rather complex. They are often based on a two-step approach;where the relative distances are first used to learn either a distance matrix; or an embeddingof the items; and then some standard clustering method is applied in a second step. In thispaper we argue that it should be possible to compute a clustering directly from relativedistance comparisons. Our ideas are built upon existing work on correlation clustering; awell-known non-parametric approach to clustering. The technical contribution of this work …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.08459,2017,1
Interpreting Classifiers through Attribute Interactions in Datasets,Andreas Henelius; Kai Puolamäki; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract: In this work we present the novel ASTRID method for investigating which attributeinteractions classifiers exploit when making predictions. Attribute interactions inclassification tasks mean that two or more attributes together provide stronger evidence for aparticular class label. Knowledge of such interactions makes models more interpretable byrevealing associations between attributes. This has applications; eg; in pharmacovigilanceto identify interactions between drugs or in bioinformatics to investigate associationsbetween single nucleotide polymorphisms. We also show how the found attributepartitioning is related to a factorisation of the data generating distribution and empiricallydemonstrate the utility of the proposed method.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.07576,2017,1

Therelative-distance constraints used in this work are particularly effective in expressingstructures at finer level of detail than must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints; whichare most commonly used for semi-supervised clustering. Relative-distance constraints arethus useful in settings where providing an ML or a CL constraint is difficult because thegranularity of the true clustering is unknown. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithmfor learning a kernel matrix using the log determinant divergence---a variant of the Bregmandivergence---subject to a set of relative-distance constraints.

Expect the unexpected–on the significance of subgroups,Matthijs van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Within the field of exploratory data mining; subgroup discovery is concerned withfinding regions in the data that stand out with respect to a particular target. An importantquestion is how to validate the patterns found; how do we distinguish a true finding from afalse discovery? A common solution is to apply a statistical significance test that states that apattern is real iff it is different from a random subset. In this paper we argue and empiricallyshow that this assumption is often too weak; as almost any realistic pattern languagespecifies a set of subsets that strongly deviates from random subsets. In particular; ouranalysis shows that one should expect the unexpected in subgroup discovery: given adataset and corresponding description language; it is very likely that high-quality subgroupscan—and hence will—be found.,International Conference on Discovery Science,2016,1
Mining local correlation patterns in sets of sequences,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Given a set of (possibly infinite) sequences; we consider the problem of detectingevents where a subset of the sequences is correlated for a short period. In other words; wewant to find cases where a number of the sequences output exactly the same substring atthe same time. Such substrings; together with the sequences in which they are contained;form a local correlation pattern. In practice we only want to find patterns that are longer thanγ and appear in at least σ sequences. Our main contribution is an algorithm for mining suchpatterns in an online case; where the sequences are read in parallel one symbol at a time(no random access) and the patterns must be reported as soon as they occur. We conductexperiments on both artificial and real data. The results show that the proposed algorithmscales well as the number of sequences increases. We also conduct a case study using a …,International Conference on Discovery Science,2009,1
Large-scale study of social network structure and team performance in a multiplayer online game,Antti Ukkonen; Juho Hamari,Abstract: A question of interest in both theory and practice is if and how familiarity betweenmembers of a team; expressed in terms of social network structure; relates to the success ofthe team in a given task. In this paper we revisit this important question in a novel manner byemploying game outcome statistics from Dota 2; a popular team-based multiplayer onlinegame; combined with network data from Steam Community; a social networking service forgamers. We conduct a large-scale analysis of 4168 teams to study how network density; andthe minimum and maximum degree of the within-team social network are associated withteam performance; and determine how this association is moderated by team skill. Weobserve that minimum degree is strongly associated with good performance; especially inteams with lower skill. Together with previous results on network density that we …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.11507,2017,*
Explaining Deviating Subsets through Explanation Networks,Antti Ukkonen; Vladimir Dzyuba; Matthijs van Leeuwen,Abstract We propose a novel approach to finding explanations of deviating subsets; oftencalled subgroups. Existing approaches for subgroup discovery rely on various qualitymeasures that nonetheless often fail to find subgroup sets that are diverse; of high quality;and most importantly; provide good explanations of the deviations that occur in the data. Totackle this issue we introduce explanation networks; which provide a holistic view on allcandidate subgroups and how they relate to each other; offering elegant ways to select high-quality yet diverse subgroup sets. Explanation networks are constructed by representingsubgroups by nodes and having weighted edges represent the extent to which onesubgroup explains another. Explanatory strength is defined by extending ideas fromdatabase causality; in which interventions are used to quantify the effect of one query on …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2017,*
Finding Statistically Significant Attribute Interactions,Andreas Henelius; Antti Ukkonen; Kai Puolamäki,Abstract: In many data exploration tasks it is meaningful to identify groups of attributeinteractions that are specific to a variable of interest. These interactions are also useful inseveral practical applications; for example; to gain insight into the structure of the data; infeature selection; and in data anonymisation. We present a novel method; based onstatistical significance testing; that can be used to verify if the data set has been created by agiven factorized class-conditional joint distribution; where the distribution is parametrized bypartition of its attributes. Furthermore; we provide a method; named ASTRID; to automaticallyfind a partition of attributes that describes the distribution that has generated the data. Thestate-of-the-art classifiers are utilized to capture the interactions present in the data bysystematically breaking attribute interactions and observing the effect of this breaking on …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.07597,2016,*
Semigeometric Tiling of Event Sequences,Andreas Henelius; Isak Karlsson; Panagiotis Papapetrou; Antti Ukkonen; Kai Puolamäki,Abstract Event sequences are ubiquitous; eg; in finance; medicine; and social media. Oftenthe same underlying phenomenon; such as television advertisements during Superbowl; isreflected in independent event sequences; like different Twitter users. It is hence of interestto find combinations of temporal segments and subsets of sequences where an event ofinterest; like a particular hashtag; has an increased occurrence probability. Such patternsallow exploration of the event sequences in terms of their evolving temporal dynamics; andprovide more fine-grained insights to the data than what for example straightforwardclustering can reveal. We formulate the task of finding such patterns as a novel matrix tilingproblem; and propose two algorithms for solving it. Our first algorithm is a greedy set-coverheuristic; while in the second approach we view the problem as time-series segmentation …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2016,*

Estimating the pattern frequency spectrum inside the browser,Matthijs van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract: We present a browser application for estimating the number of frequent patterns; inparticular itemsets; as well as the pattern frequency spectrum. The pattern frequencyspectrum is defined as the function that shows for every value of the frequency threshold$\sigma $ the number of patterns that are frequent in a given dataset. Our demo implementsa recent algorithm proposed by the authors for finding the spectrum. The demo is 100%JavaScript; and runs in all modern browsers. We observe that modern JavaScript enginescan deliver performance that makes it viable to run non-trivial data analysis algorithms inbrowser applications. Subjects: Databases (cs.

Approximate Top-k Retrieval from Hidden Relations,Antti Ukkonen,Abstract: We consider the evaluation of approximate top-k queries from relations with a-prioriunknown values. Such relations can arise for example in the context of expensivepredicates; or cloud-based data sources. The task is to find an approximate top-k set that isclose to the exact one while keeping the total processing cost low. The cost of a query is thesum of the costs of the entries that are read from the hidden relation. A novel aspect of thiswork is that we consider prior information about the values in the hidden matrix. We proposean algorithm that uses regression models at query time to assess whether a row of the matrixcan enter the top-k set given that only a subset of its values are known. The regressionmodels are trained with existing data that follows the same distribution as the relationsubjected to the query. To evaluate the algorithm and to compare it with a method …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1008.5057,2010,*
Frequent Partial Orders,Antti Ukkonen,A natural extension of association rule mining is to make use of temporal information. This wasfirst done in [1]; where the authors present algorithms for mining frequently occurring sequencesof sets of items in a database of transactions. Each of such sequences can be seen as a partialorder on the complete set of items. For more recent work on the same topic please see [13;812]. The slightly different problem of mining frequent episodes from a sequence of events is presentedin [7]. In this case an episode is a partial order over the set of all possible events. The problemdiffers from the one of [1] by considering a stream of events (for example notifications and alertsgenerated by devices in a telecommunications network) instead of a stationary set oftransactions. The same problem is also discussed eg; in [4;5] … Common for the referencesabove is that they do not explicitly call the mined patterns partial orders. One of the first …,*,2009,*

Same bang; fewer bucks: efficient discovery of the cost-influence skyline Supplementary Information,Matthijs van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Proof.(of Proposition 4.1) Let Xi= XInfMax i for short. First; observe that X1∈ P1. This isbecause the greedy algorithm maximizes marginal gain; and no point on P1 can dominatethis; no matter what the costs are. Next; suppose we have Xi− 1∈ Pi− 1. Since Xi is obtainedfrom Xi− 1 by adding that u that maximizes marginal gain in I (·); no point on Pi can dominateXi. This is because for some X∈ Pi to dominate Xi; there would have to have been some setin Pi− 1; such that when some item u is added to this set; the marginal gain is larger than theone found by greedy when forming Xi. Because for a submodular I (·) the marginal gains aredecreasing; such au can not exist. If it existed; the greedy algorithm would have added u atsome earlier point. D,*,*,*
