Time-aware point-of-interest recommendation,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growinglocation based social networks (LBSNs) enables many important location-aware services tousers. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services; which is torecommend places where users have not visited before. Several techniques have beenrecently proposed for the recommendation service. However; no existing work hasconsidered the temporal information for POI recommendations in LBSNs. We believe thattime plays an important role in POI recommendations because most users tend to visitdifferent places at different time in a day;\eg visiting a restaurant at noon and visiting a bar atnight. In this paper; we define a new problem; namely; the time-aware POI recommendation;to recommend POIs for a given user at a specified time in a day. To solve the problem; we …,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,329
Who; where; when and what: discover spatio-temporal topics for twitter users,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract Micro-blogging services; such as Twitter; and location-based social networkapplications have generated short text messages associated with geographic information;posting time; and user ids. The availability of such data received from users offers a goodopportunity to study the user's spatial-temporal behavior and preference. In this paper; wepropose a probabilistic model W 4 (short for Who+Where+When+What) to exploit such datato discover individual users' mobility behaviors from spatial; temporal and activity aspects.To the best of our knowledge; our work offers the first solution to jointly model individualuser's mobility behavior from the three aspects. Our model has a variety of applications; suchas user profiling and location prediction; it can be employed to answer questions suchas``Can we infer the location of a user given a tweet posted by the user and the posting …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,138
Graph-based point-of-interest recommendation with geographical and temporal influences,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Aixin Sun,Abstract The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growinglocation-based social networks (LBSNs) enables a number of important location-awareservices. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services; which is torecommend POIs that users have not visited before. It has been observed that:(i) users tendto visit nearby places; and (ii) users tend to visit different places in different time slots; and inthe same time slot; users tend to periodically visit the same places. For example; usersusually visit a restaurant during lunch hours; and visit a pub at night. In this paper; we focuson the problem of time-aware POI recommendation; which aims at recommending a list ofPOIs for a user to visit at a given time. To exploit both geographical and temporal influencesin time aware POI recommendation; we propose the Geographical-Temporal influences …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,100
Personalized Ranking Metric Embedding for Next New POI Recommendation.,Shanshan Feng; Xutao Li; Yifeng Zeng; Gao Cong; Yeow Meng Chee; Quan Yuan,Abstract The rapidly growing of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) provides a vastamount of check-in data; which enables many services; eg; point-ofinterest (POI)recommendation. In this paper; we study the next new POI recommendation problem inwhich new POIs with respect to users' current location are to be recommended. Thechallenge lies in the difficulty in precisely learning users' sequential information andpersonalizing the recommendation model. To this end; we resort to the Metric Embeddingmethod for the recommendation; which avoids drawbacks of the Matrix Factorizationtechnique. We propose a personalized ranking metric embedding method (PRME) to modelpersonalized check-in sequences. We further develop a PRME-G model; which integratessequential information; individual preference; and geographical influence; to improve the …,IJCAI,2015,58
COM: a generative model for group recommendation,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Chin-Yew Lin,Abstract With the rapid development of online social networks; a growing number of peopleare willing to share their group activities; eg having dinners with colleagues; and watchingmovies with spouses. This motivates the studies on group recommendation; which aims torecommend items for a group of users. Group recommendation is a challenging problembecause different group members have different preferences; and how to make a trade-offamong their preferences for recommendation is still an open problem. In this paper; wepropose a probabilistic model named COM (COnsensus Model) to model the generativeprocess of group activities; and make group recommendations. Intuitively; users in a groupmay have different influences; and those who are expert in topics relevant to the group areusually more influential. In addition; users in a group may behave differently as group …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,48
Topic-driven reader comments summarization,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong,Abstract Readers of a news article often read its comments contributed by other readers. Byreading comments; readers obtain not only complementary information about this newsarticle but also the opinions from other readers. However; the existing ranking mechanismsfor comments (eg; by recency or by user rating) fail to offer an overall picture of topicsdiscussed in comments. In this paper; we first propose to study Topic-driven ReaderComments Summarization (Torcs) problem. We observe that many news articles from anews stream are related to each other; so are their comments. Hence; news articles andtheir associated comments provide context information for user commenting. To implicitlycapture the context information; we propose two topic models to address the Torcs problem;namely; Master-Slave Topic Model (MSTM) and Extended Master-Slave Topic Model …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,44
Enhancing naive bayes with various smoothing methods for short text classification,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract Partly due to the proliferance of microblog; short texts are becoming prominent. Ahuge number of short texts are generated every day; which calls for a method that canefficiently accommodate new data to incrementally adjust classification models. Naive Bayesmeets such a need. We apply several smoothing models to Naive Bayes for question topicclassification; as an example of short text classification; and study their performance. Theexperimental results on a large real question data show that the smoothing methods areable to significantly improve the question classification performance of Naive Bayes. Wealso study the effect of training data size; and question length on performance.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,43
Who; where; when; and what: A nonparametric bayesian approach to context-aware recommendation and search for twitter users,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Kaiqi Zhao; Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun,Abstract Micro-blogging services and location-based social networks; such as Twitter;Weibo; and Foursquare; enable users to post short messages with timestamps andgeographical annotations. The rich spatial-temporal-semantic information of individualsembedded in these geo-annotated short messages provides exciting opportunity to developmany context-aware applications in ubiquitous computing environments. Exampleapplications include contextual recommendation and contextual search. To obtain accuraterecommendations and most relevant search results; it is important to capture users'contextual information (eg; time and location) and to understand users' topical interests andintentions. While time and location can be readily captured by smartphones; understandinguser's interests and intentions calls for effective methods in modeling user mobility …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2015,38
Geoburst: Real-time local event detection in geo-tagged tweet streams,Chao Zhang; Guangyu Zhou; Quan Yuan; Honglei Zhuang; Yu Zheng; Lance Kaplan; Shaowen Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract The real-time discovery of local events (eg; protests; crimes; disasters) is of greatimportance to various applications; such as crime monitoring; disaster alarming; and activityrecommendation. While this task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of timelyand reliable data sources; the recent explosive growth in geo-tagged tweet data brings newopportunities to it. That said; how to extract quality local events from geo-tagged tweetstreams in real time remains largely unsolved so far. We propose GeoBurst; a method thatenables effective and real-time local event detection from geo-tagged tweet streams. With anovel authority measure that captures the geo-topic correlations among tweets; GeoBurstfirst identifies several pivots in the query window. Such pivots serve as representative tweetsfor potential local events and naturally attract similar tweets to form candidate events.

Tagging your tweets: A probabilistic modeling of hashtag annotation in twitter,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong,Abstract The adoption of hashtags in major social networks including Twitter; Facebook; andGoogle+ is a strong evidence of its importance in facilitating information diffusion and socialchatting. To understand the factors (eg; user interest; posting time and tweet content) thatmay affect hashtag annotation in Twitter and to capture the implicit relations between latenttopics in tweets and their corresponding hashtags; we propose two PLSA-style topic modelsto model the hashtag annotation behavior in Twitter. Content-Pivoted Model (CPM) assumesthat tweet content guides the generation of hashtags while Hashtag-Pivoted Model (HPM)assumes that hashtags guide the generation of tweet content. Both models jointlyincorporate user; time; hashtag and tweet content in a probabilistic framework. The PLSA-style models also enable us to verify the impact of social factor on hashtag annotation by …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,33
Approaches to exploring category information for question retrieval in community question-answer archives,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen; Quan Yuan,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) is a popular type of service where users askquestions and where answers are obtained from other users or from historical question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchyof categories. As an essential function of CQA services; question retrieval in a CQA archiveaims to retrieve historical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. Thisarticle presents several new approaches to exploiting the category information of questionsfor improving the performance of question retrieval; and it applies these approaches toexisting question retrieval models; including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model.Experiments conducted on real CQA data demonstrate that the proposed techniques areeffective and efficient and are capable of outperforming a variety of baseline methods …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2012,31
SAR: A sentiment-aspect-region model for user preference analysis in geo-tagged reviews,Kaiqi Zhao; Gao Cong; Quan Yuan; Kenny Q Zhu,Many location based services; such as FourSquare; Yelp; TripAdvisor; Google Places; etc.;allow users to compose reviews or tips on points of interest (POIs); each having ageographical coordinates. These services have accumulated a large amount of such geo-tagged review data; which allows deep analysis of user preferences in POIs. This paperstudies two types of user preferences to POIs: topical-region preference and category awaretopical-aspect preference. We propose a unified probabilistic model to capture these twopreferences simultaneously. In addition; our model is capable of capturing the interaction ofdifferent factors; including topical aspect; sentiment; and spatial information. The model canbe used in a number of applications; such as POI recommendation and userrecommendation; among others. In addition; the model enables us to investigate whether …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,25
Gmove: Group-level mobility modeling using geo-tagged social media,Chao Zhang; Keyang Zhang; Quan Yuan; Luming Zhang; Tim Hanratty; Jiawei Han,Abstract Understanding human mobility is of great importance to various applications; suchas urban planning; traffic scheduling; and location prediction. While there has been fruitfulresearch on modeling human mobility using tracking data (eg; GPS traces); the recentgrowth of geo-tagged social media (GeoSM) brings new opportunities to this task because ofits sheer size and multi-dimensional nature. Nevertheless; how to obtain quality mobilitymodels from the highly sparse and complex GeoSM data remains a challenge that cannotbe readily addressed by existing techniques. We propose GMove; a group-level mobilitymodeling method using GeoSM data. Our insight is that the GeoSM data usually containsmultiple user groups; where the users within the same group share significant movementregularity. Meanwhile; user grouping and mobility modeling are two intertwined tasks:(1) …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,23
Regions; periods; activities: Uncovering urban dynamics via cross-modal representation learning,Chao Zhang; Keyang Zhang; Quan Yuan; Haoruo Peng; Yu Zheng; Tim Hanratty; Shaowen Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the ever-increasing urbanization process; systematically modeling people'sactivities in the urban space is being recognized as a crucial socioeconomic task. This taskwas nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of reliable data sources; yet the emergenceof geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data sheds new light on it. Recently; there have beenfruitful studies on discovering geographical topics from GTSM data. However; their highcomputational costs and strong distributional assumptions about the latent topics hinderthem from fully unleashing the power of GTSM. To bridge the gap; we present CrossMap; anovel cross-modal representation learning method that uncovers urban dynamics withmassive GTSM data. CrossMap first employs an accelerated mode seeking procedure todetect spatiotemporal hotspots underlying people's activities.

PRED: Periodic region detection for mobility modeling of social media users,Quan Yuan; Wei Zhang; Chao Zhang; Xinhe Geng; Gao Cong; Jiawei Han,Abstract The availability of massive geo-annotated social media data sheds light on studyinghuman mobility patterns. Among them; periodic pattern;\ie an individual visiting ageographical region with some specific time interval; has been recognized as one of themost important. Mining periodic patterns has a variety of applications; such as locationprediction; anomaly detection; and location-and time-aware recommendation. However; it isa challenging task: the regions of a person and the periods of each region are bothunknown. The interdependency between them makes the task even harder. Hence; existingmethods are far from satisfactory for detecting periodic patterns from the low-sampling andnoisy social media data. We propose a Bayesian non-parametric model; named\textbf {P}eriodic\textbf {RE} gion\textbf {D} etection (PRED); to discover periodic mobility patterns …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,12
A Tri-Role Topic Model for Domain-Specific Question Answering.,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong,Abstract Stack Overflow and MedHelp are examples of domainspecific community-basedquestion answering (CQA) systems. Different from CQA systems for general topics (eg;Yahoo! Answers; Baidu Knows); questions and answers in domain-specific CQA systemsare mostly in the same topical domain; enabling more comprehensive interaction betweenusers on fine-grained topics. In such systems; users are more likely to ask questions onunfamiliar topics and to answer questions matching their expertise. Users can also voteanswers based on their judgements. In this paper; we propose a Tri-Role Topic Model(TRTM) to model the tri-roles of users (ie; as askers; answerers; and voters; respectively)and the activities of each role including composing question; selecting question to answer;contributing and voting answers. The proposed model can be used to enhance CQA …,AAAI,2015,12
Where your photo is taken: Geolocation prediction for social images,Bo Liu; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Dong Xu,Abstract Social image-sharing websites have attracted a large number of users. Thesesystems allow users to associate geolocation information with their images; which isessential for many interesting applications. However; only a small fraction of social imageshave geolocation information. Thus; an automated tool for suggesting geolocation isessential to help users geotag their images. In this article; we use a large data set consistingof 221 million Flickr images uploaded by 2.2 million users. For the first time; we analyze useruploading patterns; user geotagging behaviors; and the relationship between the taken-timegap and the geographical distance between two images from the same user. Based on thefindings; we represent a user profile by historical tags for the user and build a multinomialmodel on the user profile for geotagging.

Collaborative Multi-Level Embedding Learning from Reviews for Rating Prediction.,Wei Zhang; Quan Yuan; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang,Abstract We investigate the problem of personalized reviewbased rating prediction whichaims at predicting users' ratings for items that they have not evaluated by using theirhistorical reviews and ratings. Most of existing methods solve this problem by integratingtopic model and latent factor model to learn interpretable user and items factors. However;these methods cannot utilize word local context information of reviews. Moreover; it simplyrestricts user and item representations equivalent to their review representations; which maybring some irrelevant information in review text and harm the accuracy of rating prediction. Inthis paper; we propose a novel Collaborative Multi-Level Embedding (CMLE) model toaddress these limitations. The main technical contribution of CMLE is to integrate wordembedding model with standard matrix factorization model through a projection level …,IJCAI,2016,11
Where you instagram?: Associating your instagram photos with points of interest,Xutao Li; Tuan-Anh Nguyen Pham; Gao Cong; Quan Yuan; Xiao-Li Li; Shonali Krishnaswamy,Abstract Instagram; an online photo-sharing platform; has gained increasing popularity. Itallows users to take photos; apply digital filters and share them with friends instantaneouslyby using mobile devices. Instagram provides users with the functionality to associate theirphotos with points of interest; and it thus becomes feasible to study the association betweenpoints of interest and Instagram photos. However; no previous work studies the association.In this paper; we propose to study the problem of mapping Instagram photos to points ofinterest. To understand the problem; we analyze Instagram datasets; and report our findings;which also characterize the challenges of the problem. To address the challenges; wepropose to model the mapping problem as a ranking problem; and develop a method tolearn a ranking function by exploiting the textual; visual and user information of photos.

Category hierarchy maintenance: a data-driven approach,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Aixin Sun; Chin-Yew Lin; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract Category hierarchies often evolve at a much slower pace than the documentsreside in. With newly available documents kept adding into a hierarchy; new topics emergeand documents within the same category become less topically cohesive. In this paper; wepropose a novel automatic approach to modifying a given category hierarchy byredistributing its documents into more topically cohesive categories. The modification isachieved with three operations (namely; sprout; merge; and assign) with reference to anauxiliary hierarchy for additional semantic information; the auxiliary hierarchy covers asimilar set of topics as the hierarchy to be modified. Our user study shows that the modifiedcategory hierarchy is semantically meaningful. As an extrinsic evaluation; we conductexperiments on document classification using real data from Yahoo!

Bridging Collaborative Filtering and Semi-Supervised Learning: A Neural Approach for POI Recommendation,Carl Yang; Lanxiao Bai; Chao Zhang; Quan Yuan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recommender system is one of the most popular data mining topics that keepdrawing extensive attention from both academia and industry. Among them; POI (point ofinterest) recommendation is extremely practical but challenging: it greatly benefits bothusers and businesses in real-world life; but it is hard due to data scarcity and variouscontext. While a number of algorithms attempt to tackle the problem wrt specific data andproblem settings; they often fail when the scenarios change. In this work; we propose todevise a general and principled SSL (semi-supervised learning) framework; to alleviate datascarcity via smoothing among neighboring users and POIs; and treat various context byregularizing user preference based on context graphs.

ReAct: Online Multimodal Embedding for Recency-Aware Spatiotemporal Activity Modeling,Chao Zhang; Keyang Zhang; Quan Yuan; Fangbo Tao; Luming Zhang; Tim Hanratty; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatiotemporalactivity modeling is an important task for applications like tourrecommendation and place search. The recently developed geographical topic models havedemonstrated compelling results in using geo-tagged social media (GTSM) forspatiotemporal activity modeling. Nevertheless; they all operate in batch and cannotdynamically accommodate the latest information in the GTSM stream to reveal up-to-datespatiotemporal activities. We propose ReAct; a method that processes continuous GTSMstreams and obtains recency-aware spatiotemporal activity models on the fly. Distinguishedfrom existing topic-based methods; ReAct embeds all the regions; hours; and keywords intothe same latent space to capture their correlations.

Detecting Multiple Periods and Periodic Patterns in Event Time Sequences,Quan Yuan; Jingbo Shang; Xin Cao; Chao Zhang; Xinhe Geng; Jiawei Han,Abstract Periodicity is prevalent in physical world; and many events involve more than oneperiods; eg individual's mobility; tide pattern; and massive transportation utilization. Knowingthe true periods of events can benefit a number of applications; such as traffic prediction;time-aware recommendation and advertisement; and anomaly detection. However;detecting multiple periods is a very challenging task due to not only the interwoven periodicpatterns but also the low quality of event tracking records. In this paper; we study theproblem of discovering all true periods and the corresponded occurring patterns of an eventfrom a noisy and incomplete observation sequence. We devise a novel scoring function; bymaximizing which we can identify the true periodic patterns involved in the sequence.
