Testing for the cartel in OPEC: non-cooperative collusion or just non-cooperative?,Pedro A Almoguera; Christopher C Douglas; Ana María Herrera,Abstract This paper extends the framework of and Porter (1983 a) to encompass the case ofa cartel (OPEC) faced by a competitive fringe (non-OPEC oil producers). Estimation of asimultaneous equation switching regression model allows us to examine which marketstructure better characterizes the world oil market during the 1974–2004 period and to testwhether switches between collusive and non-cooperative behaviour occurred. The nullhypothesis that no switch occurred is rejected in favour of the alternative that bothcooperative and non-cooperative behaviour was observed. We find that; although therewere periods in which oil prices were measurably higher owing to collusion among OPECmembers; overall OPEC has not been effective in systematically raising prices aboveCournot competition levels. Our results suggest that; on average over the period of study …,Oxford Review of Economic Policy,2011,79
Do gasoline prices exhibit asymmetry? Not usually!,Christopher C Douglas,Abstract Previous studies have found evidence of asymmetric price adjustment in US retailgasoline prices in that gasoline prices rise more rapidly in response to a cost increase thanfall in response to a cost decrease. By estimating a threshold cointegration model that allowsfor multiple regimes; I am able to test how sensitive this result is to outlying observations. Incontrast to previous studies; I find little evidence of asymmetry for the vast majority ofobservations and that the asymmetry is being driven by a small number of outlyingobservations.,Energy Economics,2010,40
Why are gasoline prices sticky? A test of alternative models of price adjustment,Christopher Douglas; Ana María Herrera,Abstract Macroeconomic models of business cycles rely on the assumption that firms adjustprices infrequently to generate the short-run non-neutrality of money documented by themonetary transmission literature. They posit different mechanisms to generate pricestickiness; with correspondingly different implications for inflation dynamics. Using anautoregressive conditional binomial model; we test which mechanism is most consistent withthe pattern of price adjustment found in daily wholesale gasoline price data. Our results leadus to reject menu costs and information-processing delays but suggest that strategicconsiderations related to the idea of 'fair pricing'play an important role in accounting for pricestickiness.

Dynamic pricing and asymmetries in retail gasoline markets: What can they tell us about price stickiness?,Christopher C Douglas; Ana María Herrera,Abstract Theoretical explanations for price stickiness used in businesses cycle models arediverse (eg; information processing delays; rational inattention and fair pricing); with eachtheory resulting in a different implication for inflation dynamics. Using an autoregressiveconditional binomial model and a data set consisting of daily observations of price and costfor 15 Philadelphia retail gasoline stations; we test which of these theories is most consistentwith the observed pattern of price adjustment. Our findings of time dependence; asymmetryand the role of cost volatility are consistent with a combination of fairness considerations andrational inattention by producers.,Economics Letters,2014,6
Capturing the time dynamics of central bank intervention,Christopher C Douglas; Marek Kolar,Abstract We estimate central bank reaction functions using the autoregressive conditionalhazard model and the autoregressive conditional binomial model. We find that the FederalReserve and Bundesbank intervened when the market was calmer; and the Bundesbankintervened in response to exchange rates being out-of-line with fundamentals. Japanintervened in response to changes in the nominal exchange rate; and intervention differedbefore and after Eisuke Sakakibara became Director General of the International FinanceBureau of the Ministry of Finance in Japan. We argue that these results are consistent withcentral bank policy goals and the effect of intervention on the exchange rate.,Journal of International Financial Markets; Institutions and Money,2009,5

The Impact of Smoking Bans on Bar and Restaurant Values.,Michael Allgrunn; Christopher C Douglas,Abstract The state of Florida implemented an indoor smoking ban in 2003 that exemptedbars. Using a data set containing the sales price of bars and restaurants in Florida thatspans 1999-2011; we utilize a difference-in-difference framework to examine whether or nota smoking ban impacts the value of bars and restaurants and in what direction. We find thatthe value of restaurants decreased following the smoking ban; while the value of barsincreased. These results suggest that a smoking ban has a negative impact on a business'value.(D23; H75; 118)[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Economics(03616576) is the property of Missouri Valley Economic Association and its content may notbe copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder'sexpress written permission.

Committee Bias and Market Inefficiency; Evidence from the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.,Christopher C Douglas,Abstract Various studies find evidence that the NCAA men's basketball section committeeexhibits bias in the seeding of teams for the" March Madness" basketball tournament. Fewerstudies examine whether March Madness betting markets are efficient. Using a decade'sworth of NCAA and point spread data that allow for additional sources of bias than what hasbeen already considered; I find evidence that the selection committee does exhibit biaswhen seeding teams. Not all of these biases are eliminated by the betting market; whichseems to allow for profit opportunities.(G14; L83)[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright ofJournal of Economics (03616576) is the property of Missouri Valley Economic Associationand its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv withoutthe copyright holder's express written permission.

The Clash of Generations: Saving Ourselves; Our Kids; and Our Economy by Laurence J. Kotlikoff and Scott Burns,Christopher C Douglas,This is a three part book dealing with an important; yet often overlooked; aspect of theeconomy; the coming fiscal crunch due to entitlement spending. Part 1 lays out the numbersin all their depressing detail. Part 2 presents bipartisan solutions to solve the entitlementproblem. Part 3 gives financial advice for families on investing with the knowledge that futureentitlement benefits will be less than promised. This involves a strategy with which most economistswould be familiar: invest in low-cost index funds; do not actively manage your portfolio; and avoidhigh cost; professional advisers in the financial services sector as much as possible. The authorspaint a bleak picture of the United States fiscal situation. The official government debt of $11trillion obscures the real fiscal shortfall (or “gap”) of $211 trillion; which is the difference betweenpromised future entitlement benefits and what the government can afford to pay. In fact …,Journal of Economic Insight,2014,*

Inside the Fed: Monetary Policy and Its Management; Martin through Greenspan to Bernanke by Stephen H. Axilrod,Christopher C Douglas,An insider's account of Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions would be of interest to anyeconomist. This is what the author delivers. Stephen Alixrod worked for the Fed in WashingtonDC from 1952-1986 in various capacities close to the federal open market committee(FOMC). He served as the top staff person for monetary policy and was in close contact with thechairmen during that time period. In fact; he played tennis against William McChesney Martinduring regular noon doubles matches. Thus; Axilrod is uniquely qualified to offer insight intothe workings of the FOMC and its chairmen. Axilrod divides his book into eight chapters; the firstbeing an overview of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve; the last two summarize theFed; and the middle five chapters encompass the six chairmen since (and including) WilliamMcChesney Martin. Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke are dealt with together in one …,Journal of Economic Insight,2011,*
How Do Private Markets Address Smoking Externalities?,Amelia Biehl; Christopher C Douglas,ABSTRACT. We survey bars and restaurants in Genesee County; Michigan to examine how;absent a smoking ban; different establishments accommodate smokers and nonsmokers.We find evidence that smokers and nonsmokers are systematically accommodated. Themajority of establishments without bars voluntarily ban smoking; and the majority ofestablishments with bars restrict smoking to a separate room or to the bar area. This patternof accommodation is consistent with what the Coase Theorem would predict when dealingwith the externalities created by secondhand smoke.(D21; H75; I18),Journal of Economic Insight,2011,*
