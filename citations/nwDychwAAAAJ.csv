Biodegradation aspects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): a review,AK Haritash; CP Kaushik,Abstract PAHs are aromatic hydrocarbons with two or more fused benzene rings with naturalas well as anthropogenic sources. They are widely distributed environmental contaminantsthat have detrimental biological effects; toxicity; mutagenecity and carcinogenicity. Due totheir ubiquitous occurrence; recalcitrance; bioaccumulation potential and carcinogenicactivity; the PAHs have gathered significant environmental concern. Although PAH mayundergo adsorption; volatilization; photolysis; and chemical degradation; microbialdegradation is the major degradation process. PAH degradation depends on theenvironmental conditions; number and type of the microorganisms; nature and chemicalstructure of the chemical compound being degraded. They are biodegraded/biotransformedinto less complex metabolites; and through mineralization into inorganic minerals; H 2 O …,*,2009,1550

Co-composting of pressmud and flyash with distillery effluent.,Nishtha Yadav; Vikash Talyan; CP Kaushik,Abstract India is producing 20 million tones of sugar annually. Most of the sugar industriesare incorporated with the cane molasses-based distillery units. The distillery effluent fromthese industries is discharged directly into river or on land without treatment. An attempt hasbeen made to compost the effluent with pressmud (by product of sugar industry) and flyash(waste from boilers) for the production of biomanure; so that discharging of effluent into openwaterbodies can be reduced; and the byproducts can be used to improve the soil fertility.The concentrated effluent was sprayed to maintain moisture content (approximately 50-60%). The chemical and physicochemical parameters as well as biological tests todetermine the quality of compost have been performed. The mixture of pressmud and flyash(3: 1 weight basis) was assessed suitable filler material for utilization of distillery effluent …,International Transactions in Applied Sciences,2012,*
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in indoor and outdoor sites of hissar city,Suman Lata; CP Kaushik,ABSTRACT Air pollution is one of the serious environmental problem now-a-days;particularly in urban areas of all over the world.

SITE SUITABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF RAMPUR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT; HIMACHAL PRADESH (INDIA),Sharma SK; A Kaushik; CP Kaushik; A Sharma,ABSTRACT The demand of water and its related services increased with growing populationand rising economic status. Dams have been seen as an effective way of meeting water andenergy needs. The reason behind construction of these large dams is to producehydropower besides providing continuous flow of water for irrigation and domestic purposes.In recent years; many questions are raised about existing dams. It is therefore becomedifficult to plan new dams. The second half of century has been proliferation of large scaleriver valley projects (nearly 65%) in developing countries. These projects are oftenmultipurpose so as to meet various needs such as flood control; irrigation and production ofhydropower. There are about 37;500 dams over the world of over 15m height.

Exploitation of native strains of pseudomonas for decontamination of HCH contaminated soils,Archna Gupta; Chander Prakash Kaushik,Abstract Organochlorine insecticides have been extensively used in tropical countries for thecontrol of agricultural and medical pests. Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) is a majororganochlorine pesticide; produced and used in India. In fact; it has accounted for about45% of the total pesticides used in India during 1988-89. Technical mixture of HCH containsfour main isomers viz. alpha; beta; gamma and delta (Alpha; Beta; Gamma; Delta) out ofwhich only gamma-HCH has the insecticidal properties. Gamma-HCH is volatile and doesnot persist in the environment for long; but the remaining isomers have a high persistence.Due to their persistence and tendency to bio-accumulate in non-target organisms; technicalmixture of HCH has been banned worldwide. However; HCH contaminated sites are evennow common and widespread due to the excessive and indiscriminate use prior to the …,*,*,*
