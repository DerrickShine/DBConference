Efficient network aware search in collaborative tagging sites,Sihem Amer Yahia; Michael Benedikt; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity toexplore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of anetwork of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper; we present the first in-depth study ofnetwork-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of ananswer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue thatobvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive; due to the dependence ofscores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintainingscore upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag; over the entire collection of users. The resulting boundsare very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,125
Putting lipstick on pig: Enabling database-style workflow provenance,Yael Amsterdamer; Susan B Davidson; Daniel Deutch; Tova Milo; Julia Stoyanovich; Val Tannen,Abstract Workflow provenance typically assumes that each module is a" black-box"; so thateach output depends on all inputs (coarse-grained dependencies). Furthermore; it does notmodel the internal state of a module; which can change between repeated executions. Inpractice; however; an output may depend on only a small subset of the inputs (fine-graineddependencies) as well as on the internal state of the module. We present a novelprovenance framework that marries database-style and workflow-style provenance; by usingPig Latin to expose the functionality of modules; thus capturing internal state and fine-grained dependencies. A critical ingredient in our solution is the use of a novel form ofprovenance graph that models module invocations and yields a compact representation offine-grained workflow provenance. It also enables a number of novel graph …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,115
Automatically and adaptively determining execution plans for queries with parameter markers,*,A method for automatically and adaptively determining query execution plans for parametricqueries. A first classifier trained by an initial set of training points is generated using a set ofrandom decision trees (RDTs). A query workload and/or database statistics are dynamicallyupdated. A new set of training points collected off-line is used to modify the first classifier intoa second classifier. A database query is received at a runtime subsequent to the off linephase. The query includes predicates having parameter markers bound to actual values.The predicates are associated with selectivities. The query execution plan is determined byidentifying an optimal average of posterior probabilities obtained across a set of RDTs andmapping the selectivities to a plan. The determined query execution plan is included in anaugmented set of training points that includes the initial set and the new set.,*,2008,78
On provenance and privacy,Susan B Davidson; Sanjeev Khanna; Sudeepa Roy; Julia Stoyanovich; Val Tannen; Yi Chen,Abstract Provenance in scientific workflows is a double-edged sword. On the one hand;recording information about the module executions used to produce a data item; as well asthe parameter settings and intermediate data items passed between module executions;enables transparency and reproducibility of results. On the other hand; a scientific workflowoften contains private or confidential data and uses proprietary modules. Hence; providingexact answers to provenance queries over all executions of the workflow may reveal privateinformation. In this paper we discuss privacy concerns in scientific workflows--data; module;and structural privacy-and frame several natural questions:(i) Can we formally analyze data;module; and structural privacy; giving provable privacy guarantees for an unlimited/boundednumber of provenance queries?(ii) How can we answer search and structural queries …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Database Theory,2011,63

Enabling privacy in provenance-aware workflow systems,Susan B Davidson; Sanjeev Khanna; Sudeepa Roy; Julia Stoyanovich; Val Tannen; Yi Chen; Tova Milo,A new paradigm for creating and correcting scientific analyses is emerging; that ofprovenance-aware workflow systems. In such systems; repositories of workflowspecifications and of provenance graphs that represent their executions will be madeavailable as part of scientific information sharing. This will allow users to search and queryboth workflow specifications and their provenance graphs: Scientists who wish to performnew analyses may search workflow repositories to find specifications of interest to reuse ormodify. They may also search provenance information to understand the meaning of aworkflow; or to debug a specification. Finding erroneous or suspect data; a user may thenask provenance queries to determine what downstream data might have been affected; or tounderstand how the process failed that led to creating the data.

Exploring repositories of scientific workflows,Julia Stoyanovich; Ben Taskar; Susan Davidson,Abstract Scientific workflows are gaining popularity; and repositories of workflows arestarting to emerge. In this paper we present some initial experiences of informationdiscovery in repositories of scientific workflows. In the first part of the paper we consider acollection of VisTrails workflows; and explore how this collection may be summarized whenworkflow modules are used as features. We present a hierarchical browsable view of therepository in which categories are derived using frequent itemset mining or latent Dirichletallocation. We demonstrate that both approaches may be used for effective data exploration.In the second part of the paper we focus on a collection of Taverna workflows frommyExperiment. org; and consider how these workflows may be browsed using modules andtags as features.

EntityAuthority: Semantically Enriched Graph-Based Authority Propagation.,Julia Stoyanovich; Srikanta J Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Gerhard Weikum,ABSTRACT This paper pursues the recently emerging paradigm of searching for entities thatare embedded in Web pages. We utilize informationextraction techniques to identify entitycandidates in documents; map them onto entries in a richly structured ontology; and derive ageneralized data graph that encompasses Web pages; entities; and ontological conceptsand relationships. We exploit this combination of pages and entities for a novel kind ofsearch-result ranking; coined EntityAuthority; in order to improve the quality of keywordqueries that return either pages or entities. To this end; we utilize the mutual reinforcementbetween authoritative pages and important entities. This resembles the HITS method forWeb-graph link analysis and recently proposed ObjectRank methods; but our approachoperates on a much richer; typed graph structure with different kinds of nodes and also …,WebDB,2007,20
Deriving probabilistic databases with inference ensembles,Julia Stoyanovich; Susan Davidson; Tova Milo; Val Tannen,Many real-world applications deal with uncertain or missing data; prompting a surge ofactivity in the area of probabilistic databases. A shortcoming of prior work is the assumptionthat an appropriate probabilistic model; along with the necessary probability distributions; isgiven. We address this shortcoming by presenting a framework for learning a set ofinference ensembles; termed meta-rule semi-lattices; or MRSL; from the complete portion ofthe data. We use the MRSL to infer probability distributions for missing data; anddemonstrate experimentally that high accuracy is achieved when a single attribute value ismissing per tuple. We next propose an inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling thataccurately predicts the probability distribution for multiple missing values. We also developan optimization that greatly improves performance of multi-attribute inference for …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,18
Viewing the web as a distributed knowledge base,Serge Abiteboul; Emilien Antoine; Julia Stoyanovich,This paper addresses the challenges faced by everyday Web users; who interact withinherently heterogeneous and distributed information. Managing such data is currentlybeyond the skills of casual users. We describe ongoing work that has as its goal thedevelopment of foundations for declarative distributed data management. In this approach;we see the Web as a knowledge base consisting of distributed logical facts and rules. Ourobjective is to enable automated reasoning over this knowledge base; ultimately improvingthe quality of service and of data. For this; we use Webdamlog; a Datalogstyle language withrule delegation. We outline ongoing efforts on the Web dam Exchange platform thatcombines Webdamlog evaluation with communication and security protocols.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,17

A system for management and analysis of preference data,Marie Jacob; Benny Kimelfeld; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract Preference data arises in a wide variety of domains. Over the past decade; we haveseen a sharp increase in the volume of preference data; in the diversity of applications thatuse it; and in the richness of preference data analysis methods. Examples of applicationsinclude rank aggregation in genomic data analysis; management of votes in elections; andrecommendation systems in e-commerce. However; little attention has been paid to thechallenges of building a system for preference-data management; which would helpincorporate sophisticated analytics into larger applications; support computationalabstractions for usability by data scientists; and enable scaling up to modern volumes. Thisvision paper proposes a management system for preference data that aims to address thesechallenges.

Symmetric relations and cardinality-bounded multisets in database systems,Kenneth A Ross; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract In a binary symmetric relationship; A is related to B if and only if B is related to A.Symmetric relationships between k participating entities can be represented as multisets ofcardinality k. Cardinality-bounded multisets are natural in several real-world applications.Conventional representations in relational databases suffer from several consistency andperformance problems. We argue that the database system itself should provide nativesupport for cardinality-bounded multisets. We provide techniques to be implemented by thedatabase engine that avoid the drawbacks; and allow a schema designer to simply declarea table to be symmetric in certain attributes. We describe a compact data structure; andupdate methods for the structure. We describe an algebraic symmetric closure operator; andshow how it can be moved around in a query plan during query optimization in order to …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,15
Measuring fairness in ranked outputs,Ke Yang; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract: Ranking and scoring are ubiquitous. We consider the setting in which an institution;called a ranker; evaluates a set of individuals based on demographic; behavioral or othercharacteristics. The final output is a ranking that represents the relative quality of theindividuals. While automatic and therefore seemingly objective; rankers can; and often do;discriminate against individuals and systematically disadvantage members of protectedgroups. This warrants a careful study of the fairness of a ranking scheme. In this paper wepropose fairness measures for ranked outputs. We develop a data generation procedurethat allows us to systematically control the degree of unfairness in the output; and study thebehavior of our measures on these datasets. We then apply our proposed measures toseveral real datasets; and demonstrate cases of unfairness. Finally; we show preliminary …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.08559,2016,14

Collaborative access control in webdamlog,Vera Zaychik Moffitt; Julia Stoyanovich; Serge Abiteboul; Gerome Miklau,Abstract The management of Web users' personal information is increasingly distributedacross a broad array of applications and systems; including online social networks andcloud-based services. Users wish to share data using these systems; but avoiding the risksof unintended disclosures or unauthorized access by applications has become a majorchallenge. We propose a novel access control model that operates within a distributed datamanagement framework based on datalog. Using this model; users can control access todata they own and control applications they run. They can conveniently specify accesscontrol policies providing flexible tuple-level control derived using provenance information.We present a formal specification of the model; an implementation built using an open-source distributed datalog engine; and an extensive experimental evaluation showing …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,11

Yet; if notused responsibly; this technology can propel economic inequality; destabilize globalmarkets and affirm systemic bias. While the potential benefits of big data are well-accepted;the importance of using these techniques in a fair and transparent manner is rarelyconsidered. The primary goal of this tutorial is to draw the attention of the data managementcommunity to the important emerging subject of responsible data management and analysis.We will offer our perspective on the issue; will give an overview of existing technical work;primarily from the data mining and algorithms communities; and will motivate future researchdirections.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2016,10
Making interval-based clustering rank-aware,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Tova Milo,Abstract In online applications; such as online dating; users often query and rank largecollections of structured items. Top results tend to be homogeneous; which hinders dataexploration. For example; a dating website user who is looking for a partner between 20 and40 years old; and who sorts the matches by income from higher to lower; will see a largenumber of matches in their late 30s who hold an MBA degree and work in the financialindustry; before seeing any matches in different age groups and walks of life. An alternativeto presenting results in a ranked list is to find clusters in the result space; identified by acombination of attributes that correlate with rank. Such clusters may describe matchesbetween 35 and 40 with an MBA; matches between 25 and 30 who work in the softwareindustry; etc.; allowing for data exploration of ranked results.

Understanding Local Structure in Ranked Datasets.,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Susan B Davidson; Marie Jacob; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT Ranked data is ubiquitous in real-world applications. Rankings arise naturallywhen users express preferences about products and services; when voters cast ballots inelections; when funding proposals are evaluated based on their merits and universitydepartments based on their reputation; or when genes are ordered based on theirexpression levels under various experimental conditions. We observe that ranked dataexhibits interesting local structure; representing agreement of subsets of rankers oversubsets of items. Being able to model; identify and describe such structure is important;because it enables novel kinds of analysis with the potential of making ground-breakingimpact; but is challenging to do effectively and efficiently.

Workload-driven learning of mallows mixtures with pairwise preference data,Julia Stoyanovich; Lovro Ilijasic; Haoyue Ping,Abstract In this paper we present a framework for learning mixtures of Mallows models fromlarge samples of incomplete preferences. The problem we address is of significant practicalimportance in social choice; recommender systems; and other domains where it is requiredto aggregate; or otherwise analyze; preferences of a heterogeneous user base. We improveon state-of-the-art methods for learning mixtures of Mallows models with pairwise preferencedata. Exact sampling from the Mallows posterior in presence of arbitrary pairwise evidenceis known to be intractable even for a single Mallows. This motivated to the development ofan approximate sampler called AMP. In this paper we propose AMPx; an ensemble methodfor approximate sampling from the Mallows posterior that combines AMP with frequency-based estimation of posterior probabilities.

Search and result presentation in scientific workflow repositories,Susan B Davidson; Xiaocheng Huang; Julia Stoyanovich; Xiaojie Yuan,Abstract We study the problem of searching a repository of complex hierarchical workflowswhose component modules; both composite and atomic; have been annotated withkeywords. Since keyword search does not use the graph structure of a workflow; we developa model of workflows using context-free bag grammars. We then give efficient polynomial-time algorithms that; given a workflow and a keyword query; determine whether someexecution of the workflow matches the query. Based on these algorithms we develop asearch and ranking solution that efficiently retrieves the top-k grammars from a repository.Finally; we propose a novel result presentation method for grammars matching a keywordquery; based on representative parse-trees. The effectiveness of our approach is validatedthrough an extensive experimental evaluation.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,3

Rank-aware clustering of structured datasets,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract In online applications such as Yahoo! Personals and Yahoo! Real Estate usersdefine structured profiles in order to find potentially interesting matches. Typically; profilesare evaluated against large datasets and produce thousands of matches. In addition tofiltering; users also specify ranking in their profile; and matches are returned in a ranked list.Top results in a list are typically homogeneous; which hinders data exploration. Forexample; a user looking for 1-or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a largenumber of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before seeing a differentapartment. An alternative to ranking is to group matches on common attribute values; eg;cheap 1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods; 2-bedrooms with 2 baths; and choose groups inrelationship with ranking.

Towards sequenced semantics for evolving graphs.,Vera Zaychik Moffitt; Julia Stoyanovich,ABSTRACT The research community has adopted a sequence of snapshots as the logicalrepresentation of evolving graphs—graphs that change over time and whose history ofevolution we want to preserve for analysis. This paper argues that the snapshot sequencemodel of evolving graphs is insufficient for representation and analysis of a wide range ofnetworks. Instead; we propose to use the interval model with sequenced semantics. In thismodel nodes and edges are associated with their validity intervals; and operations adhere tothe properties of snapshot reducibility; extended snapshot reducibility; and changepreservation. We show the advantages of adopting this model for evolving graphs and laythe groundwork for an evolving graph query language with sequenced semantics.

Yet; if not usedresponsibly; large-scale data analysis and data-driven algorithmic decision-making canincrease economic inequality; affirm systemic bias; and even destabilize global markets.While the potential benefits of data analysis techniques are well accepted; the importance ofusing them responsibly-that is; in accordance with ethical and moral norms; and with legaland policy considerations-is not yet part of the mainstream research agenda in computerscience.

Keyword search in workflow repositories with access control,Susan B Davidson; Soohyun Lee; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract A number of on-line repositories of scientific workflows are emerging. Theserepositories enable sharing and reuse of workflows; and aid in the design of new workflows.The growing size of these repositories; the complex hierarchical structure of the workflows;and the need to incorporate access control mechanisms make information discovery inthese repositories an interesting challenge. This paper formalizes keyword search inrepositories of hierarchical workflows. We start by defining what it means for a singlehierarchical workflow to match a keyword query while accounting for access control; anddiscuss options for displaying the resulting matches within the workflow. We extend this tosearch over workflow repositories; by proposing various ranking semantics that build ontechniques from XML search and from information retrieval; and adapting them to our …,*,2011,2
Search and ranking in semantically rich applications,Julia Stoyanovich,The central role of Data Management in today's society may be compared to the role ofPhysics in early 20th Century when it entered its Golden Age. Data is the raw matter of theUniverse of Information; and; in a process analogous to nuclear fusion; data is transformedprogressively into information; and then into knowledge. Information is; in fact; so important;that even philosophers are starting to get interested. An emerging discipline of Philosophy ofInformation [Floridi; 2009b] postulates that" to be is to be an informational entity"[Ess; 2009].According to this new doctrine; history is synonymous with the information age; sinceprehistory is the age in human development that precedes the availability of recordingsystems. The information-based nature of our society has only recently become apparent;and is clearly linked to the wide-spread adoption of the World Wide Web as a platform for …,*,2010,2
ReoptSMART: A Learning Query Plan Cache,Julia Stoyanovich; Kenneth A Ross; Jun Rao; Wei Fan; Volker Markl; Guy Lohman,Abstract: The task of query optimization in modern relational database systems is importantbut can be computationally expensive. Parametric query optimization (PQO) has as its goalthe prediction of optimal query execution plans based on historical results; withoutconsulting the query optimizer. We develop machine learning techniques that can accuratelymodel the output of a query optimizer. Our algorithms handle non-linear boundaries in planspace and achieve high prediction accuracy even when a limited amount of data is availablefor training. We use both predicted and actual query execution times for learning; and arethe first to demonstrate a total net win of a PQO method over a state-of-the-art queryoptimizer for some workloads. ReoptSMART realizes savings not only in optimization time;but also in query execution time; for an over-all improvement by more than an order of …,*,2008,2
Fides: Towards a platform for responsible data science,Julia Stoyanovich; Bill Howe; Serge Abiteboul; Gerome Miklau; Arnaud Sahuguet; Gerhard Weikum,Issues of responsible data analysis and use are coming to the forefront of the discourse indata science research and practice; with most significant efforts to date on the part of thedata mining; machine learning; and security and privacy communities. In these fields; theresearch has been focused on analyzing the fairness; accountability and transparency (FAT)properties of specific algorithms and their outputs. Although these issues are most apparentin the social sciences where fairness is interpreted in terms of the distribution of resourcesacross protected groups; management of bias in source data affects a variety of fields.Consider climate change studies that require representative data from geographicallydiverse regions; or supply chain analyses that require data that represents the diversity ofproducts and customers.

Querying probabilistic preferences in databases,Batya Kenig; Benny Kimelfeld; Haoyue Ping; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract We propose a novel framework wherein probabilistic preferences can be naturallyrepresented and analyzed in a probabilistic relational database. The framework augmentsthe relational schema with a special type of a relation symbol---a preference symbol. Adeterministic instance of this symbol holds a collection of binary relations. Abstractly; theprobabilistic variant is a probability space over databases of the augmented form (ie;probabilistic database). Effectively; each instance of a preference symbol can berepresented as a collection of parametric preference distributions such as Mallows. Weestablish positive and negative complexity results for evaluating Conjunctive Queries (CQs)over databases where preferences are represented in the Repeated Insertion Model (RIM);Mallows being a special case. We show how CQ evaluation reduces to a novel inference …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,1

Synthetic Data for Social Good,Bill Howe; Julia Stoyanovich; Haoyue Ping; Bernease Herman; Matt Gee,Abstract: Data for good implies unfettered access to data. But data owners must beconservative about how; when; and why they share data or risk violating the trust of thepeople they aim to help; losing their funding; or breaking the law. Data sharing agreementscan help prevent privacy violations; but require a level of specificity that is premature duringpreliminary discussions; and can take over a year to establish.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.08874,2017,*
Zooming in on NYC taxi data with Portal,Julia Stoyanovich; Matthew Gilbride; Vera Zaychik Moffitt,Abstract: In this paper we develop a methodology for analyzing transportation data atdifferent levels of temporal and geographic granularity; and apply our methodology to theTLC Trip Record Dataset; made publicly available by the NYC Taxi & LimousineCommission. This data is naturally represented by a set of trajectories; annotated with timeand with additional information such as passenger count and cost. We analyze TLC data toidentify hotspots; which point to lack of convenient public transportation options; and popularroutes; which motivate ride-sharing solutions or addition of a bus route. Our methodology isbased on using a system called Portal; which implements efficient representations andprincipled analysis methods for evolving graphs. Portal is implemented on top of ApacheSpark; a popular distributed data processing system; is inter-operable with other Spark …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06176,2017,*
Temporal graph algebra,Vera Zaychik Moffitt; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract Graph representations underlie many modern computer applications; capturing thestructure of such diverse networks as the Internet; personal associations; roads; sensors;and metabolic pathways. While analysis of static graphs is a well-explored field; newemphasis is being placed on understanding and representing the ways in which networkschange over time. Current research is delving into graph evolution rate and mechanisms;the impact of specific events on network evolution; and spatial and spatio-temporal patterns.However; systematic support for evolving graph querying and analytics still lacks. Our goal isto fill this gap; giving users an ability to concisely express a wide range of common analysistasks.

Smart Monitor System For Automatic Anomaly Detection@ Baidu,Xianping Qu,Abstract: Billions of requests are supported by hundreds of thousands of servers in Baidu.So many servers and modules bring a huge challenge to engineers for anomaly detection.When an anomaly occurs; various alarms and incidents are sent to engineers. It is verydifficult to find the root cause based on large non-organized monitoring data and alarms.Thus; we tried to build a smarter monitoring system named BIMS (Baidu IntelligentMonitoring System) to help engineers to analyze the problems and give the most possiblereasons for important anomaly such as revenue loss.,*,2015,*
Learning to explore scientific workflow repositories,Julia Stoyanovich; Paramveer Dhillon; Susan B Davidson; Brian Lyons,Abstract Scientific workflows are gaining popularity; and repositories of workflows arestarting to emerge. In this paper we describe TopicsExplorer; a data exploration approachfor myExperiment. org; a collaborative platform for the exchange of scientific workflows andexperimental plans. Our approach uses a variant of topic modeling with tags as features;and generates a browsable view of the repository. TopicsExplorer has been fully integratedinto the open-source platform of myExperiment. org; and is available to users at www.myexperiment. org/topics. We also present our recently developed personalizationcomponent that customizes topics based on user feedback. Finally; we discuss our ongoingperformance optimization efforts that make computing and managing personalized topicviews of the myExperiment. org repository feasible.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,*
Rank-Aware Subspace Clustering for Structured Datasets,Julia Stoyanovich; Sihem Amer-Yahia,ABSTRACT In online applications such as Match. com and Trulia. com users definestructured profiles in order to find potentially interesting matches. Typically; profiles areevaluated against large datasets and produce thousands of matches. In addition to filtering;users also specify ranking in their profile; and matches are returned in the form of a rankedlist. Top results in ranked lists are typically homogeneous; which hinders data exploration.For example; a user looking for 1-or 2-bedroom apartments sorted by price will see a largenumber of cheap 1-bedrooms in undesirable neighborhoods before seeing any apartmentwith different characteristics. An alternative to ranking is to group matches on commonattribute values (eg; cheap 1-bedrooms in good neighborhoods; 2-bedrooms with 2 baths).However; not all groups will be of interest to the user given the ranking criteria. We argue …,*,2009,*
Schema polynomials and applications,Kenneth A Ross; Julia Stoyanovich,Abstract Conceptual complexity is emerging as a new bottleneck as data-base developers;application developers; and database administrators struggle to design and comprehendlarge; complex schemas. The simplicity and conciseness of a schema depends critically onthe idioms available to express the schema. We propose a formal conceptual schemarepresentation language that combines different design formalisms; and allows schemamanipulation that exposes the strengths of each of these formalisms. We demonstrate howthe schema factorization framework can be used to generate relational; object-oriented; andfaceted physical schemas; allowing a wider exploration of physical schema alternatives thantraditional methodologies. We illustrate the potential practical benefits of schemafactorization by showing that simple heuristics can significantly reduce the size of a real …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,*

A Database Framework for Probabilistic Preferences,Batya Kenig; Benny Kimelfeld; Haoyue Ping; Julia Stoyanovich,Preferences are statements about the relative quality or desirability of items. Ever largeramounts of preference information are being collected and analyzed in a variety of domains;including recommendation systems [2; 16; 18]; polling and election analysis [3; 6; 7; 15]; andbioinformatics [1; 11; 19]. Preferences are often inferred from indirect input (eg; a ranked listmay be inferred from individual choices); and are therefore uncertain in nature. Thismotivates a rich body of work on uncertain preference models in the statistics literature [14].More recently; the machine learning community has been developing methods for effectivemodeling and efficient inference over preferences; with the Mallows model [13] receivingparticular attention [4; 5; 12; 17]. In this paper; we take the position that preference modelingand analysis should be accommodated within a general-purpose probabilistic database …,*,*,*
