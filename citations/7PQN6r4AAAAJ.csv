A reduction in electron heating is observed when the laserpolarization is changed from linear to circular; leading to a pronounced peak in the fullyionized carbon spectrum at the optimum foil thickness of 5.3 nm. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations reveal that those C 6+ ions are for the first time dominantly accelerated in aphase-stable way by the laser radiation pressure.,Physical Review Letters,2009,439
Enhanced laser-driven ion acceleration in the relativistic transparency regime,Andreas Henig; Daniel Kiefer; K Markey; DC Gautier; KA Flippo; S Letzring; RP Johnson; T Shimada; L Yin; BJ Albright; KJ Bowers; JC Fernández; Sergey G Rykovanov; H-C Wu; M Zepf; Daniel Jung; V Kh Liechtenstein; Joerg Schreiber; Dietrich Habs; BM Hegelich,Abstract We report on the acceleration of ion beams from ultrathin diamondlike carbon foilsof thickness 50; 30; and 10 nm irradiated by ultrahigh contrast laser pulses at intensities of∼7× 10 19 W/cm 2. An unprecedented maximum energy of 185 MeV (15 MeV/u) for fullyionized carbon atoms is observed at the optimum thickness of 30 nm. The enhancedacceleration is attributed to self-induced transparency; leading to strong volumetric heatingof the classically overdense electron population in the bulk of the target. Our experimentalresults are supported by both particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and an analytical model.,Physical review letters,2009,202
Ion acceleration using relativistic pulse shaping in near-critical-density plasmas,JH Bin; WJ Ma; HY Wang; MJV Streeter; C Kreuzer; D Kiefer; M Yeung; S Cousens; PS Foster; B Dromey; XQ Yan; R Ramis; Jürgen Meyer-ter-Vehn; M Zepf; Jörg Schreiber,Abstract Ultraintense laser pulses with a few-cycle rising edge are ideally suited toaccelerating ions from ultrathin foils; and achieving such pulses in practice represents aformidable challenge. We show that such pulses can be obtained using sufficiently strongand well-controlled relativistic nonlinearities in spatially well-defined near-critical-densityplasmas. The resulting ultraintense pulses with an extremely steep rising edge give rise tosignificantly enhanced carbon ion energies consistent with a transition to radiation pressureacceleration.,Physical review letters,2015,83

Recent theoretical work; however; has identified a new interaction regime inwhich dense electron nanobunches are formed at the plasma–vacuum boundary resulting incoherent XUV radiation by coherent synchrotron emission 7; 8 (CSE). Our experimentsenable the isolation of CSE from competing processes; demonstrating that electronnanobunch formation does indeed occur.

Monoenergetic ion beam generation by driving ion solitary waves with circularly polarized laser light,Daniel Jung; L Yin; BJ Albright; DC Gautier; Rainer Hörlein; Daniel Kiefer; Andreas Henig; R Johnson; S Letzring; S Palaniyappan; R Shah; T Shimada; XQ Yan; KJ Bowers; T Tajima; JC Fernández; Dietrich Habs; BM Hegelich,Abstract Experimental data from the Trident Laser facility is presented showingquasimonoenergetic carbon ions from nm-scaled foil targets with an energy spread of as lowas±15% at 35 MeV. These results and high-resolution kinetic simulations show laseracceleration of quasimonoenergetic ion beams by the generation of ion solitons withcircularly polarized laser pulses (500 fs; λ= 1054 nm). The conversion efficiency intomonoenergetic ions is increased by an order of magnitude compared with previousexperimental results; representing an important step towards applications such as ion fastignition.,Physical review letters,2011,76
Efficient ion acceleration by collective laser-driven electron dynamics with ultra-thin foil targets,S Steinke; Andreas Henig; M Schnürer; T Sokollik; PV Nickles; D Jung; Daniel Kiefer; Rainer Hörlein; Jörg Schreiber; T Tajima; XQ Yan; M Hegelich; Jürgen Meyer-ter-Vehn; W Sandner; Dietrich Habs,Abstract Experiments on ion acceleration by irradiation of ultra-thin diamond-like carbon(DLC) foils; with thicknesses well below the skin depth; irradiated with laser pulses of ultra-high contrast and linear polarization; are presented. A maximum energy of 13 MeV forprotons and 71 MeV for carbon ions is observed with a conversion efficiency of~ 10%. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations reveal that the increase in ion energies can beattributed to a dominantly collective rather than thermal motion of the foil electrons; when thetarget becomes transparent for the incident laser pulse.,Laser and Particle Beams,2010,75
Dense laser-driven electron sheets as relativistic mirrors for coherent production of brilliant X-ray and γ-ray beams,Dietrich Habs; M Hegelich; Jörg Schreiber; M Gross; Andreas Henig; D Kiefer; D Jung,Abstract Several techniques exist to obtain brilliant X-ray beams by coherent reflection fromrelativistic electrons (E e= γ mc 2) with Doppler frequency upshift of 4 γ 2. We describe anew approach starting with an ultra-thin solid target. Larger 'driver'-laser intensities with highcontrast are required to produce dense electron sheets. Their acceleration in vacuum resultsin a transverse momentum component besides the dominant longitudinal momentumcomponent. The counter-propagating 'production'laser for optimum Doppler boost in X-rayproduction by reflection has to be injected opposite to the electron direction and not oppositeto the driver laser. Different measures to increase the reflectivity of the electron sheet vialaser trapping or free-electron-laser-like micro-bunching are discussed; extending thephoton energy into the MeV range. Here; first-order estimates are given.,Applied Physics B,2008,67

In contrast toconventional accelerators; laser-driven ion acceleration offers a potentially more compactand cost-effective means of delivering ions for radiotherapy. Here; we show that bycombining advanced acceleration using nanometer thin targets and beam transport; trulynanosecond quasi-monoenergetic proton bunches can be generated with a table-top lasersystem; delivering single shot doses up to 7 Gy to living cells. Although in their infancy; laser-ion accelerators allow studying fast radiobiological processes as demonstrated here bymeasurements of the relative biological effectiveness of nanosecond proton bunches inhuman tumor cells.,Applied Physics Letters,2012,60
Experimental demonstration of particle energy; conversion efficiency and spectral shape required for ion-based fast ignition,BM Hegelich; D Jung; BJ Albright; JC Fernandez; DC Gautier; C Huang; TJ Kwan; S Letzring; S Palaniyappan; RC Shah; H-C Wu; L Yin; A Henig; R Hörlein; D Kiefer; J Schreiber; XQ Yan; T Tajima; D Habs; B Dromey; JJ Honrubia,Abstract Research on fusion fast ignition (FI) initiated by laser-driven ion beams has madesubstantial progress in the last years. Compared with electrons; FI based on a beam of quasi-monoenergetic ions has the advantage of a more localized energy deposition; and stifferparticle transport; bringing the required total beam energy close to the theoretical minimum.Due to short pulse laser drive; the ion beam can easily deliver the 200 TW power required toignite the compressed D–T fuel. In integrated calculations we recently simulated ion-basedFI targets with high fusion gain targets and a proof of principle experiment [1]. Thesesimulations identify three key requirements for the success of ion-driven fast ignition (IFI):(1)the generation of a sufficiently high-energetic ion beam (≈ 400–500 MeV for C); with (2)less than 20% energy spread at (3) more than 10% conversion efficiency of laser to beam …,Nuclear Fusion,2011,57

A highly directed proton beam with plateau-shaped spectrumextending to energies up to 8 MeV is observed in the laser propagation direction. This beamarises from acceleration in a converging shock launched by the laser; which is confirmed by3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The temporal evolution of the shock-frontcurvature shows excellent agreement with a two-dimensional radiation pressure model.,Physical review letters,2009,57
Relativistic electron mirrors from nanoscale foils for coherent frequency upshift to the extreme ultraviolet,Daniel Kiefer; M Yeung; T Dzelzainis; PS Foster; SG Rykovanov; C LS Lewis; RS Marjoribanks; H Ruhl; Dietrich Habs; Jörg Schreiber; M Zepf; B Dromey,Abstract Reflecting light from a mirror moving close to the speed of light has beenenvisioned as a route towards producing bright X-ray pulses since Einstein's seminal workon special relativity. For an ideal relativistic mirror; the peak power of the reflected radiationcan substantially exceed that of the incident radiation due to the increase in photon energyand accompanying temporal compression. Here we demonstrate for the first time that denserelativistic electron mirrors can be created from the interaction of a high-intensity laser pulsewith a freestanding; nanometre-scale thin foil. The mirror structures are shown to shift thefrequency of a counter-propagating laser pulse coherently from the infrared to the extremeultraviolet with an efficiency> 10 4 times higher than in the case of incoherent scattering. Ourresults elucidate the reflection process of laser-generated electron mirrors and give clear …,Nature communications,2013,48

We observed spatially and energetically separatedprotons and carbon ions that accumulate to pronounced peaks around 2 MeV containing asmuch as 6.5% of the laser energy. Based on particle-in-cell simulation; we illustrate that anearly separation of heavier carbon ions and lighter protons creates a stable interface that ismaintained beyond the end of the radiation pressure dominated acceleration process.,Physical Review Special Topics-Accelerators and Beams,2013,45
Development of a high resolution and high dispersion Thomson parabola,Daniel Jung; Rainer Hörlein; Daniel Kiefer; S Letzring; DC Gautier; U Schramm; C Hübsch; R Öhm; BJ Albright; JC Fernandez; Dietrich Habs; BM Hegelich,Here; we report on the development of a novel high resolution and high dispersion Thomsonparabola for simultaneously resolving protons and low-Z ions of more than 100MeV/nucleon necessary to explore novel laser ion acceleration schemes. High electric andmagnetic fields enable energy resolutions of Δ E/E< 5% at 100 MeV/nucleon and impedepremature merging of different ion species at low energies on the detector plane.

A distinct quasi-monoenergetic electron spectrum peakedat 30 MeV is observed at a target thickness as thin as 5 nm which is in contrast to theobservations of wide spectral distributions for thicker targets. At the same time; a substantialdrop in laser-accelerated ion energies is found. The experimental findings give firstindication that relativistic electron sheets can be generated from ultra-thin foils which infuture may be used to generate brilliant X-ray beams by the coherent reflection of a secondlaser.,The European Physical Journal D,2009,45

Harmonic generation by reflecting internal waves,Bruce Rodenborn; D Kiefer; HP Zhang; Harry L Swinney,The generation of internal gravity waves by tidal flow over topography is an importantoceanic process that redistributes tidal energy in the ocean. Internal waves reflect fromboundaries; creating harmonics and mixing. We use laboratory experiments and two-dimensional numerical simulations of the Navier–Stokes equations to determine the value ofthe topographic slope that gives the most intense generation of second harmonic waves inthe reflection process. The results from our experiments and simulations agree well but differmarkedly from theoretical predictions by SA Thorpe [“On the reflection of a train of finiteamplitude waves from a uniform slope;” J.

Signatures of the Unruh effect via high-power; short-pulse lasers,PG Thirolf; D Habs; A Henig; D Jung; D Kiefer; C Lang; J Schreiber; C Maia; G Schaller; R Schützhold; T Tajima,Abstract The ultra-high fields of high-power short-pulse lasers are expected to contribute tounderstanding fundamental properties of the quantum vacuum and quantum theory in verystrong fields. For example; the neutral QED vacuum breaks down at the Schwinger fieldstrength of 1.3× 10 18 V/m; where a virtual e+ e-pair gains its rest mass energy over aCompton wavelength and materializes as a real pair. At such an ultra-high field strength; anelectron experiences an acceleration of a S= 2× 10 28 g and hence fundamentalphenomena such as the long predicted Unruh effect start to play a role. The Unruh effectimplies that the accelerated electron experiences the vacuum as a thermal bath with theUnruh temperature. In its accelerated frame the electron scatters photons off the thermalbath; corresponding to the emission of an entangled pair of photons in the laboratory …,The European Physical Journal D,2009,30

Optimization of Laser‐Generated Ion Beams,S Steinke; M Schnürer; T Sokollik; AA Andreev; PV Nickles; Andreas Henig; Rainer Hörlein; Daniel Kiefer; D Jung; Jörg Schreiber; Toshiki Tajima; M Hegelich; Dietrich Habs; W Sandner,Abstract In this paper the route towards the current optimum of laser generated ion beams bysubsequently changing the important parameters such as target thickness; laser pulsecontrast; angle of incidence and laser pulse polarization is sketched. Beginning withparameters of isothermal target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA); we reached the regimewhere the plasma expansion can be described adiabatically and results in a symmetric ionacceleration. Further we demonstrated a way to phase match the accelerating electronpopulation with the ions; namely coherent acceleration of ions by laser pulses (CAIL); whichfinally lead to radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) if the laser polarization was changedfrom linear to circular. These findings of ion acceleration with transparent solid targets areadditionally supported by analyzing the optical properties of the transmitted laser pulse (© …,Contributions to Plasma Physics,2011,7
Performance and behavior of seals for pneumatic spool valves,Guido Belforte; Marcello Conte; A Manuello; Luigi Mazza,This article presents a seal development approach that takes actual operating conditions(mounting; sealed pressure; lubricating conditions); seal material; and counterpartmachining tolerances into account. The approach was applied to the design of seals for acommercial pneumatic spool valve. A single seal geometry and two seat configurations werespecified on the basis of finite element analysis and experimental tests. The goal was todevelop a compact low-friction seal capable of operating dry in order to avoid the use ofgrease. The investigation focused on seals that are somewhat shorter (ie; with a smallerradial height to permit application on new valve models) than existing commercial units butwhose performance is not inferior. Prototypes of the new seal were manufactured andtested; and a specific device for measuring seal friction force and sealing was developed …,Tribology Transactions,2011,7

Experimental investigations under different loads which also include thelimit state under accidental conditions are the basis for the implementation of theseproblems in finite element codes.

With a laser focal spot size of 10 μ m full width halfmaximum (FWHM) the sphere diameter was varied between 520 nm and 19.3 μ m.Maximum proton energies of∼ 25 MeV are achieved for targets matching the focal spot sizeof 10 μ m in diameter or being slightly smaller. For smaller spheres the kinetic energydistributions of protons become nonmonotonic; indicating a change in the acceleratingmechanism from ambipolar expansion towards a regime dominated by effects caused byCoulomb repulsion of ions.

Szidat's rule re-tested: relationships between flea and host phylogenetic clade ranks in four biogeographic realms,Boris R Krasnov; Daniel Kiefer; Elizabeth M Warburton; Irina S Khokhlova,Summary We tested Szidat's rule (the more primitive the host; the more primitive theparasites it harbours) by analysing the relationships between phylogenetic clade ranks offleas and their small mammalian hosts in four biogeographic realms (Afrotropics; Neotropics;Nearctic and Palearctic). From the host perspective; we tested the association between hostclade rank and the mean clade rank of all fleas collected from this host. From the fleaperspective; we tested the relationships between flea clade rank and the mean clade rank ofhosts on which this flea was recorded. First; we tested whether the analysis of therelationships between host and flea clade ranks should be controlled for phylogeneticdependence among either host or flea species. Then; we tested for the associationsbetween host and flea clade ranks separately for each realm using either a phylogenetic …,Parasitology,2016,3
Relativistic Electron Mirrors: from High Intensity Laser–Nanofoil Interactions,Daniel Kiefer,A dense sheet of electrons accelerated to close to the speed of light can act as a tuneablemirror that can generate bright bursts of laser-like radiation in the short wavelength rangesimply via the reflection of a counter-propagating laser pulse. This thesis investigates thegeneration of such a relativistic electron mirror structure in a series of experimentsaccompanied by computer simulations. It is shown that such relativistic mirror can indeed becreated from the interaction of a high-intensity laser pulse with a nanometer-scale; ultrathinfoil. The reported work gives a intriguing insight into the complex dynamics of high-intensitylaser-nanofoil interactions and constitutes a major step towards the development of arelativistic mirror; which could potentially generate bright burst of X-rays on a micro-scale.,*,2014,3
PACE-1450-Experimental investigation of the crack behaviour of prestressed concrete containment walls considering the prestressing loss due to aging,Nico Herrmann; Lutz Gerlach; Harald Müller; Christoph Niklasch; Daniela Kiefer; Yann Le Pape; Christophe Bento,1 ABSTRACT As an intermediate sized experiment the “PACE 1450-ExperimentalCampaign” aims to investigate the behaviour of a curved specimen which is representativefor a 1450 MWe nuclear power plant containment under accidental loading conditions. Thereinforcement layout of the specimen is very similar to the original geometry and consistsmainly of meshes of reinforcement bars near the inner and outer surface and fourprestressing cables; each of them consisting of 37 strands within ducts in the circumferentialdirection. An initial prestressing of the specimen of 12 MPa in this direction is realised insuch a way that decreasing the prestressing force for the purpose of simulating the aging ofthe structure is possible. In order to obtain information about the behaviour of thecontainment wall segment under the chosen conditions; the specimen is equipped with …,*,2009,3
Considering some undesired effects due to dense packing in supported coplanar waveguide MMICs by using combined methods,Ingo Wolff; D Kiefer; SS Bedair,Combined methods are used to predict some undesired effects due to dense packing insupported coplanar waveguide monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). Theseinclude the effects due to the presence of an adjacent grounded side wall or the presence ofanother adjacent line. The presented information can be used to consider these effectsduring the design stage or to help in designing MMICs in which these effects can be ignored.Numerical results are presented in order to demonstrate these effects.,Microwave Symposium Digest; 1989.; IEEE MTT-S International,1989,3

We compare the transport of hot electrons produced during the interactionof an ultra intense laser pulse through the structured target and flat targets. Results confirmthat effective collimation of electron beams is realized by employing structured targets whichhave a radial discontinuity in the atomic number Z.

Reproductive consequences of female size in haematophagous ectoparasites,Daniel Kiefer; Elizabeth M Warburton; Irina S Khokhlova; Boris R Krasnov,ABSTRACT To test relationships between maternal size; egg size and size of new offspring;we studied (a) the effect of maternal size on egg size and number; and maternal survivalafter oviposition and (b) the effect of egg size on the duration of development and newimago size in three flea species (Xenopsylla ramesis; Synosternus cleopatrae; Parapulexchephrenis) with varying host and habitat specificity. In general; the number and size of eggsas well as total egg volume appeared to be independent of maternal body size. There wasno trade-off between egg number and size. However; female body size was related to post-oviposition survival; with larger females surviving longer after oviposition than smallerfemales. In addition; females that produced more eggs died faster after oviposition in X.ramesis but not in the two other species.

Mass distributions change signiﬁcantly as a function of incident beamenergy. The asymmetric ﬁssion probability increases at sub-barrier energy. Thephenomenon is interpreted as an enhanced quasiﬁssion probability owing to orientationeffects on fusion and/or quasiﬁssion. The evaporation residue (ER) cross sections weremeasured in the reactions of 30 Si+ 238 U and 34 S+ 238 U to obtain information on fusion.In the latter reaction; signiﬁcant suppression of fusion was implied.

At peak powers; already exceeding 10^ 22 W/cm^2; in virtually every experiment in relativistic laser physics; the laser pulse interacts with amore or less extended and heated plasma; due to prepulses and ASE.

Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations are carried out in 2 and 3dimensions (2D and 3D) to compare fast proton spectra. We find very different final kineticenergies in 2D and 3D simulations. We show that they are caused by the different Coulombfields in 2D and 3D. We propose a correction scheme for the proton energies to test thishypothesis. In the case of sub-focus diameter targets comparison of corrected 2D energieswith 3D results show good agreement.

Divergence of laser-driven ion beams from nanometer thick foils,JH Bin; WJ Ma; K Allinger; HY Wang; D Kiefer; S Reinhardt; P Hilz; K Khrennikov; S Karsch; XQ Yan; F Krausz; T Tajima; D Habs; J Schreiber,We report on experimental studies of divergence of proton beams from nanometer thickdiamond-like carbon (DLC) foils irradiated by an intense laser with high contrast. Protonbeams with extremely small divergence (half angle) of 2° are observed in addition with aremarkably well-collimated feature over the whole energy range; showing one order ofmagnitude reduction of the divergence angle in comparison to the results from μm thicktargets. We demonstrate that this reduction arises from a steep longitudinal electron densitygradient and an exponentially decaying transverse profile at the rear side of the ultrathinfoils.

Advanced techniques in laser-ion accceleration: conversion efficiency; beam distribution and energy scaling in the break-out afterburner regime,Daniel Jung; Bjorn M Hegelich; Brian Albright; L Yin; C Gautier; Randall Johnson; S Letzring; R Shah; S Palaniyappan; T Shimada; JC Fernandez; D Kiefer; D Habs; Rainer Hoerlein,In the past ten years target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA 1) has been studiedintensively; experimentally as well as theoretically. TNSA; however; predominantlyaccelerates protons by virtue of its acceleration mechanism. Recently; improved lasercontrast and steadily increasing laser intensities made novel acceleration mechanisms suchas the radiation pressure acceleration (RPA2) or the Break-Out Afterburner (BOA 3; 4; 5)accessible experimentally. These mechanisms efficiently couple laser momentum into alltarget ion species; making these mechanisms a promising and competitive alternative toconventional rf-accelerators on a much wider basis.

As both the on target intensity and the laser contrast areincreasing; new physics regime are becoming accessible and new effects materialize whichin turn enable a host of applications. A first example is the realization of interactions in thetransperent-overdense regime (TOR); which is reached by interacting a highly relativistic(ao> lO); ultra high contrast laser pulse with a solid density; nanometer target. Here; a stilloverdense target is turned transperent to the laser by the relativistic mass increase of theelectrons; increasing the skin depth beyond the target thickness and thus enablingvolumetric interaction of the laser with the entire target instead of only a small interactionregion at the critical density surface.

However; simulations have shown susceptibility to the radiation pressuredriven Rayleigh-Taylor instability [1; 2]. Here we report on experiments performed with theVULCAN Petawatt laser at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory using intensities up to 10^ 21Wcm-2 in linear polarisation. Peaks within the C^ 6+ spectra indicate RPA acceleration ofthe foils. Most remarkably though; strong spatial modulation is observed in the recordedproton beams. The form and extent of these modulations suggest Rayleigh-Taylor break-upof the foil. Simulations provide further support for these conclusions.[1] APL Robinson et al.;NJP; 10; 013021 (2008)[2] F.

Proposed Studies Of Radiation Damping In Laser Interaction With An Ultra‐thin; Coherently Reflecting Electron Sheet; Regarded As A Macro‐particle,D Habs; D Kiefer; A Henig; R Hörlein; J Schreiber; K Allinger; J Bin; P Thirolf; C Lang; T Yamazaki; K Homma,We introduce the concept of an ultra‐thin; dense electron sheet as a macro‐particle—similarto an electron microbunch of an FEL—where N electrons coherently reflect in the inner restframe of the bunch. This ultra‐thin electron sheet is pushed out off an ultra‐thin Diamond‐Like Carbon (DLC) target by a driver laser and acts as a relativistic flying mirror [1; 2] for aproduction laser. The space charge forces of the electron sheet are balanced by the trappingfields of the driver laser; of the remaining ion sheet and of the counter propagatingproduction laser; resulting in longitudinally bound electrons. Like in the Mössbauer effect ofnuclei the photon recoil is taken up by the N electrons of the macro‐particle.

However the laser parameters shouldmeet tight specifications to make the scheme successful and reliable. In order to reach thisgoal the ATLAS laser at MPQ has undergone a major upgrade. The pulse length has beenreduced to 25 fs to fit perfectly to the half plasma-wavelength (by conventional densities inthe order of 10 18 cm-3). Pulse energy has been increased to 2 J to extend the accelerationlength (and hence output electron energies). Automatic beam alignment system has beenintroduced to stabilize the laser pointing; which is a key feature for the stability of final laserparameters; which in turn leads to increase in field reproducibility on target.

Efficient ion acceleration in the laser transparency regime,Sven Steinke; Matthias Schnuerer; Thomas Sokollik; Peter Nickles; Wolfgang Sandner; Andreas Henig; Rainer Hoerlein; Daniel Kiefer; Dietrich Habs; Xueqing Yan; Toshiki Tajima,Experiments on ion acceleration from ultra-thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) foils withthicknesses below the skin depth (ie transparent); irradiated by ultra-high contrast laserpulses are presented. A maximum energy of 13 MeV for protons and 71 MeV for carbon ionsis observed with an overall energy conversion efficiency of∝ 10%. The increase in ionenergies can be attributed to a dominantly collective rather than thermal motion of the foilelectrons leading to an observed reduction in electron heating and in case of circularpolarization to a pronounced peak in the C 6+ spectrum. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell(PIC) simulations reveal that those C 6+ ions are for the first time dominantly accelerated bythe laser radiation pressure.,Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft,2010,*

The dominant ion acceleration mechanism is known as targetnormal sheath acceleration (TNSA); although easy accessible it suffers from a low energyconversion efficiency. Recently reported maximum ion energies 1 are in the range of a fewtens of MeV; which is well below the energies needed for most applications. Recentlyproposed acceleration mechanisms utilize ultra-high contrast laser pulses and ultra-thinsolid targets allowing for generation of ions in the GeV range from intense laser-plasmainteraction.

We present ourresults on the acceleration of proton/ion bunches created by ultra-short laser pulses of ultra-thin (d< λ) foils. To approach this regime; where the target becomes more and moretransparent for the laser; we developed a so called double-plasma mirror to increase theintensity contrast of the laser pulse by several orders of magnitude up to 10 12. It is shownhow the features of the proton/ion bunches depend on the laser pulse parameters; likeintensity and contrast of the laser pulse.

Nonlinear Characteristics of Internal Wave Reflection from Sloping Topography,Bruce Rodenborn; Daniel Kiefer; Hepeng Zhang; Harry L Swinney,Abstract Internal waves are generated in the oceans by surface waves and abyssal tidal flowover the ocean floor. The interaction among these waves and their reflection from the oceanfloor are believed to cause mixing necessary to support thermohaline circulation. Thereflection of internal waves is often treated as a linear or a weakly nonlinear and inviscidproblem; but the full nonlinear effects generate higher harmonics and mixing. We useParticle Image Velocimetry to study the reflection of internal waves from a sloping bottomboundary in a laboratory tank. The experiments are modeled using a 2-D pseudo-spectralnumerical simulation that solves the nonlinear problem in the Boussinesq approximation.The kinetic energy density of harmonics generated upon wave reflection from the boundaryis examined as a function of the boundary angle and wave angle.

Nonlinear interaction of internal wave beams upon reflection at a sloping boundary,Daniel Kiefer,Internal gravity waves are supported by any fluid of varying density in height and propagateobliquely through the fluid with an angle determined by the wave frequency and the densitygradient of the fluid stratification. Internal waves are suspected to play a key role in thedynamics of the ocean. Despite their great oceanographic importance; the dynamics of theinternal waves are widely unknown. When an internal wave reflects from a slopingboundary; the nonlinear interaction of incoming and reflected beams gives rise to additionalhigher harmonic waves.

Here; strong coulomb fields immediately set up during the lasertarget interaction counteract the ponderomotive force of the laser and thus suppresssignificant energy gain of electrons in the laser field. However; this scenario drasticallychanges when the areal density of the target is significantly reduced which can be achievedwith a target of only a few nm thickness.
