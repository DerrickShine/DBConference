Exploiting geographical influence for collaborative point-of-interest recommendation,Mao Ye; Peifeng Yin; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik-Lun Lee,Abstract In this paper; we aim to provide a point-of-interests (POI) recommendation servicefor the rapid growing location-based social networks (LBSNs); eg; Foursquare; Whrrl; etc.Our idea is to explore user preference; social influence and geographical influence for POIrecommendations. In addition to deriving user preference based on user-basedcollaborative filtering and exploring social influence from friends; we put a special emphasison geographical influence due to the spatial clustering phenomenon exhibited in user check-in activities of LBSNs. We argue that the geographical influence among POIs plays animportant role in user check-in behaviors and model it by power law distribution.Accordingly; we develop a collaborative recommendation algorithm based on geographicalinfluence based on naive Bayesian. Furthermore; we propose a unified POI …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,576
Prediction-based strategies for energy saving in object tracking sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Julian Winter; Wang-Chien Lee,In order to fully realize the potential of sensor networks; energy awareness should beincorporated into every stage of the network design and operation. In this paper; we addressthe energy management issue in a sensor network killer application-object tracking sensornetworks (OTSNs). Based on the fact that the movements of the tracked objects aresometimes predictable; we propose a prediction-based energy saving scheme; called PES;to reduce the energy consumption for object tracking under acceptable conditions. Wecompare PES against the basic schemes we proposed in the paper to explore the conditionsunder which PES is most desired. We also test the effect of some parameters related to thesystem workload; object moving behavior and sensing operations on PES through extensivesimulation.

Location recommendation for location-based social networks,Mao Ye; Peifeng Yin; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract In this paper; we study the research issues in realizing location recommendationservices for large-scale location-based social networks; by exploiting the social andgeographical characteristics of users and locations/places. Through our analysis on adataset collected from Foursquare; a popular location-based social networking system; weobserve that there exists strong social and geospatial ties among users and their favoritelocations/places in the system. Accordingly; we develop a friend-based collaborative filtering(FCF) approach for location recommendation based on collaborative ratings of places madeby social friends. Moreover; we propose a variant of FCF technique; namely Geo-MeasuredFCF (GM-FCF); based on heuristics derived from observed geospatial characteristics in theFoursquare dataset. Finally; the evaluation results show that the proposed family of FCF …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2010,346
Real-time automatic tag recommendation,Yang Song; Ziming Zhuang; Huajing Li; Qiankun Zhao; Jia Li; Wang-Chien Lee; C Lee Giles,Abstract Tags are user-generated labels for entities. Existing research on tagrecommendation either focuses on improving its accuracy or on automating the process;while ignoring the efficiency issue. We propose a highly-automated novel framework for real-time tag recommendation. The tagged training documents are treated as triplets of (words;docs; tags); and represented in two bipartite graphs; which are partitioned into clusters bySpectral Recursive Embedding (SRE). Tags in each topical cluster are ranked by our novelranking algorithm. A two-way Poisson Mixture Model (PMM) is proposed to model thedocument distribution into mixture components within each cluster and aggregate words intoword clusters simultaneously. A new document is classified by the mixture model based onits posterior probabilities so that tags are recommended according to their ranks …,Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008,300

Approaching the skyline in Z order,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Huajing Li; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Given a set of multidimensional data points; skyline query retrieves a set of datapoints that are not dominated by any other points. This query is useful for multi-preferenceanalysis and decision making. By analyzing the skyline query; we observe a closeconnection between Z-order curve and skyline processing strategies and propose to use anew index structure called ZBtree; to index and store data points based on Z-order curve.We develop a suite of novel and efficient skyline algorithms; which scale very well to datadimensionality and cardinality; including (1) ZSearch; which processes skyline queries andsupports progressive result delivery;(2) ZUpdate; which facilitates incremental skyline resultmaintenance; and (3) k-ZSearch; which answers k-dominant skyline query (a skyline variantthat retrieves a representative subset of skyline results).

Ir-tree: An efficient index for geographic document search,Zhisheng Li; Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lee; Xufa Wang,Given a geographic query that is composed of query keywords and a location; a geographicsearch engine retrieves documents that are the most textually and spatially relevant to thequery keywords and the location; respectively; and ranks the retrieved documents accordingto their joint textual and spatial relevances to the query. The lack of an efficient index thatcan simultaneously handle both the textual and spatial aspects of the documents makesexisting geographic search engines inefficient in answering geographic queries. In thispaper; we propose an efficient index; called IR-tree; that together with a top-k documentsearch algorithm facilitates four major tasks in document searches; namely; 1) spatialfiltering; 2) textual filtering; 3) relevance computation; and 4) document ranking in a fullyintegrated manner.

Semantic small world: An overlay network for peer-to-peer search,Mei Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam,For a peer-to-peer (P2P) system holding massive amount of data; efficient semantic basedsearch for resources (such as data or services) is a key determinant to its scalability. Thiswork presents the design of an overlay network; namely semantic small world (SSW); thatfacilitates efficient semantic based search in P2P systems. SSW is based on three innovativeideas: 1) small world network; 2) semantic clustering; 3) dimension reduction. Peers in SSWare clustered according to the semantics of their local data and self-organized as a smallworld overlay network. To address the maintenance issue of high dimensional overlaynetworks; a dynamic dimension reduction method; called adaptive space linearization; isused to construct a one-dimensional SSW that supports operations in the high dimensionalsemantic space.

We propose a dual prediction-based reporting mechanism (called DPR); in whichboth sensor nodes and the base station predict the future movements of the mobile objects.Transmissions of sensor readings are avoided as long as the predictions are consistent withthe real object movements.

Event-based social networks: linking the online and offline social worlds,Xingjie Liu; Qi He; Yuanyuan Tian; Wang-Chien Lee; John McPherson; Jiawei Han,Abstract Newly emerged event-based online social services; such as Meetup and Plancast;have experienced increased popularity and rapid growth. From these services; we observeda new type of social network-event-based social network (EBSN). An EBSN does not onlycontain online social interactions as in other conventional online social networks; but alsoincludes valuable offline social interactions captured in offline activities. By analyzing realdata collected from Meetup; we investigated EBSN properties and discovered many uniqueand interesting characteristics; such as heavy-tailed degree distributions and strong localityof social interactions. We subsequently studied the heterogeneous nature (co-existence ofboth online and offline social interactions) of EBSNs on two challenging problems:community detection and information flow. We found that communities detected in EBSNs …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,172

Many of those prediction techniques are developed based only ongeographic features of mobile users' trajectories. In this paper; we propose a novelapproach for predicting the next location of a user's movement based on both thegeographic and semantic features of users' trajectories. The core idea of our predictionmodel is based on a novel cluster-based prediction strategy which evaluates the nextlocation of a mobile user based on the frequent behaviors of similar users in the samecluster determined by analyzing users' common behavior in semantic trajectories. Through acomprehensive evaluation by experiments; our proposal is shown to deliver excellentperformance.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,169
Exploring social influence for recommendation: a generative model approach,Mao Ye; Xingjie Liu; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Social friendship has been shown beneficial for item recommendation for years.However; existing approaches mostly incorporate social friendship into recommendersystems by heuristics. In this paper; we argue that social influence between friends can becaptured quantitatively and propose a probabilistic generative model; called socialinfluenced selection (SIS); to model the decision making of item selection (eg; what book tobuy or where to dine). Based on SIS; we mine the social influence between linked friendsand the personal preferences of users through statistical inference. To address thechallenges arising from multiple layers of hidden factors in SIS; we develop a newparameter learning algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). Moreover; we showthat the mined social influence and user preferences are valuable for group …,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,161
Mining user similarity from semantic trajectories,Josh Jia-Ching Ying; Eric Hsueh-Chan Lu; Wang-Chien Lee; Tz-Chiao Weng; Vincent S Tseng,Abstract In recent years; research on measuring trajectory similarity has attracted a lot ofattentions. Most of similarities are defined based on the geographic features of mobile users'trajectories. However; trajectories geographically close may not necessarily be similarbecause the activities implied by nearby landmarks they pass through may be different. Inthis paper; we argue that a better similarity measurement should have taken into account thesemantics of trajectories. In this paper; we propose a novel approach for recommendingpotential friends based on users' semantic trajectories for location-based social networks.The core of our proposal is a novel trajectory similarity measurement; namely; MaximalSemantic Trajectory Pattern Similarity (MSTP-Similarity); which measures the semanticsimilarity between trajectories. Accordingly; we propose a user similarity measurement …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks,2010,160
On localized prediction for power efficient object tracking in sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Energy is one of the most critical constraints for sensor network applications. In this paper;we exploit the localized prediction paradigm for power-efficient object tracking sensornetwork. Localized prediction consists of a localized network architecture and a predictionmechanism called dual prediction; which achieve power savings by allowing most of thesensor nodes stay in sleep mode and by reducing the amount of long-range transmissions.Performance evaluation; based on mathematical analysis; shows that localized predictioncan significantly reduce the power consumption in object tracking sensor networks.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2003.

Protecting moving trajectories with dummies,Tun-Hao You; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Dummy-based anonymization techniques for protecting location privacy of mobile usershave been proposed in the literature. By generating dummies that move in humanliketrajectories; shows that location privacy of mobile users can be preserved. However; bymonitoring long-term movement patterns of users; the trajectories of mobile users can still beexposed. We argue that; once the trajectory of a user is identified; locations of the user isexposed. Thus; it's critical to protect the moving trajectories of mobile users in order topreserve user location privacy. We propose two schemes that generate consistentmovement patterns in a long run. Guided by three parameters in user specified privacyprofile; namely; short-term disclosure; long-term disclosure and distance deviation; theproposed schemes derive movement trajectories for dummies.

Performance evaluation of an optimal cache replacement policy for wireless data dissemination,Jianliang Xu; Qinglong Hu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Data caching at mobile clients is an important technique for improving the performance ofwireless data dissemination systems. However; variable data sizes; data updates; limitedclient resources; and frequent client disconnections make cache management a challenge.We propose a gain-based cache replacement policy; Min-SAUD; for wireless datadissemination when cache consistency must be enforced before a cached item is used. Min-SAUD considers several factors that affect cache performance; namely; access probability;update frequency; data size; retrieval delay; and cache validation cost. The paper employsstretch as the major performance metric since it accounts for the data service time and; thus;is fair when items have different sizes. We prove that Min-SAUD achieves optimal stretchunder some standard assumptions. Moreover; a series of simulation experiments have …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,134
QFilter: fine-grained run-time XML access control via NFA-based query rewriting,Bo Luo; Dongwon Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Peng Liu,Abstract At present; most of the state-of-the-art solutions for XML access controls are either(1) document-level access control techniques that are too limited to support fine-grainedsecurity enforcement;(2) view-based approaches that are often expensive to create andmaintain; or (3) impractical proposals that require substantial security-related support fromunderlying XML databases. In this paper; we take a different approach that assumes nosecurity support from underlying XML databases and examine three alternative fine-grainedXML access control solutions; namely< i> primitive; pre-processing</i> and< i> post-processing</i> approaches. In particular; we advocate a pre-processing method called< i>QFilter</i> that uses Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to rewrite user's query suchthat any parts violating access control rules are pruned.

CLR: a collaborative location recommendation framework based on co-clustering,Kenneth Wai-Ting Leung; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract GPS data tracked on mobile devices contains rich information about humanactivities and preferences. In this paper; GPS data is used in location-based services (LBSs)to provide collaborative location recommendations. We observe that most existing LBSsprovide location recommendations by clustering the User-Location matrix. Since the User-Location matrix created based on GPS data is huge; there are two major problems withthese methods. First; the number of similar locations that need to be considered incomputing the recommendations can be numerous. As a result; the identification of trulyrelevant locations from numerous candidates is challenging. Second; the clustering processon large matrix is time consuming. Thus; when new GPS data arrives; complete re-clusteringof the whole matrix is infeasible.

Grid-partition index: a hybrid method for nearest-neighbor queries in wireless location-based services,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Traditional nearest-neighbor (NN) search is based on two basic indexingapproaches: object-based indexing and solution-based indexing. The former is constructedbased on the locations of data objects: using some distance heuristics on object locations.The latter is built on a precomputed solution space. Thus; NN queries can be reduced to andprocessed as simple point queries in this solution space. Both approaches exhibit somedisadvantages; especially when employed for wireless data broadcast in mobile computingenvironments. In this paper; we introduce a new index method; called the grid-partitionindex; to support NN search in both on-demand access and periodic broadcast modes ofmobile computing. The grid-partition index is constructed based on the Voronoi diagram; ie;the solution space of NN queries. However; it has two distinctive characteristics. First; it …,The VLDB Journal,2006,115

Due to the important role locationinformation plays in mobile search; we separate concepts into content concepts and locationconcepts; and organize them into ontologies to create an ontology-based; multi-facet (OMF)profile to precisely capture the user's content and location interests and hence improve thesearch accuracy.

To improve the efficiencyof energy consumption on mobile devices; traditional disk-based indexing techniques suchas B $^+ $-tree have been extended to index broadcast data on a wireless channel.However; existing designs are mostly based on centralized tree structures. Most of theseindexing techniques are not flexible in the sense that the trade-off between access efficiencyand energy conservation is not adjustable based on application specific requirements.

What you are is when you are: the temporal dimension of feature types in location-based social networks,Mao Ye; Krzysztof Janowicz; Christoph Mülligann; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Feature types play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing geographicinformation. Usually; these types are defined; standardized; and controlled by domainexperts and cover geographic features on the mesoscale level; eg; populated places;forests; or lakes. While feature types also underlie most Location-Based Services (LBS);assigning a consistent typing schema for Points Of Interest (POI) across different data sets ischallenging. In case of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI); types are assigned astags by a heterogeneous community with different backgrounds and applications in mind.Consequently; VGI research is shifting away from data completeness and positionalaccuracy as quality measures towards attribute accuracy.

DSI: A fully distributed spatial index for location-based wireless broadcast services,Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng,Recent announcement of the MSN Direct Service has demonstrated the feasibility andindustrial interest in utilizing wireless broadcast for pervasive information services. Tosupport location-based services in wireless data broadcast systems; a distributed spatialindex (called DSI) is proposed in this paper. DSI is highly efficient because it has a linear yetfully distributed structure that facilitates multiple search paths to be naturally mixed togetherby sharing links. Moreover; DSI is very resilient in error-prone wireless communicationenvironments. Search algorithms for two classical location-based queries; window queriesand kNN queries; based on DSI are presented.

Performance evaluation of a wireless hierarchical data dissemination system,Qinglong Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Various techniques have been developed to improve the performance of wirelessinformation services. Techniques such as information broadcasting; caching of frequentlyaccessed data; and point-to-point channels for pull-based data requests are often used toreduce data access time. To efficiently utilize information broadcast; indexing andscheduling schemes are employed for the organization of data broadcast. Most of thestudies in the literature focused either on individual technique or a combination of them withsome restrictive assumptions. There is no study considering these techniques workingtogether in an integrated manner. In this paper; we propose a dynamic data delivery modelfor wireless communication environments. An important feature of our model is that data aredisseminated through various storage mediums according to the dynamically collected …,Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM/IEEE international conference on Mobile computing and networking,1999,81

Location recommendation for out-of-town users in location-based social networks,Gregory Ference; Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Most previous research on location recommendation services in location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) makes recommendations without considering where the targeteduser is currently located. Such services may recommend a place near her hometown even ifthe user is traveling out of town. In this paper; we study the issues in making locationrecommendations for out-of-town users by taking into account user preference; socialinfluence and geographical proximity. Accordingly; we propose a collaborativerecommendation framework; called User Preference; Proximity and Social-BasedCollaborative Filtering}(UPS-CF); to make location recommendation for mobile users inLBSNs. We validate our ideas by comprehensive experiments using real datasets collectedfrom Foursquare and Gowalla. By comparing baseline algorithms and conventional …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,77
Exploring spatial correlation for link quality estimation in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; W-C Lee,The irregularity in quality of wireless communication links poses significant researchchallenges in wireless sensor network design. Dynamic network conditions andenvironmental factors make an online; self-adapted link quality estimation mechanism withinsensor nodes a necessity for making routing decisions and improving network performance.In this paper; we present a weighted regression algorithm for efficient and accurateestimation of link quality in wireless sensor networks. This algorithm captures the spatialcorrelation in quality of links between a sensor node and its neighbor nodes; such that thequality of a link to a neighbor node can be estimated based on the quality of links to othernodes geographically close. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using a trace-basedsimulator which takes into account the variances of link quality over time and spatial …,Pervasive Computing and Communications; 2006.

App recommendation: a contest between satisfaction and temptation,Peifeng Yin; Ping Luo; Wang-Chien Lee; Min Wang,Abstract Due to the huge and still rapidly growing number of mobile applications (apps); itbecomes necessary to provide users an app recommendation service. Different fromconventional item recommendation where the user interest is the primary factor; apprecommendation also needs to consider factors that invoke a user to replace an old app (ifshe already has one) with a new app. In this work we propose an Actual-Tempting modelthat captures such factors in the decision process of mobile app adoption. The modelassumes that each owned app has an actual satisfactory value and a new app underconsideration has a tempting value. The former stands for the real satisfactory value theowned app brings to the user while the latter represents the estimated value the new appmay seemingly have. We argue that the process of app adoption therefore is a contest …,Proceedings of the sixth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2013,76
PSGR: priority-based stateless geo-routing in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Jianliang Xu; Gail Mitchell,Volunteer forwarding; as an emerging routing idea for large scale; location-aware wirelesssensor networks; recently has attracted a significant amount of research attention. However;several critical research issues raised by volunteer forwarding; including priority assignment;acknowledgement collisions and communication voids; have not been well addressed bythe existing work. In this paper; we propose a priority-based stateless geo-routing (PSGR)protocol to address these issues. Based on PSGR; sensor nodes are able to locallydetermine their priority to serve as the next relay node using dynamically estimated networkdensity. This effectively suppresses potential communication collisions without prolongingrouting delays. PSGR also overcomes the communication void problem using twoalternative stateless schemes; rebroadcast and bypass. We analyze energy consumption …,Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems Conference; 2005.

Proactive caching for spatial queries in mobile environments,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Wing Sing Wong; Baihua Zheng; Dik Lun Lee; W-C Lee,Semantic caching enables mobile clients to answer spatial queries locally by storing thequery descriptions together with the results. However; it supports only a limited number ofquery types; and sharing results among these types is difficult. To address these issues; wepropose a proactive caching model which caches the result objects as well as the index thatsupports these objects as the results. The cached index enables the objects to be reused forall common types of queries. We also propose an adaptive scheme to cache such an index;which further optimizes the query response time for the best user experience. Simulationresults show that proactive caching achieves a significant performance gain over pagecaching and semantic caching in mobile environments where wireless bandwidth andbattery are precious resources.,Data Engineering; 2005.

A novel caching scheme for internet based mobile ad hoc networks,Sunho Lim; W-C Lee; Guohong Cao; Chita R Das,Internet based mobile ad hoc network (IMANET) is an emerging technique that combines awired network (eg Internet) and a mobile ad hoc network (manet) for developing aubiquitous communication infrastructure. However; imanet has several limitations to fulfillusers' demands to access various kinds of information such as limited accessibility to thewired Internet; insufficient wireless bandwidth; and longer message latency. In this paper;we address the issues involved in information search and access in IMANET. A broadcastbased simple search (SS) algorithm and an aggregate caching mechanism are proposed forimproving the information accessibility and reducing average communication latency inimanet. As part of the aggregate cache; a cache admission control policy and a cachereplacement policy; called time and distance sensitive (TDS) replacement; are developed …,Computer Communications and Networks; 2003.

The D-tree: An index structure for planar point queries in location-based wireless services,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Location-based services (LBSs); considered as a killer application in the wireless datamarket; provide information based on locations specified in the queries. In this paper; weexamine the indexing issue for querying location-dependent data in wireless LBSs; inparticular; we focus on an important class of queries; planar point queries. To address theissues of responsiveness; energy consumption; and bandwidth contention in wirelesscommunications; an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storageoverhead. It is shown that the traditional point-location algorithms and spatial indexstructures fail to achieve either objective or both. This paper proposes a new index structure;called D-tree; which indexes spatial regions based on the divisions that form the boundariesof the regions. We describe how to construct a binary D-tree index; how to process …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,71
An error-resilient and tunable distributed indexing scheme for wireless data broadcast,Jianliang Xu; W-C Lee; Xueyan Tang; Qing Gao; Shanping Li,Access efficiency and energy conservation are two critical performance concerns in awireless data broadcast system. We propose in this paper a novel parameterized indexcalled the exponential index that has a linear yet distributed structure for wireless databroadcast. Based on two tuning knobs; index base and chunk size; the exponential indexcan be tuned to optimize the access latency with the tuning time bounded by a given limit;and vice versa. The client access algorithm for the exponential index under unreliablebroadcast is described. A performance analysis of the exponential index is provided.Extensive ns-2-based simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performanceunder various link error probabilities.

SAIU: An efficient cache replacement policy for wireless on-demand broadcasts,Jianliang Xu; Qinglong Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,ABSTRACT In a wireless communication environment; on-demand broadcasting is anattractive information delivery method; while data caching is an important technique used toimprove system performance. However; most of the wireless data caching techniques in theliterature were designed for pushbased broadcast systems. Due to variable item sizes; dataupdates and frequent client disconnections; the design of client cache management in an on-demand broadcast system becomes a challenge. In this paper; we propose an efficient gain-based cache replacement policy; SAIU; for on-demand broadcasts. In SAIU; the influence ofdata size; data retrieval delay; access probability and update frequency is consideredtogether. Simulation-based performance evaluation shows that the proposed policysubstantially outperforms the existing strategies. 1.

Indexing techniques for wireless data broadcast under data clustering and scheduling,Quinglong Hu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract This paper investigates power conserving indexing techniques for datadisseminated on a broadcast channel. A hybrid indexing method combining strengths of thesignature and the index tree techniques is presented. Different from previous studies; ourresearch takes into consideration two important data organization factors; namely; clusteringand scheduling. Cost models for index; signature and hybrid methods are derived by takinginto account various data organizations accommodating these two factors. Based on ouranalytical comparisons; the signature and the hybrid indexing techniques are the bestchoices for power conserving indexing of various data organizations on wireless broadcastchannels.,Proceedings of the eighth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1999,66
Signature file methods for indexing object-oriented database systems,Wang-chien Lee; Dik L Lee,Abstract Although object-oriented database systems offer more powerful modeling capabilitythan relational database systems; their performance suffers from the increased complexity inthe data model. Thus; efficient index mechanisms must be used to improve the performance.In this paper; two new signature methods for indexing objectoriented databases and theassociated operations are described. The cost models for the analysis of storage overheadand performance of the methods are presented.,Proc. ICIC,1992,66
A distributed spatial index for error-prone wireless data broadcast,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Ken CK Lee; Dik Lun Lee; Min Shao,Abstract Information is valuable to users when it is available not only at the right time butalso at the right place. To support efficient location-based data access in wireless databroadcast systems; a distributed spatial index (called DSI) is presented in this paper. DSI ishighly efficient because it has a linear yet fully distributed structure that naturally shares linksin different search paths. DSI is very resilient to the error-prone wireless communicationenvironment because interrupted search operations based on DSI can be resumed easily. Itsupports search algorithms for classical location-based queries such as window queries andk NN queries in both of the snapshot and continuous query modes. In-depth analysis andsimulation-based evaluation have been conducted. The results show that DSI significantlyout-performs a variant of R-trees tailored for wireless data broadcast environments.,The VLDB Journal,2009,64
Data broadcast,Jianliang Xu; Dik-Lin Lee; Qinglong Hu; Wang-Chien Lee,We have been witnessing in the past few years the rapid growth of wireless dataapplications in the commercial market thanks to the advent of wireless devices; wirelesshighspeed networks; and supporting software technologies. We envisage that in the nearfuture; a large number of mobile users carrying portable devices (eg; palmtops; laptops;PDAs; WAP phones; etc.) will be able to access a variety of information from anywhere andat any time. The types of information that may become accessible wirelessly are boundlessand include news; stock quotes; airline schedules; and weather and traffic information; toname but a few. There are two fundamental information delivery methods for wireless dataapplications: point-to-point access and broadcast.

Mining geographic-temporal-semantic patterns in trajectories for location prediction,Josh Jia-Ching Ying; Wang-Chien Lee; Vincent S Tseng,Abstract In recent years; research on location predictions by mining trajectories of users hasattracted a lot of attention. Existing studies on this topic mostly treat such predictions as just atype of location recommendation; that is; they predict the next location of a user usinglocation recommenders. However; an user usually visits somewhere for reasons other thaninterestingness. In this article; we propose a novel mining-based location predictionapproach called Geographic-Temporal-Semantic-based Location Prediction (GTS-LP);which takes into account a user's geographic-triggered intentions; temporal-triggeredintentions; and semantic-triggered intentions; to estimate the probability of the user in visitinga location. The core idea underlying our proposal is the discovery of trajectory patterns ofusers; namely GTS patterns; to capture frequent movements triggered by the three kinds …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2013,58
DPTree: A balanced tree based indexing framework for peer-to-peer systems,Mei Li; Wang-chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam,Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have been widely used for exchange of voluminous informationand resources among thousands or even millions of users. Since shared data are normallyidentified by multiple attributes; a fundamental issue in P2P systems is to efficiently supportcomplex queries on multidimensional data. Prior works suffer from some fundamentallimitations; such as being constrained to support certain types of queries; excessivemaintenance overheads; and etc. In this study; we propose a framework; called distributedpeer tree (DPTree); which efficiently supports various types of queries on multidimensionaldata in P2P systems based on balanced tree indexes. DPTree achieves the efficiencythrough the following designs: 1) distributing the tree structure among peers in a waypreserving the nice properties of balanced tree structures yet avoiding single points of …,Network Protocols; 2006.

Performance comparison of cache invalidation strategies for Internet-based mobile ad hoc networks,Sunho Lim; Wang-Chien Lee; Guohong Cao; Chita R Das,Internet-based mobile ad hoc network (IMANET) combines a mobile ad hoc network(MANET) and the Internet to provide universal information accessibility. Although cachingfrequently accessed data items in mobile terminals (MTs) improves the communicationperformance in an IMANET; it brings a critical design issue when data items are updated.We analyze several push and pull-based cache invalidation strategies for IMANETS. Aglobal positioning system (GPS) based connectivity estimation (GPSCE) scheme is firstproposed to assess the connectivity of an MT for supporting any cache invalidationmechanism. Then; we propose a pull-based approach; called aggregate cache based ondemand (ACOD) scheme; to find the queried data items efficiently. In addition; we modify twopush-based cache invalidation strategies; proposed for cellular networks; to work in …,Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems; 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,58
Nearest surrounder queries,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong,In this paper; we present a new type of spatial queries called Nearest Surrounder (NS)queries. An NS query determines the nearest polygon-shaped spatial objects (referred to asnearest surrounder objects) and their orientations with respect to a query point from anobject set. Besides; we derive two NS query variants; namely; multitier NS (m-NS) queriesand angle-constrained NS (ANS) queries. An m-NS query searches multiple layers of NSobjects for the same range of angles from a query point. An ANS query searches for NSobjects within a specified range of angles. To evaluate NS queries and their variants; weexplore angle-based and distance-based bound properties of polygons; and devise twoefficient algorithms; namely; Sweep and Ripple; based on R-tree. The algorithms accessobjects in an order according to their orientations and distances with respect to a given …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2010,57
Visible reverse k-nearest neighbor query processing in spatial databases,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Gencai Chen; Wang-Chien Lee; Ken CK Lee; Qing Li,Reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries have a broad application base such as decisionsupport; profile-based marketing; resource allocation; etc. Previous work on RNN searchdoes not take obstacles into consideration. In the real world; however; there are manyphysical obstacles (eg; buildings) and their presence may affect the visibility betweenobjects. In this paper; we introduce a novel variant of RNN queries; namely; visible reversenearest neighbor (VRNN) search; which considers the impact of obstacles on the visibility ofobjects. Given a data set P; an obstacle set O; and a query point q in a 2D space; a VRNNquery retrieves the points in P that have q as their visible nearest neighbor. We propose anefficient algorithm for VRNN query processing; assuming that P and O are indexed by R-trees.

Z-SKY: an efficient skyline query processing framework based on Z-order,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Huajing Li; Yuan Tian,Abstract Given a set of data points in a multidimensional space; a skyline query retrievesthose data points that are not dominated by any other point in the same dataset. Observingthat the properties of Z-order space filling curves (or Z-order curves) perfectly match with thedominance relationships among data points in a geometrical data space; we; in this paper;develop and present a novel and efficient processing framework to evaluate skyline queriesand their variants; and to support skyline result updates based on Z-order curves. Thisframework consists of ZBtree; ie; an index structure to organize a source dataset and skylinecandidates; and a suite of algorithms; namely;(1) ZSearch; which processes skylinequeries;(2) ZInsert; ZDelete and ZUpdate; which incrementally maintain skyline results inpresence of source dataset updates;(3) ZBand; which answers skyband queries;(4) …,The VLDB Journal,2010,56
A new storage scheme for approximate location queries in object-tracking sensor networks,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Wang-Chien Lee,Energy efficiency is one of the most critical issues in the design of wireless sensor networks.Observing that many sensor applications for object tracking can tolerate a certain degree ofimprecision in the location data of tracked objects; this paper studies precision-constrainedapproximate queries that trade answer precision for energy efficiency. We develop anenergy-conserving approximate storage (EASE) scheme to efficiently answer approximatelocation queries by keeping error-bounded imprecise location data at some designatedstorage node. The data impreciseness is captured by a system parameter called theapproximation radius. We derive the optimal setting of the approximation radius for ourstorage scheme based on the mobility pattern and devise an adaptive algorithm to adjust thesetting when the mobility pattern is not available a priori or is dynamically changing …,IEEE transactions on parallel and distributed systems,2008,56
Clustering and aggregating clues of trajectories for mining trajectory patterns and routes,Chih-Chieh Hung; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new trajectory pattern mining framework; namelyClustering and Aggregating Clues of Trajectories (CACT); for discovering trajectory routesthat represent the frequent movement behaviors of a user. In addition to spatial and temporalbiases; we observe that trajectories contain silent durations; ie; the time durations when nodata points are available to describe the movements of users; which bring many challengingissues to trajectory pattern mining. We claim that a movement behavior would leave someclues in its various sampled/observed trajectories. These clues may be extracted fromspatially and temporally co-located data points from the observed trajectories. Based on thisobservation; we propose clue-aware trajectory similarity to measure the clues between twotrajectories. Accordingly; we further propose the clue-aware trajectory clustering algorithm …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2015,55
Pmse: A personalized mobile search engine,Kenneth Wai-Ting Leung; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,We propose a personalized mobile search engine (PMSE) that captures the users'preferences in the form of concepts by mining their clickthrough data. Due to the importanceof location information in mobile search; PMSE classifies these concepts into contentconcepts and location concepts. In addition; users' locations (positioned by GPS) are used tosupplement the location concepts in PMSE. The user preferences are organized in anontology-based; multifacet user profile; which are used to adapt a personalized rankingfunction for rank adaptation of future search results. To characterize the diversity of theconcepts associated with a query and their relevances to the user's need; four entropies areintroduced to balance the weights between the content and location facets.

Ssw: A small-world-based overlay for peer-to-peer search,Mei Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam; Jing Zhao,Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have become a popular platform for sharing and exchangingvoluminous information among thousands or even millions of users. The massive amount ofinformation shared in such systems mandates efficient semantic-based search instead ofkey-based search. The majority of existing proposals can only support simple key-basedsearch rather than semantic-based search. This paper presents the design of an overlaynetwork; namely; semantic small world (SSW); that facilitates efficient semantic-basedsearch in P2P systems. SSW achieves the efficiency based on four ideas: 1) semanticclustering; where peers with similar semantics organize into peer clusters; 2) dimensionreduction; where to address the high maintenance overhead associated with capturing high-dimensional data semantics in the overlay; peer clusters are adaptively mapped to a one …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2008,55
ROAD: A new spatial object search framework for road networks,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Yuan Tian,In this paper; we present a new system framework called ROAD for spatial object search onroad networks. ROAD is extensible to diverse object types and efficient for processingvarious location-dependent spatial queries (LDSQs); as it maintains objects separately froma given network and adopts an effective search space pruning technique. Based on ouranalysis on the two essential operations for LDSQ processing; namely; network traversaland object lookup; ROAD organizes a large road network as a hierarchy of interconnectedregional subnetworks (called Rnets). Each Rnet is augmented with 1) shortcuts and 2)object abstracts to accelerate network traversals and provide quick object lookups;respectively. To manage those shortcuts and object abstracts; two cooperating indices;namely; Route Overlay and Association Directory are devised.

Scalable community discovery on textual data with relations,Huajing Li; Zaiqing Nie; Wang-Chien Lee; Lee Giles; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Every piece of textual data is generated as a method to convey its authors' opinionregarding specific topics. Authors deliberately organize their writings and create links; ie;references; acknowledgments; for better expression. Thereafter; it is of interest to study textsas well as their relations to understand the underlying topics and communities. Althoughmany efforts exist in the literature in data clustering and topic mining; they are not applicableto community discovery on large document corpus for several reasons. First; few of themconsider both textual attributes as well as relations. Second; scalability remains a significantissue for large-scale datasets. Additionally; most algorithms rely on a set of initial parametersthat are hard to be captured and tuned. Motivated by the aforementioned observations; ahierarchical community model is proposed in the paper which distinguishes community …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,54

Parallelizing itinerary-based KNN query processing in wireless sensor networks,Tao-Yang Fu; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Wireless sensor networks have been proposed for facilitating various monitoringapplications (eg; environmental monitoring and military surveillance) over a widegeographical region. In these applications; spatial queries that collect data from wirelesssensor networks play an important role. One such query is the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)query that facilitates collection of sensor data samples based on a given query location andthe number of samples specified (ie; K). Recently; itinerary-based KNN query processingtechniques; which propagate queries and collect data along a predetermined itinerary; havebeen developed. Prior studies demonstrate that itinerary-based KNN query processingalgorithms are able to achieve better energy efficiency than other existing algorithmsdeveloped upon tree-based network infrastructures.

On socio-spatial group query for location-based social networks,De-Nian Yang; Chih-Ya Shen; Wang-Chien Lee; Ming-Syan Chen,Abstract Challenges faced in organizing impromptu activities are the requirements of makingtimely invitations in accordance with the locations of candidate attendees and the socialrelationship among them. It is desirable to find a group of attendees close to a rally point andensure that the selected attendees have a good social relationship to create a goodatmosphere in the activity. Therefore; this paper proposes Socio-Spatial Group Query(SSGQ) to select a group of nearby attendees with tight social relation. Efficient processingof SSGQ is very challenging due to the tradeoff in the spatial and social domains. We showthat the problem is NP-hard via a proof and design an efficient algorithm SSGSelect; whichincludes effective pruning techniques to reduce the running time for finding the optimalsolution.

Analyzing the spatial-semantic interaction of points of interest in volunteered geographic information,Christoph Mülligann; Krzysztof Janowicz; Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract With the increasing success and commercial integration of Volunteered GeographicInformation (VGI); the focus shifts away from coverage to data quality and homogeneity.Within the last years; several studies have been published analyzing the positional accuracyof features; completeness of specific attributes; or the topological consistency of line andpolygon features. However; most of these studies do not take geographic feature types intoaccount. This is for two reasons. First; and in contrast to street networks; choosing areference set is difficult. Second; we lack the measures to quantify the degree of feature typemis-categorization. In this work; we present a methodology to analyze the spatial-semanticinteraction of point features in Volunteered Geographic Information.

Continuous visible nearest neighbor queries,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Gencai Chen,Abstract In this paper; we identify and solve a new type of spatial queries; called continuousvisible nearest neighbor (CVNN) search. Given a data set P; an obstacle set O; and a queryline segment q; a CVNN query returns a set of (p; R) tuples such that p ε P is the nearestneighbor (NN) to every point r along the interval R ε q as well as p is visible to r. Note that pmay be NULL; meaning that all points in P are invisible to all points in R; due to theobstruction of some obstacles in O. In this paper; we formulate the problem and proposeefficient algorithms for CVNN query processing; assuming that both P and O are indexed byR-trees. In addition; we extend our techniques to several variations of the CVNN query.Extensive experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithmsusing both real and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,48

Thischapter discusses low-level preprocessing of trajectories. First; it discusses how to reducethe size of data required to store a trajectory; in order to save storage costs and reduceredundant data. The data reduction techniques can run in a batch mode after the data iscollected or in an on-line mode as the data is collected. Part of this discussion consists ofmethods to measure the error introduced by the data reduction techniques. The second partof the chapter discusses methods for filtering spatial trajectories to reduce measurementnoise and to estimate higher level properties of a trajectory like its speed and direction. Themethods include mean and median filtering; the Kalman filter; and the particle filter.,*,2011,47

Consistent query answering under key and exclusion dependencies: Algorithms and experiments,Luca Grieco; Domenico Lembo; Riccardo Rosati; Marco Ruzzi,Abstract Research in consistent query answering studies the definition and computation of"meaningful" answers to queries posed to inconsistent databases; ie; databases whose datado not satisfy the integrity constraints (ICs) declared on their schema. Computing consistentanswers to conjunctive queries is generally coNP-hard in data complexity; even in thepresence of very restricted forms of ICs (single; unary keys). Recent studies on consistentquery answering for database schemas containing only key dependencies have analyzedthe possibility of identifying classes of queries whose consistent answers can be obtained bya first-order rewriting of the query; which in turn can be easily formulated in SQL and directlyevaluated through any relational DBMS.

Location-dependent skyline query,Baihua Zheng; Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Given a set of data points with both spatial coordinates andnon-spatial attributes; point alocation-dependently dominates point b with respect to a query point q if a is closer to q thanb and meanwhile a dominates b. A location-dependent skyline query (LDSQ) issued at pointq is to retrieve all the points that are not location-dependently dominated by other points withregard to q. In this paper; we focus on the query processing and result validation of LDSQoverstatic objects. Two algorithms; namely brute-forth and δ-scanning; are proposed. Theformer serves as the baseline algorithm while the latter significantly improves theperformance via space pruning. We further conduct a comprehensive simulation todemonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms.,Mobile Data Management; 2008. MDM'08. 9th International Conference on,2008,46
Analysis of TTL-based consistency in unstructured peer-to-peer networks,Xueyan Tang; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Consistency maintenance is important to the sharing of dynamic contents in peer-to-peer(P2P) networks. The TTL-based mechanism is a natural choice for maintaining freshness inP2P content sharing. This paper investigates TTL-based consistency maintenance inunstructured P2P networks. In this approach; each replica is assigned an expiration timebeyond which the replica stops serving new requests unless it is validated. While TTL-basedconsistency is widely explored in many client-server applications; there has been no studyon TTL-based consistency in P2P networks. Our main contribution is an analytical modelthat studies the search performance and the freshness of P2P content sharing under TTL-based consistency. Due to the random nature of request routing; P2P networks arefundamentally different from most existing TTL-based systems in that every node with a …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2008,43
Ranked reverse nearest neighbor search,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Given a set of data points P and a query point q in a multidimensional space; reversenearest neighbor (RNN) query finds data points in P whose nearest neighbors are q.Reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) query (where k ges 1) generalizes RNN query to finddata points whose kNNs include q. For RkNN query semantics; q is said to have influence toall those answer data points. The degree of q's influence on a data point p (isin P) is denotedby kappap where q is the kappap-th NN of p. We introduce a new variant of RNN query;namely; ranked reverse nearest neighbor (RRNN) query; that retrieves t data points mostinfluenced by q; ie; the t data points having the smallest kappa's with respect to q. To answerthis RRNN query efficiently; we propose two novel algorithms; kappa-counting and kappa-browsing that are applicable to both monochromatic and bichromatic scenarios and are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,43
On searching continuous k nearest neighbors in wireless data broadcast systems,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,A continuous nearest neighbor (CNN) search; which retrieves the nearest neighborscorresponding to every point in a given query line segment; is important for location-basedservices such as vehicular navigation and tourist guides. It is infeasible to answer a CNNsearch by issuing a traditional nearest neighbor query at every point of the line segment dueto the large number of queries generated and the overhead on bandwidth. Algorithms havebeen proposed recently to support CNN search in the traditional client-server systems butnot in the environment of wireless data broadcast; where uplink communication channelsfrom mobile devices to the server are not available. In this paper; we develop a generalizedsearch algorithm for continuous k-nearest neighbors based on Hilbert Curve Index inwireless data broadcast systems. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2007,43
Processing k nearest neighbor queries in location-aware sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Tao-Yang Fu; Wang-Chien Lee; Julian Winter,Abstract Efficient search for k nearest neighbors to a given location point (called a KNNquery) is an important problem arising in a variety of sensor network applications. In thispaper; we investigate in-network query processing strategies under a KNN query processingframework in location-aware wireless sensor networks. A set of algorithms; namely the geo-routing tree; the KNN boundary tree and the itinerary-based KNN algorithms; are designedin accordance with the global infrastructure-based; local infrastructure-based andinfrastructure-free strategies; respectively. They have distinctive performance characteristicsand are desirable under different contexts. We evaluate the performance of these algorithmsunder several sensor network scenarios and application requirements; and identify theconditions under which the various approaches are preferable.,Signal Processing,2007,41
In-broker access control: Towards efficient end-to-end performance of information brokerage systems,Fenjun Li; Bo Luo; Peng Liu; Dongwon Lee; Prasenjit Mitra; W-C Lee; Chao-Hsien Chu,An XML brokerage system is a distributed XML database system that comprises datasources and brokers which; respectively; hold XML documents and document distributioninformation. However; all existing information brokerage systems view or handle querybrokering and access control as two orthogonal issues: query brokering is a system issuethat concerns costs and performance; while access control is a security issue that concernsinformation confidentiality. As a result; access control deployment strategies (in terms ofwhere and when to do access control) and the impact of such strategies on end-to-endsystem performance are neglected by existing information brokerage systems. In addition;data source side access control deployment is taken-for-granted as the" right" thing to do. Inthis paper; we challenge this traditional; taken-for-granted access control deployment …,Sensor Networks; Ubiquitous; and Trustworthy Computing; 2006. IEEE International Conference on,2006,41
Energy efficient processing of k nearest neighbor queries in location-aware sensor networks,Julian Winter; Yingqi Xu; W-C Lee,The k nearest neighbor (KNN) query; an essential query for information processing in sensornetworks; has not received sufficient attention in the research community of sensor networks.In this paper; we examine in-network processing of KNN queries by proposing twoalternative algorithms; namely the GeoRouting Tree (GRT) and the KNN Boundary Tree(KBT). The former is based on a distributed spatial index structure and prunes off theirrelevant nodes during query propagation. The latter is based upon ad-hoc geographicrouting and first obtains a region within which at least k nearest sensor nodes are enclosedand then decides the k nearest nodes to the query point. We provide an extensiveperformance evaluation to study the impact of various system factors and protocolparameters.

On semantic caching and query scheduling for mobile nearest-neighbor search,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Location-based services have received increasing attention in recent years. In thispaper; we address the performance issues of mobile nearest-neighbor search; in which themobile user issues a query to retrieve stationary service objects nearest to him/her. An indexbased on Voronoi Diagram is used in the server to support such a search; while a semanticcache is proposed to enhance the access efficiency of the service. Cache replacementpolicies tailored for the proposed semantic cache are examined. Moreover; several queryscheduling policies are proposed to address the inter-cell roaming issues in multi-cellenvironments. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. The resultshows that the system performance; in terms of cache hit ratio; query response time; cell-cross number and cell-recross number; is improved significantly.,Wireless Networks,2004,41
Dynamic data delivery in wireless communication environments,Qinglong Hu; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Information broadcasting; caching of frequently accessed data; and pull-based datadelivery are commonly used techniques to reduce data access time of wireless informationservices. Most of the studies in the literature focused either on individual technique or acombination of them with some restrictive assumptions. In this paper; we propose a dynamicdata delivery model where these three techniques work together in an integrated manner. Aparticular feature of our model is that data are disseminated through various storagemediums according to the dynamically collected data access patterns. Performanceevaluation of the model is conducted by simulation studies.,*,1999,41

Spatial Index on Air.,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract With the advent of wireless networking and personal digital devices; the populationof mobile users will increase significantly. Broadcasting is particularly suitable forenvironments having a large number of clients. In this paper; we study the query processingof some typical location-dependent queries; such as window queries and kNN queries; in abroadcast system. To reduce clients' power consumption and provide efficient services; atransformation of the objects is applied based on Hilbert Curve. Furthermore; a linear indexstructure is constructed and several algorithms are devised to answer spatial queries.Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed transformation andrelated algorithms. Results show that the proposed schemes outperform existing algorithmssignificantly.,PerCom,2003,40
A straw shows which way the wind blows: ranking potentially popular items from early votes,Peifeng Yin; Ping Luo; Min Wang; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Prediction of popular items in online content sharing systems has recently attracteda lot of attention due to the tremendous need of users and its commercial values. Differentfrom previous works that make prediction by fitting a popularity growth model; we tackle thisproblem by exploiting the latent conforming and maverick personalities of those who vote toassess the quality of on-line items. We argue that the former personality prompts a user tocast her vote conforming to the majority of the service community while on the contrary thelater personality makes her vote different from the community. We thus propose a Conformer-Maverick (CM) model to simulate the voting process and use it to rank top-k potentiallypopular items based on the early votes they received. Through an extensive experimentalevaluation; we validate our ideas and find that our proposed CM model achieves better …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,39
Probabilistic top-k query processing in distributed sensor networks,Mao Ye; Xingjie Liu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,In this paper; we propose the notion of sufficient set for distributed processing of probabilisticTop-k queries in cluster-based wireless sensor networks. Through the derivation of sufficientboundary; we show that data items ranked lower than sufficient boundary are not requiredfor answering the probabilistic top-k queries; thus are subject to local pruning. Accordingly;we develop the sufficient set-based (SSB) algorithm for inter-cluster query processing.Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reduces data transmissionssignificantly.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,39
A probabilistic topic-based ranking framework for location-sensitive domain information retrieval,Huajing Li; Zhisheng Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract It has been observed that many queries submitted to search engines are location-sensitive. Traditional search techniques fail to interpret the significance of such geographicalclues and as such are unable to return highly relevant search results. Although there havebeen efforts in the literature to support location-aware information retrieval; criticalchallenges still remain in terms of search result quality and data scalability. In this paper; wepropose an innovative probabilistic ranking framework for domain information retrievalwhere users are interested in a set of location-sensitive topics. Our proposed methodrecognizes the geographical distribution of topic influence in the process of rankingdocuments and models it accurately using probabilistic Gaussian Process classifiers.Additionally; we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking framework by …,Proceedings of the 32nd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2009,39
Energy-conserving air indexes for nearest neighbor search,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract A location-based service (LBS) provides information based on the locationinformation specified in a query. Nearest-neighbor (NN) search is an important class ofqueries supported in LBSs. This paper studies energy-conserving air indexes for NN searchin a wireless broadcast environment. Linear access requirement of wireless broadcastweakens the performance of existing search algorithms designed for traditional spatialdatabase. In this paper; we propose a new energy-conserving index; called grid-partitionindex; which enables a single linear scan of the index for any NN queries. The idea is topartition the search space for NN queries into grid cells and index all the objects that arepotential nearest neighbors of a query point in each grid cell. Three grid partition schemesare proposed for the grid-partition index. Performance of the proposed grid-partition …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,39
CIM: Community-based influence maximization in social networks,Yi-Cheng Chen; Wen-Yuan Zhu; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee; Suh-Yin Lee,Abstract Given a social graph; the problem of influence maximization is to determine a set ofnodes that maximizes the spread of influences. While some recent research has studied theproblem of influence maximization; these works are generally too time consuming forpractical use in a large-scale social network. In this article; we develop a new framework;community-based influence maximization (CIM); to tackle the influence maximizationproblem with an emphasis on the time efficiency issue. Our proposed framework; CIM;comprises three phases:(i) community detection;(ii) candidate generation; and (iii) seedselection. Specifically; phase (i) discovers the community structure of the network; phase (ii)uses the information of communities to narrow down the possible seed candidates; andphase (iii) finalizes the seed nodes from the candidate set.

Communication motifs: a tool to characterize social communications,Qiankun Zhao; Yuan Tian; Qi He; Nuria Oliver; Ruoming Jin; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Social networks mediate not only the relations between entities; but also thepatterns of information propagation among them and their communication behavior. In thispaper; we extensively study the temporal annotations (eg; time stamps and duration) ofhistorical communications in social networks and propose two novel tools--communicationmotifs and maximum-flow communication motifs--for characterizations of the patterns ofinformation propagation in social networks. Using these motifs; we verify the followinghypothesis in social communication network: 1) the functional behavioral patterns ofinformation propagation within both social networks are stable over time; 2) the patterns ofinformation propagation in synchronous and asynchronous social networks are different andsensitive to the cost of communication; and 3) the speed and the amount of information …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,38

EASE: an energy-efficient in-network storage scheme for object tracking in sensor networks.,Jianliang Xu; Xueyan Tang; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract—Energy efficiency is one of the most critical issues in the design of wireless sensornetworks. Observing that many sensor applications for object tracking can tolerate a certaindegree of imprecision in location data of tracked objects; this paper studies precision-constrained approximate queries that trade answer precision for energy efficiency. Wedevelop an Energy-conserving Approximate StoragE (EASE) scheme to efficiently answerapproximate location queries by keeping errorbounded imprecise location data at somedesignated storage node. The data impreciseness is captured by a system parameter; ie;approximation radius. We analyze the performance of EASE in terms of message complexityand derive the optimal setting of approximation radius. We show via extensive simulationexperiments that; as compared to a conventional approach; the EASE scheme cuts down …,SECON,2005,38
Search continuous nearest neighbors on the air,Baihua Zheng; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,A continuous nearest neighbor (CNN) search retrieves the nearest neighbors correspondingto every point in a given query line segment. It is important for location-based services suchas vehicular navigation tools and tourist guides. It is infeasible to answer a CNN search byissuing a traditional nearest neighbor query at every point of the line segment due to thelarge number of queries generated and the large overhead on bandwidth. Algorithms havebeen proposed recently to support CNN search in the traditional client-server service model.In this paper; we conduct a pioneering study on CNN search in wireless data broadcastenvironments. We propose two air indexing techniques; namely; R-tree air index and Hilbertcurve air index; and develop algorithms based on these two techniques to search CNNs onthe air.

Path dictionary: a new access method for query processing in object-oriented databases,W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,We present a new access method; called the path dictionary index (PDI) method; forsupporting nested queries on object-oriented databases. PDI supports object traversal andassociative search; respectively; with a path dictionary and a set of attribute indexes built ontop of the path dictionary. We discuss issues on indexing and query processing in object-oriented databases; describe the operations of the new mechanism; develop cost models forits storage overhead and query and update costs; and compare the new mechanism to thepath index method. The result shows that the path dictionary index method is significantlybetter than the path index method over a wide range of parameters in terms of retrieval andupdate costs and that the storage overhead grows slowly with the number of indexedattributes.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1998,38
Efficient progressive processing of skyline queries in peer-to-peer systems,Huajing Li; Qingzhao Tan; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Skyline queries have received a lot of attention from database and informationretrieval research communities. A skyline query returns a set of data objects that is notdominated by any other data objects in a given dataset. However; most of existing studiesfocus on skyline query processing in centralized systems. Only recently; skyline queries areconsidered in a distributed computing environment. Acknowledging the trend toward peer-to-peer (P2P) systems in distributed computing; we examine the problem of skyline queryprocessing in P2P systems and propose innovative solutions. We exploit the data semanticembedded in semantically structured P2P overlay networks to efficiently prune searchspace; without compromising the quality of query result. In addition; we proposeapproximate algorithms to support skyline queries where exact answers are too costly to …,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Scalable information systems,2006,36
KPT: a dynamic KNN query processing algorithm for location-aware sensor networks,Julian Winter; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract An important type of spatial queries for sensor networks are K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) queries. Currently; research proposals for KNN query processing is based on indexstructures; which are typically expensive in terms of energy consumption. In addition; theyare vulnerable to node failure and are difficult to maintain in dynamic sensor networks. Inthis paper; we propose KPT; an algorithm for dynamically processing KNN queries inlocation-aware sensor networks. KPT shows great potential for energy savings andimproved query latency. Since the tree infrastructure is constructed only temporarily; KPT isless vulnerable to sensor node failure.,Proceeedings of the 1st international workshop on Data management for sensor networks: in conjunction with VLDB 2004,2004,36
A small world overlay network for semantic based search in P2P systems,Mei Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract. For a peer-to-peer (P2P) system holding massive amount of data; efficient searchfor resources (such as data or services) is a key determinant to its scalability. This paperpresents semantic small world (SSW); an overlay network and index structure for semanticbased P2P search. By dynamically clustering peer nodes in a semantic space based on thesemantics of their data and organizing the clusters into a small world network; SSWachieves a very competitive trade-off between the search latencies/traffic and maintenanceoverheads. Preliminary evaluation shows that SSW is much more scalable to very largenetwork sizes and very large numbers of data objects compared to pSearch; the stateof-the-art semantic-based search technique for P2P systems.,Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Semantics in Peer-to-Peer and Grid Computing; New York; USA,2004,36
Signature caching techniques for information filtering in mobile environments,Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract This paper discusses signature caching strategies to reduce power consumption forwireless broadcast and filtering services. The two-level signature scheme is used forindexing the information frames. A signature is considered as the basic caching entity in thispaper. Four caching policies are compared in terms of tune-in time and access time. Withreasonable access time delay; all of the caching policies reduce the tune-in time for the two-level signature scheme. Moreover; two cache replacement policies are presented andcompared by simulation. The result shows that; when the cache size is small; caching onlythe integrated signatures is recommended. When the size of cache is greater than that of theintegrated signatures; caching both of the integrated and simple signatures is better.,Wireless Networks,1999,36
U-skyline: A new skyline query for uncertain databases,Xingjie Liu; De-Nian Yang; Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee,The skyline query; aiming at identifying a set of skyline tuples that are not dominated by anyother tuple; is particularly useful for multicriteria data analysis and decision making. Foruncertain databases; a probabilistic skyline query; called P-Skyline; has been developed toreturn skyline tuples by specifying a probability threshold. However; the answer obtained viaa P-Skyline query usually includes skyline tuples undesirably dominating each other when asmall threshold is specified; or it may contain much fewer skyline tuples if a larger thresholdis employed. To address this concern; we propose a new uncertain skyline query; called U-Skyline query; in this paper. Instead of setting a probabilistic threshold to qualify eachskyline tuple independently; the U-Skyline query searches for a set of tuples that has thehighest probability (aggregated from all possible scenarios) as the skyline answer.

On mining moving patterns for object tracking sensor networks,Wen-Chih Peng; Yu-Zen Ko; Wang-Chien Lee,In this paper; we propose a heterogeneous tracking model; referred to as HTM; to efficientlymine object moving patterns and track objects. Specifically; we use a variable memoryMarkov model to exploit the dependencies among object movements. Furthermore; due tothe hierarchical nature of HTM; multi-resolution object moving patterns are provided. Theproposed HTM is able to accurately predict the movements of objects and thus reduces theenergy consumption for object tracking. Simulation results show that HTM not only is able toeffectively mine object moving patterns but also save energy in tracking objects.,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

Existing methods; however;assume that an object only moves along an anticipated path. In this paper; we study theproblem of answering probabilistic range queries on moving objects based on anuncertainty model; which captures the possible movements of objects with probabilities.Evaluation of probabilistic queries is challenging due to large objects volume and costlycomputation. We map the uncertain movements of all objects to a dual space for indexing.By querying the index; we quickly eliminate unqualified objects and employ an approximateapproach to examine the remaining candidates for final answer.

Energy-aware set-covering approaches for approximate data collection in wireless sensor networks,Chih-Chieh Hung; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,To conserve energy; sensor nodes with similar readings can be grouped such that readingsfrom only the representative nodes within the groups need to be reported. However;efficiently identifying sensor groups and their representative nodes is a very challengingtask. In this paper; we propose a centralized algorithm to determine a set of representativenodes with high energy levels and wide data coverage ranges. Here; the data coveragerange of a sensor node is considered to be the set of sensor nodes that have readingbehaviors very close to the particular sensor node. To further reduce the extra cost incurredin messages for selection of representative nodes; a distributed algorithm is developed.Furthermore; maintenance mechanisms are proposed to dynamically select alternativerepresentative nodes when the original representative nodes run low on energy; or …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,33
Cache invalidation strategies for internet-based mobile ad hoc networks,Sunho Lim; Wang-Chien Lee; Guohong Cao; Chita R Das,Abstract Internet-based mobile ad hoc network (Imanet) is an emerging technique thatcombines a mobile ad hoc network (Manet) and the Internet to provide universal informationaccessibility. Although caching frequently accessed data items in mobile terminals (MTs)improves the communication performance in an Imanet; it brings a critical design issue whendata updates. In this paper; we analyze several push and pull-based cache invalidationstrategies for Imanets. A global positioning system (GPS) based connectivity estimation(GPSCE) scheme is first proposed to assess the connectivity of an MT for supporting cacheinvalidation mechanisms. Then; we propose a pull-based approach; called aggregate cachebased on demand (ACOD) scheme that uses an efficient search algorithm for finding thequeried data items. In addition; we modify two push-based cache invalidation strategies …,Computer Communications,2007,33
A cross pruning framework for top-k data collection in wireless sensor networks,Xingjie Liu; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Energy conservation is a key issue for algorithm designs in wireless sensor networks. In thispaper; we explore in-network aggregation techniques for answering top-k queries inwireless sensor networks. A top-k query retrieves the k data objects with the highest scoresevaluated by a scoring function on interested features of sensor readings. Our study showsthat existing techniques for processing top-k query; eg; Tiny AGgregation Service (TAG); arenot energy efficient due to deficiencies in their routing structures and data aggregationmechanisms. To address these deficiencies; we propose to develop a new cross pruning(XP) aggregation framework for top-k data collection in wireless sensor networks.

Visible reverse k-nearest neighbor queries,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Gencai Chen; Wang-Chien Lee; Ken CK Lee; Qing Li,Reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries have a broad application base such as decisionsupport; profile-based marketing; resource allocation; data mining; etc. Previous work onRNN search does not take obstacles into consideration. In the real world; however; there aremany physical obstacles (eg; buildings; blindages; etc.); and their presence may affect thevisibility/distance between two objects. In this paper; we introduce a novel variant of RNNqueries; namely visible reverse nearest neighbor (VRNN) search; which considers theobstacle influence on the visibility of objects. Given a data set P; an obstacle set O; and aquery point q; a VRNN query retrieves the points in P that have q as their nearest neighborand are visible to q.

Neighborhood signatures for searching P2P networks,Mei Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam,Overlay networks have received a lot of attention due to the recent widespread use of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications such as SETI; Napster; Gnutella; and Morpheus. Throughreplications at numerous peers; digital content can be distributed or exchanged with highresilience and availability. However; existing P2P applications incur excessive overhead onnetwork traffic. For example; Gnutella; which broadcasts queries to search shared content;suffers from an overwhelming volume of query and reply messages.

Rule-based wifi localization methods,Qiuxia Chen; Dik-Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,The rule-based localization methods proposed in this paper are based on two importantobservations. First; although the absolute RSS values change with time; the relative RSS(RRSS) values between several Access Points (APs) are more stable than the absoluteRSSs. Thus; we can use RRSSs as rules for inferring a client's location. Second; when aunique location cannot be obtained based on RRSS rules; the localization process canbacktrack to the previous observed client location. By analyzing the accessible paths on thefloor plan; locations that are not reacheable from the previous location can be disqualified.Based on these two key observations; we propose several localization methods; implementthem in a life environment and conduct extensive experiments to measure the localizationaccuracy of the proposed methods. We found that our methods achieve much higher …,Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing; 2008. EUC'08. IEEE/IFIP International Conference on,2008,31
Semantic annotation of mobility data using social media,Fei Wu; Zhenhui Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Hongjian Wang; Zhuojie Huang,Abstract Recent developments in sensors; GPS and smart phones have provided us with alarge amount of mobility data. At the same time; large-scale crowd-generated social mediadata; such as geo-tagged tweets; provide rich semantic information about locations andevents. Combining the mobility data and surrounding social media data enables us tosemantically understand why a person travels to a location at a particular time (eg; attendinga local event or visiting a point of interest). Previous research on mobility data mining hasbeen mainly focused on mining patterns using only the mobility data. In this paper; we studythe problem of using social media to annotate mobility data. As social media data is oftennoisy; the key research problem lies in using the right model to retrieve only the relevantwords with respect to a mobility record.

Distributed caching of multi-dimensional data in mobile environments,Bin Liu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Caching has been an important technique for saving network traffic and reducingresponse time; especially in mobile environments where bandwidth is often a scarceresource. In this paper; we propose a novel approach for caching multidimensional data in acluster of mobile devices. In particular; we focus on the most common types of multi-dimensional queries; namely range and k-nearest neighbor queries; by computing acacheable region for every query; caching the result at the client; and indexing it in an R*-tree at the cluster gateway. Subsequent queries are first issued to the R*-tree and onlyremainder queries or queries that cannot be guaranteed exact answers are sent to theremote data server. To the best of our knowledge; our work is the first to study cachingresults from complex multi-dimensional queries (eg; kNN query) and propose to build an …,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,29
Supporting XML security models using relational databases: a vision,Dongwon Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Peng Liu,Abstract As the secure distribution and sharing of information over the World Wide Webbecomes increasingly important; the needs for flexible and efficient support of access controlsystems naturally arise. Since the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is emerging as theformat of the Internet era for storing and exchanging information; there have been; recently;many proposals to extend the XML model to incorporate security aspects. To the lesser orgreater extent; however; such proposals neglect the fact that the data for XML documentswill most likely reside in relational databases; and consequently do not utilize varioussecurity models proposed for and implemented in relational databases. In this paper; wetake a rather different approach. We explore how to support security models for XMLdocuments by leveraging on techniques developed for relational databases.

On social-temporal group query with acquaintance constraint,De-Nian Yang; Yi-Ling Chen; Wang-Chien Lee; Ming-Syan Chen,Abstract Three essential criteria are important for activity planning; including:(1) finding agroup of attendees familiar with the initiator;(2) ensuring each attendee in the group to havetight social relations with most of the members in the group; and (3) selecting an activityperiod available for all attendees. Therefore; this paper proposes Social-Temporal GroupQuery to find the activity time and attendees with the minimum total social distance to theinitiator. Moreover; this query incorporates an acquaintance constraint to avoid finding agroup with mutually unfamiliar attendees. Efficient processing of the social-temporal groupquery is very challenging. We show that the problem is NP-hard via a proof and formulatethe problem with Integer Programming. We then propose two efficient algorithms; SGSelectand STGSelect; which include effective pruning techniques and employ the idea of pivot …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,28
Using path information for query processing in object-oriented database systems,Dik L Lee; Wang-chien Lee,Abstract This paper argues that most queries in object-oriented databases require traversingfrom one object to another in the aggregation hierarchy. Thus; the connections betweenobjects through object identifiers are essential to the efficiency of query processing andshould be represented separately from the database. We introduce the concept of pathdictionary and describe how it supports queries of different types. We evaluate the storageoverhead; query and update costs of the path dictionary. Compared to the path index; thepath dictionary has better overall query and update performance and lower storageoverhead.,Proceedings of the third international conference on Information and knowledge management,1994,28
Maximizing acceptance probability for active friending in online social networks,De-Nian Yang; Hui-Ju Hung; Wang-Chien Lee; Wei Chen,Abstract Friending recommendation has successfully contributed to the explosive growth ofonline social networks. Most friending recommendation services today aim to supportpassive friending; where a user passively selects friending targets from the recommendedcandidates. In this paper; we advocate a recommendation support for active friending; wherea user actively specifies a friending target. To the best of our knowledge; a recommendationdesigned to provide guidance for a user to systematically approach his friending target hasnot been explored for existing online social networking services. To maximize the probabilitythat the friending target would accept an invitation from the user; we formulate a newoptimization problem; namely; Acceptance Probability Maximization (APM); and develop apolynomial time algorithm; called Selective Invitation with Tree and In-Node Aggregation …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,27
Distributed processing of probabilistic top-k queries in wireless sensor networks,Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee; Xingjie Liu,In this paper; we introduce the notion of sufficient set and necessary set for distributedprocessing of probabilistic top-k queries in cluster-based wireless sensor networks. Thesetwo concepts have very nice properties that can facilitate localized data pruning in clusters.Accordingly; we develop a suite of algorithms; namely; sufficient set-based (SSB); necessaryset-based (NSB); and boundary-based (BB); for intercluster query processing with boundedrounds of communications. Moreover; in responding to dynamic changes of data distributionin the network; we develop an adaptive algorithm that dynamically switches among the threeproposed algorithms to minimize the transmission cost. We show the applicability ofsufficient set and necessary set to wireless sensor networks with both two-tier hierarchicaland tree-structured network topologies.

One of the researchfocus is on pervasive data access. With wireless connections; users can access informationat any place at any time. However; various constraints such as limited client capability;limited bandwidth; weak connectivity; and client mobility impose many challenging technicalissues. In the past years; tremendous research efforts have been put forth to address theissues related to pervasive data access. A number of interesting research results werereported in the literature.

Compressing moving object trajectory in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Some object tracking applications can tolerate delays in data collection and processing.Taking advantage of the delay tolerance; we propose an efficient and accurate algorithm forin-network data compression; called delay-tolerant trajectory compression (DTTC). In DTTC;a cluster-based infrastructure is built within the network. Each cluster head compresses anobject's movement trajectory detected within its cluster by a compression function. Ratherthan transmitting all sensor readings to the sink node; the cluster head communicates onlythe compression parameters; which not only provide the sink node expressive yet traceablemodels about the object movements; but also significantly reduce the total amount of datacommunication required for tracking operations. DTTC supports a broad class of movementtrajectories using two proposed techniques; DC-compression and SW-compression; and …,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,2007,27
PENS: an algorithm for density-based clustering in peer-to-peer systems,Mei Li; Guanling Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam,Abstract Huge amounts of data are available in large-scale networks of autonomous datasources dispersed over a wide area. Data mining is an essential technology for obtaininghidden and valuable knowledge from these networked data sources. In this paper; weinvestigate clustering; one of the most important data mining tasks; in one of such networkedcomputing environments; ie; peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. The lack of a central control andthe sheer large size of P2P systems make the existing clustering techniques not applicablehere. We propose a fully distributed clustering algorithm; called Peer dENsity-basedcluStering (PENS); which overcomes the challenge raised in performing clustering in peer-to-peer environments; ie; cluster assembly. The main idea of PENS is hierarchical clusterassembly; which enables peers to collaborate in forming a global clustering model …,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Scalable information systems,2006,27
Key formulation schemes for spatial index in cloud data managements,Ya-Ting Hsu; Yi-Chin Pan; Ling-Yin Wei; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Due to the flexibility and scalability in cloud computing; cloud computing nowadays plays animportant role to handle a large-scale data analysis. For data processing operations; severalcloud data managements (CDMs); such as HBase and Cassandra; are developed. SuchCDMs usually provide key-value storages; where each key is used to access itscorresponding value. Both HBase and Cassandra provide some basic operations (eg; Get;Scan) to retrieve the values via keys specified by users. The exiting CDMs fully inherit thecharacteristics of cloud computing (ie; high scalability and availability). With theaforementioned characteristics of cloud computing; CDMs are widely employed for Webdata; especially for search engines.

Window query processing in highly dynamic geosensor networks: Issues and solutions,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,ABSTRACT Wireless sensor networks have recently received a lot of attention due to a widerange of applications such as object tracking; environmental monitoring; warehouseinventory; and health care [15; 29]. In these applications; physical data is continuouslycollected by the sensor nodes in order to facilitate application specific processing andanalysis. A database-style query interface is natural for development of applications andsystems on sensor networks. There are projects pursuing this research direction [13; 14; 25].However; these existing works have not yet explored the spatial property and the dynamiccharacteristics of sensor networks. In this paper; we investigate how to process a windowquery in highly dynamic GeoSensor networks and propose several innovative ideas onenabling techniques.

An optimal cache replacement policy for wireless data dissemination under cache consistency,Jianliang Xu; Qinglong Hu; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,A good cache management method for mobile wireless environments has to handleproblems associated with limited client resources and frequent client disconnections; inaddition to standard problems found in wired environments; such as variable data sizes anddata updates. In this paper we propose a gain-based cache replacement policy; Min-SAUD;for wireless data dissemination when cache consistency must be enforced before a cacheditem is used. Min-SAUD considers several factors that affect cache performance; namelyaccess probability; update frequency; data size; retrieval delay; and cache validation cost.Min-SAUD is optimal in terms of the stretch performance measure. Preliminary experimentalresults show that in most cases the Min-SAUD replacement policy substantially outperformstwo existing policies; namely LRU and SAIU.,Parallel Processing; 2001.

Clock: Synchronizing Internal Relational Storage with External XML Documents,Xin Zhang; Gail Mitchell; Wang-Chien Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner,In many business settings; a relational database system (RDBMS) will serve as the storagemanager for data from XML documents. In such a system; once the XML data is dissembledand loaded into the storage system; XML queries posed against the (virtual) XML documentsare processed by translating them into SQL queries against the relational storage. However;for applications which frequently update their XML documents; we cannot afford to reload acomplete; possibly large; document for each update; instead we must be able toincrementally propagate document updates to the stored XML data. We address the issue ofcorrectly reflecting updates of external XML documents into the loaded XML data in arelational database system. We describe Clock; a framework for synchronizing the relationalstorage with updated XML documents by exploiting a metadata-driven technology. First …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2001.

A comparison of indexing methods for data broadcast on the air,Qinglong Hu; Duk Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Several indexing techniques for data broadcast on the air have been proposed for powerconservation on mobile computers in the past few years. Indexing techniques for broadcastchannels can save battery power (estimated by tune-in time) while incurring only limitedoverhead on access time. In this paper we compare indexing techniques based on the indextree and the signature methods and find that both methods prevail under differentcircumstances.,Information Networking; 1998.(ICOIN-12) Proceedings.; Twelfth International Conference on,1998,26
PGT: Measuring mobility relationship using personal; global and temporal factors,Hongjian Wang; Zhenhui Li; Wang-Chien Lee,Rich location data of mobile users collected from smart phones and location-based socialnetworking services enable us to measure the mobility relationship strength based on theirinteractions in the physical world. A commonly-used measure for such relationship is thefrequency of meeting events (ie; Co-locate at the same time). That is; the more frequently twopersons meet; the stronger their mobility relationship is. However; we argue that not all themeeting events are equally important in measuring the mobility relationship and propose toconsider personal and global factors to differentiate meeting events. Personal factor modelsthe probability for an individual user to visit a certain location; whereas the global factormodels the popularity of a location based on the behavior of general public. In addition; weintroduce the temporal factor to further consider the time gaps between meeting events …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,25
Silence is also evidence: interpreting dwell time for recommendation from psychological perspective,Peifeng Yin; Ping Luo; Wang-Chien Lee; Min Wang,Abstract Social media is a platform for people to share and vote content. From the analysis ofthe social media data we found that users are quite inactive in rating/voting. For example; auser on average only votes 2 out of 100 accessed items. Traditional recommendationmethods are mostly based on users' votes and thus can not cope with this situation. Basedon the observation that the dwell time on an item may reflect the opinion of a user; we aim toenrich the user-vote matrix by converting the dwell time on items into users'``pseudovotes''and then help improve recommendation performance. However; it is challenging tocorrectly interpret the dwell time since many subjective human factors; eg user expectation;sensitivity to various item qualities; reading speed; are involved into the casual behavior ofonline reading. In psychology; it is assumed that people have choice threshold in …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,25
Making B+-tree efficient in PCM-based main memory,Ping Chi; Wang-Chien Lee; Yuan Xie,Abstract Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising technology for building future large-scale and low-power main memory systems. Main memory databases (MMDBs) can benefitfrom the high density of PCM. However; its long write latency; high write energy; and limitedlifetime; bring challenges to database algorithm design for PCM-based memory systems. Inthis paper; we focus on making B+-tree PCM-friendly by reducing the write accesses toPCM. We propose three different schemes. Experimental results show that they canefficiently improve the performance; reduce the memory energy consumption; and improvethe lifetime for PCM memory.,Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design,2014,24
Continuous all k-nearest-neighbor querying in smartphone networks,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Wang-Chien Lee; Marios D Dikaiakos,Consider a centralized query operator that identifies to every smartphone user its kgeographically nearest neighbors at all times; a query we coin Continuous All k-NearestNeighbor (CAkNN). Such an operator could be utilized to enhance public emergencyservices; allowing users to send SOS beacons out to the closest rescuers; allowing gamersand social networking users to establish ad-hoc overlay communication infrastructures; inorder to carry out complex interactions. In this paper; we study the problem of efficientlyprocessing a CAkNN query in a cellular or WiFi network; both of which are ubiquitous. Weintroduce an algorithm; coined Proximity; which answers CAkNN queries in O (n (k+ λ)) time;where n denotes the number of users and λ a network-specific parameter (λ<;<; n).

Finding skyline paths in road networks,Yuan Tian; Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract This paper presents a research study on skyline path queries. Given a source s anda destination d on a road network and multiple path search criteria (eg; short distance andshort travel time); a skyline query returns a set of non-dominated paths from s to d. Thesenon-dominated paths are called skyline paths. Efficient computation of skyline path queriesis very challenging due to expensive network traversals and extensive path comparisons indominance tests. In this paper; we explore the characteristics of skyline paths; based onwhich a novel skyline path search algorithm called SkyPath is proposed. To narrow downthe search scope for result skyline paths; partial dominance test and full path dominance testare devised as two components of SkyPath. Evaluation results show the superiority of theSkyPath algorithm over the state-of-the-art approaches.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,24
Personalized ranking for digital libraries based on log analysis,Yang Sun; Huajing Li; Isaac G Councill; Jian Huang; Wang-Chien Lee; C Lee Giles,Abstract Given the exponential increase of indexable context on the Web; ranking is anincreasingly difficult problem in information retrieval systems. Recent research shows thatimplicit feedback regarding user preferences can be extracted from web access logs in orderto increase ranking performance. We analyze the implicit user feedback from access logs inthe CiteSeer academic search engine and show how site structure can better inform theanalysis of clickthrough feedback providing accurate personalized ranking services tailoredto individual information retrieval systems. Experiment and analysis shows that ourproposed method is more accurate on predicting user preferences than any non-personalized ranking methods when user preferences are stable over time.

Indexing techniques for power management in multi-attribute data broadcast,Qinglong Hu; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract In this paper; we discuss the power conservative indexing techniques for managingmulti-attribute data broadcast on wireless channels. These indexing techniques; namely;index tree; signature and hybrid; aim at improving the battery power consumption of mobileclients. By taking into account the broadcast management factors such as clustering andscheduling; these three indexing schemes may significantly reduce tune-in time whilemaintaining a reasonable access time. Cost models for single and multi-attribute queryprocessing are developed. Our performance evaluation shows that the signature and hybridmethods are superior to the index tree method.,Mobile Networks and Applications,2001,24
A comfort measuring system for public transportation systems using participatory phone sensing,Cheng-Yu Lin; Ling-Jyh Chen; Ying-Yu Chen; Wang-Chien Lee,ABSTRACT Participatory phone sensing is a new sensing paradigm that asks volunteers tocontribute their phones' sensing capabilities and gather; analyze; and share localknowledge about their surroundings. While most existing participatory phone sensingsystems are standalone structures without cross-system integration; in this study; wepropose a novel Comfort Measuring System (CMS) for public transportation systems. CMSexploits the GPS and 3-axis accelerometer functions of modern smart phones to measurethe comfort level of vehicle rides. Then; it mashes up the sensed data with the authorizeddata of the public transportation system; and provides a detailed comfort statistics as a valueadded service. Using real data collected from a CMS deployed in Taipei City; we show thatthe system can achieve a high hit rate in trajectory matching of phone sensed data and …,ACM PhoneSense,2010,23
KTR: An efficient key management scheme for secure data access control in wireless broadcast services,Qijun Gu; Liu Peng; Lee Wang-Chien; Chu Chao-Hsien,Wireless broadcast is an effective approach for disseminating data to a number of users. Toprovide secure access to data in wireless broadcast services; symmetric-key-basedencryption is used to ensure that only users who own the valid keys can decrypt the data.With regard to various subscriptions; an efficient key management for distributing andchanging keys is in great demand for access control in broadcast services. In this paper; wepropose an efficient key management scheme; namely; key tree reuse (KTR); to handle keydistribution with regard to complex subscription options and user activities.

Decentralizing query processing in sensor networks,Ross Rosemark; W-C Lee,Recent research has led to the advent of software systems capable of performing queryprocessing in sensor networks. They perform query processing in a sensor network byconstructing a routing tree rooted at an access point (ie; a base station); where the queriesare submitted; parsed; and optimized. This approach to query processing is centralized innature. Performing query optimization at a single node (base station) does not generateefficient query plans; and requires each node to report metadata to the access point. Inaddition; the routing tree infrastructure inefficiently aggregates data packets. To addressthese issues; this paper proposes several decentralized query processing systems thatutilize sensor node's innate spatial and semantic characteristics. Experimental resultsconclude that decentralizing query processing significantly reduces energy costs. In …,Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking and Services; 2005. MobiQuitous 2005.

Authenticating location-based skyline queries in arbitrary subspaces,Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Wang-Chien Lee,With the ever-increasing use of smartphones and tablet devices; location-based services(LBSs) have experienced explosive growth in the past few years. To scale up services; therehas been a rising trend of outsourcing data management to Cloud service providers; whichprovide query services to clients on behalf of data owners. However; in this data-outsourcingmodel; the service provider can be untrustworthy or compromised; thereby returningincorrect or incomplete query results to clients; intentionally or not. Therefore; empoweringclients to authenticate query results is imperative for outsourced databases. In this paper; westudy the authentication problem for location-based arbitrary-subspace skyline queries(LASQs); which represent an important class of LBS applications.

We refer to such document search that considerssocial networks as social web search. In this paper; we focus on efficient top-k social websearch and propose two search strategies:(i) TR-based search and (ii) SI-based search thattailor document examination orders upon TR and SI; respectively. We evaluate the proposedstrategies through experimentation.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,22
Collaborative caching for spatial queries in mobile P2P networks,Qijun Zhu; Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,We propose a novel collaborative caching framework to support spatial query processing inMobile Peer-to-Peer Networks (MP2PNs). To maximize cache sharing among clients; eachclient caches not only data objects but also parts of the index structure built on the spatialobjects. Thus; we call the proposed method structure-embedded collaborative caching(SECC). By introducing a novel index structure called Signature Augment Tree (SAT); weaddress two crucial issues in SECC. First; we propose a cost-efficient collaborative queryprocessing method in MP2PNs; including peer selection and result merge from multiplepeers. Second; we develop a novel collaborative cache replacement policy whichmaximizes cache effectiveness by considering not only the peer itself but also its neighbors.We implement two SECC schemes; namely; the periodical and adaptive SAT-based …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,21
Channel allocation methods for data dissemination in mobile computing environments,W-C Lee; Qinglong Hu; Dik Lun Lee,We discuss several channel allocation methods for data dissemination in mobile computingsystems. We suggest that the broadcast and on-demand channels have different accessperformance under different system parameters and that a mobile cell should use acombination of both to obtain optimal access time for a given workload and systemparameters. We study the data access efficiency of three channel configurations: allchannels are used as on-demand channels (exclusive on-demand); all channels are usedfor broadcast (exclusive broadcast); and some channels are on-demand channels and someare broadcast channels (hybrid). Simulations on obtaining the optimal channel allocation forlightly-loaded; medium-loaded; and heavy-loaded conditions is conducted and the resultshows that an optimal channel allocation significantly improves the system performance.,High Performance Distributed Computing; 1997.

A lightweight multidimensional index for complex queries over dhts,Yuzhe Tang; Jianliang Xu; Shuigeng Zhou; Wang-Chien Lee; Dingxiong Deng; Yue Wang,In this paper; we study the problem of indexing multidimensional data in P2P networksbased on distributed hash tables (DHTs). We advocate the indexing approach thatsuperimposes a multidimensional index tree on top of a DHT-a paradigm that keeps theunderlying DHT intact while being able to adapt to any DHT substrate. In this context; weidentify several index design issues and propose a novel indexing scheme calledmultidimensional Lightweight Hash Tree (m-LIGHT). First; to preserve data locality; m-LIGHTemploys a clever naming mechanism that gracefully maps a tree-based index into the DHTand contributes to high efficiency in both index maintenance and query processing. Second;to tackle the load balancing issue; m-LIGHT leverages a new data-aware splitting strategythat achieves optimal load balance under a fixed index size.

Tuning on-air signatures for balancing performance and confidentiality,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Peng Liu; Dik Lun Lee; Xuhua Ding,In this paper; we investigate the trade off between performance and confidentiality insignature-based air indexing schemes for wireless data broadcast. Two metrics; namely;false drop probability and false guess probability; are defined to quantify the filteringefficiency and confidentiality loss of a signature scheme. Our analysis reveals that false dropprobability and false guess probability share a similar trend as the tuning parameters of asignature scheme change and it is impossible to achieve a low false drop probability and ahigh false guess probability simultaneously. In order to balance the performance andconfidentiality; we perform an analysis to provide a guidance for parameter settings of thesignature schemes to meet different system requirements. In addition; we propose the jumppointer technique and the XOR signature scheme to further improve the performance and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,19

Mining appliance usage patterns in smart home environment,Yi-Cheng Chen; Yu-Lun Ko; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Nowadays; due to the great advent of sensor technology; the data of all appliancesin a house can be collected easily. However; with a huge amount of appliance usage logdata; it is not an easy task for residents to visualize how the appliances are used. Miningalgorithms is necessary to discover appliance usage patterns that capture representativeusage behavior of appliances. If some of our representative patterns of appliance electricityusages are available; we may be able to adapt our usage behaviors to conserve the energyeasily. In this paper; we introduce (i) two types of usage patterns which capture therepresentative usage behaviors of appliances in a smart home environment and (ii) thecorresponding algorithms for discovering usage patterns efficiently. Finally; we apply ouralgorithms on a real-world dataset to show the practicability of usage pattern mining.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2013,18
Navigational path privacy protection: navigational path privacy protection,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Navigational path query; one of the most popular location-based services (LBSs);determines a route from a source to a destination on a road network. However; issuing pathqueries to some non-trustworthy service providers may pose privacy threats to the users. Forinstance; given a query requesting for a path from a residential address to a psychiatrist;some adversaries may deduce" who is related to what disease". In this paper; we present anobfuscator framework that reduces the likelihood of path queries being revealed; whilesupporting different user privacy protection needs and retaining query evaluation efficiency.The framework consists of two major components; namely; an obfuscator and an obfuscatedpath query processor.

Processing multiple aggregation queries in geo-sensor networks,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Julian Winter,Abstract To process aggregation queries issued through different sensors as access pointsin sensor networks; existing algorithms handle queries independently and perform in-network aggregation only at the query time. As a result of ad-hoc and independent executionof queries; no partial result is sharable and reusable among the queries. Consequently;scarce sensor network resources can be easily overconsumed; particularly; those sensorscommonly accessed by queries. In this paper; we address this issue by examining strategiesto maintain M aterialized I nN etwork V iews (MINV s) that pre-compute and store commonlyused aggregation results in the sensor network. With MINVs; aggregated sensed results forsome spatial regions are available and sharable to queries. Thus; the number of sensoraccesses is greatly reduced.

Indexing spatial data in cloud data managements,Ling-Yin Wei; Ya-Ting Hsu; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract With the proliferation of smart phones and location-based services; the amount ofdata with spatial information; referred to as spatial data; is dramatically increasing. Cloudcomputing plays an important role handling large-scale data analysis; and several clouddata managements (CDMs) have been developed for processing data. CDMs usuallyprovide key-value storage; where each key is used to access its corresponding value.However; user-generated spatial data are usually distributed non-uniformly. In this paper;we present a novel key design based on an R+-tree (KR+-index) for retrieving skewedspatial data efficiently. In the experiments; we implement the KR+-index on Cassandra; andstudy its performance using spatial data. Experiments show that the KR+-index outperformsthe-state-of-the-art methods.,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2014,17
Mining correlation patterns among appliances in smart home environment,Yi-Cheng Chen; Chien-Chih Chen; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Since the great advent of sensor technology; the usage data of appliances in ahouse can be logged and collected easily today. However; it is a challenge for the residentsto visualize how these appliances are used. Thus; mining algorithms are much needed todiscover appliance usage patterns. Most previous studies on usage pattern discovery aremainly focused on analyzing the patterns of single appliance rather than mining the usagecorrelation among appliances. In this paper; a novel algorithm; namely; Correlation PatternMiner (CoPMiner); is developed to capture the usage patterns and correlations amongappliances probabilistically. With several new optimization techniques; CoPMiner canreduce the search space effectively and efficiently. Furthermore; the proposed algorithm isapplied on a real-world dataset to show the practicability of correlation pattern mining.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,17

Probabilistic group recommendation model for crowdfunding domains,Vineeth Rakesh; Wang-Chien Lee; Chandan K Reddy,Abstract Crowdfunding has gained a widespread popularity by fueling the creative minds ofentrepreneurs. Not only has it democratized the funding of startups; it has also bridged thegap between the venture capitalists and the entrepreneurs by providing a plethora ofopportunities for people seeking to invest in new business ventures. Nonetheless; despitethe huge success of the crowdfunding platforms; not every project reaches its funding goal.One of the main reasons for a project's failure is the difficulty in establishing a linkagebetween it's founders and those investors who are interested in funding such projects.

HTTP: a new framework for bus travel time prediction based on historical trajectories,Wang-Chien Lee; Weiping Si; Ling-Jyh Chen; Meng Chang Chen,Abstract In this paper; we develop a new bus travel time prediction framework; calledHistorical Trajectory based Travel/Arrival Time Prediction (HTTP) for real-time prediction oftravel time over future segments (and thus the arrival time at stops) of an on-going busjourney. The basic idea behind HTTP is to use a collection of historical trajectories" similar"to the current bus trajectory to predict the future segments. Specifically; the HTTP framework(1) samples a set of similar trajectories as the basis for travel time estimation instead ofrelying on only one historical trajectory best matching the on-going bus journey; and (2)explores different prediction schemes; namely; passed segments; temporal features; andhybrid methods; to identify the sample set of similar trajectories. We conduct acomprehensive empirical experimentation using real bus trajectory data collected from …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,16
Boosting social network connectivity with link revival,Yuan Tian; Qi He; Qiankun Zhao; Xingjie Liu; Wang-chien Lee,Abstract Online social networking platforms have become a popular channel ofcommunications among people. However; most people can only keep in touch with a limitednumber of friends. This phenomenon results in a low-connectivity social network in terms ofcommunications; which is inefficient for information propagation and social engagement. Inthis paper; we introduce a new recommendation service; called link revival; that suggestsusers to re-connect with their old friends; such that the resulted connection will improve thesocial network connectivity. To achieve high connectivity improvement under the dynamicsocial network evolvement; we propose a graph prediction-based recommendation strategy;which selects proper candidates based on the prediction of their future behaviors. We thendevelop an effective model that exploits non-homogeneous Poisson process and second …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,16
A flexible framework for architecting XML access control enforcement mechanisms,Bo Luo; Dongwon Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Peng Liu,Abstract Due to the growing interest in XML security; various access control schemes havebeen proposed recently. However; little effort has been put forth to facilitate a uniformanalysis and comparison of these schemes under the same framework. This paper presentsa first attempt toward a flexible framework that can capture the design principles andoperations of existing XML access control mechanisms. Under this framework; we observethat most existing XML access control mechanisms share the same design principle withslightly different orderings of underlying building blocks (ie; data; query; and access controlrule). Furthermore; according to the framework; we identify four plausible approaches toimplement XML access controls; namely built-in; view-based; pre-processing and post-processing. Finally; we compare the actual performance of different approaches.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2004,16
Processing transitive nearest-neighbor queries in multi-channel access environments,Xiao Zhang; Wang-Chien Lee; Prasenjit Mitra; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Wireless broadcast is an efficient way for information dissemination due to its goodscalability [10]. Existing works typically assume mobile devices; such as cell phones andPDAs; can access only one channel at a time. In this paper; we consider a scenario of nearfuture where a mobile device has the ability to process queries using informationsimultaneously received from multiple channels. We focus on the query processing of thetransitive nearest neighbor (TNN) search [19]. Two TNN algorithms developed for a singlebroadcast channel environment are adapted to our new broadcast enviroment. Based on theobtained insights; we propose two new algorithms; namely Double-NN-Search and Hybrid-NN-Search algorithms. Further; we develop an optimization technique; called approximate-NN (ANN); to reduce the energy consumption in mobile devices. Finally; we conduct a …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,15
Tracking nearest surrounders in moving object environments,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong,This paper presents a system framework to support continuous nearest surrounder (NS)queries in moving object environments. NS query finds the nearest objects at individualdistinct angles from a query point. This query distinguishes itself from other conventionalspatial queries such as range queries and nearest neighbor queries by considering bothdistance and angular aspects of objects with respect to a query point. One of NS queryapplications is to monitor the nearest objects around an observation point. In our framework;a centralized server is dedicated to collect object location updates; to determine affected NSqueries of each object location update; to compute the incremental result change of affectedqueries and to deliver result updates to corresponding interested users/applications thatinitiate the queries. In particular; we propose algorithms namely; safe region formation …,Pervasive Services; 2006 ACS/IEEE International Conference on,2006,15
Caching complementary space for location-based services,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel client-side; multi-granularity caching scheme;called “Complementary Space Caching”(CS caching); for location-based services in mobileenvironments. Different from conventional data caching schemes that only cache a portion ofdataset; CS caching maintains a global view of the whole dataset. Different portions of thisview are cached in varied granularity based on the probabilities of being accessed in thefuture queries. The data objects with very high access probabilities are cached in the finestgranularity; ie; the data objects themselves. The data objects which are less likely to beaccessed in the near future are abstracted and logically cached in the form ofcomplementary regions (CRs) in a coarse granularity. CS caching naturally supports alltypes of location-based queries. In this paper; we explore several design and system …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,15
Mining GPS data for trajectory recommendation,Peifeng Yin; Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee; Zhenhui Li,Abstract The wide use of GPS sensors in smart phones encourages people to record theirpersonal trajectories and share them with others in the Internet. A recommendation serviceis needed to help people process the large quantity of trajectories and select potentiallyinteresting ones. The GPS trace data is a new format of information and few works focus onbuilding user preference profiles on it. In this work we proposed a trajectoryrecommendation framework and developed three recommendation methods; namely;Activity-Based Recommendation (ABR); GPS-Based Recommendation (GBR) and HybridRecommendation. The ABR recommends trajectories purely relying on activity tags. ForGBR; we proposed a generative model to construct user profiles based on GPS traces. TheHybrid recommendation combines the ABR and GBR. We finally conducted extensive …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,14
CV-PCR: a context-guided value-driven framework for patent citation recommendation,Sooyoung Oh; Zhen Lei; Wang-Chien Lee; Prasenjit Mitra; John Yen,Abstract Patent citation recommendation and prior patent search; critical for patent filing andpatent examination; have become increasingly difficult due to the rapidly growing number ofpatents. Unlike paper citations that focus on reference comprehensiveness; patent citationstend to be more parsimonious and refer only to those prior patents bearing significanttechnological and/or economic value; as they define the scope of the citing patent and thushave significant legal and economic implications. Based on the insight that patent citationsare important information reflecting the value of cited patents to the citing patent; we proposea heterogeneous patent citation-bibliographic network that combines patent citations(reflecting value relation) and bibliographic information (reflecting similarity relation)together. From this network; we extract various features that reflect the value of a prior …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,14
Mining fastest path from trajectories with multiple destinations in road networks,Eric Hsueh-Chan Lu; Wang-Chien Lee; Vincent S Tseng,Abstract Nowadays; research on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has received manyattentions due to its broad applications; such as path planning; which has become acommon activity in our daily life. Besides; with the advances of Web 2.0 technologies; usersare willing to share their trajectories; thus providing good resources for ITS applications. Tothe best of our knowledge; there is no study on the fastest path planning with multipledestinations in the literature. In this paper; we develop a novel framework; called Trajectory-based Path Finding (TPF); which is built upon a novel algorithm named Mining-basedAlgorithm for Travel time Evaluation (MATE) for evaluating the travel time of a navigationpath and a novel index structure named Efficient Navigation Path Search Tree (ENS-Tree)for efficiently retrieving the fastest path. With MATE and ENS-tree; an efficient fastest path …,Knowledge and information systems,2011,14
Monitoring minimum cost paths on road networks,Yuan Tian; Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract On a road network; the minimum cost path (or min-cost path for short) from a sourcelocation to a destination is a path with the smallest travel cost among all possible paths.Despite that min-cost path queries on static networks have been well studied; the problem ofmonitoring min-cost paths on a road network in presence of updates is not fully explored. Inthis paper; we present PathMon; an efficient system for monitoring min-cost paths in dynamicroad networks. PathMon addresses two important issues of the min-cost path monitoringproblem; namely;(i) path invalidation that identifies min-cost paths returned to path queriesaffected by network changes; and (ii) path update that replaces invalid paths with new onesfor those affected path queries. For (i); we introduce the notion of query scope; based onwhich a query scope index (QSI) is developed to identify affected path queries. For (ii); we …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,14
CME: A contour mapping engine in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Gail Mitchell,Contour maps; showing topological distribution of extracted features; are crucial for manyapplications. Building a dynamic contour map in a wireless sensor network is a challengingtask due to the constrained network resources. In this paper; we present the design of a {\emcontour mapping engine}(CME) in wireless sensor networks. Our design incorporates in-network processing based on binary classification to reduce the total number of activenodes. The underlying network architecture is analyzed to derive an optimal configuration.We show; by extensive simulations; the superiority of CME over the state-of-the-art contourmapping techniques.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008.

Identifying frequent items in p2p systems,Mei Li; Wang-Chien Lee,As peer-to-peer (P2P) systems receive growing acceptance; the need of identifying'frequentitems' in such systems appears in a variety of applications. In this paper; we define theproblem of identifying frequent items (IFI) and propose an efficient in-network processingtechnique; called in-network filtering (netFilter); to address this important fundamentalproblem. netFilter operates in two phases: 1) candidate filtering: data items are grouped intoitem groups to obtain aggregates for pruning of infrequent items; and 2) candidateverification: the aggregates for the remaining candidate items are obtained to filter out falsefrequent items. We address various issues faced in realizing netFilter; including aggregatecomputation; candidate set optimization; and candidate set materialization. In addition; weanalyze the performance of netFilter; derive the optimal setting analytically; and discuss …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08. The 28th International Conference on,2008,14
Optimizing parallel itineraries for knn query processing in wireless sensor networks,Tao-Young Fu; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Spatial queries for extracting data from wireless sensor networks are important formany applications; such as environmental monitoring and military surveillance. One suchquery is K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) query that facilitates sampling of monitored sensor datain correspondence with a given query location. Recently; itinerary-based KNN queryprocessing techniques; that propagate queries and collect data along a pre-determineditinerary; have been developed concurrently [12][14]. These research works demonstratethat itinerary-based KNN query processing algorithms are able to achieve better energyefficiency than other existing algorithms. However; how to derive itineraries based ondifferent performance requirements remains a challenging problem. In this paper; wepropose a new itinerary-based KNN query processing technique; called PCIKNN; that …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,14
Combining Indexing Technique with Path Dictionary for Nested Object Queries.,Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract A path dictionary encodes the connections among objects in the aggregationhierarchy. It has been shown to be an e cient mechanism for supporting nested objectqueries 6]. In this paper; we present a new method; called the path dictionary index method;which combines indexing techniques with the path dictionary method. We describe theoperations of the new mechanism and develop cost models for its storage overhead andquery and update costs. Finally; we compare the new mechanism to the path index method3]. The result shows that the path dictionary index method is signi cantly better than the pathindex method over a wide range of parameters.,DASFAA,1995,14
From face-to-face gathering to social structure,Chunyan Wang; Mao Ye; Wang-chien Lee,Abstract The rapid development of on-line social networking sites has dramatically changedthe way people live and communicate. One particularly interesting phenomena came alongwith this development is the prominent role of various on-line networking portals played inscheduling and organizing off-line group events and activities. In this paper; we focus onstudying the face-to-face (f2f) group formed through; or facilitated by; on-line portals. We firstshow the distinct characteristics of such f2f groups by analyzing datasets collected fromWhrrl and Meetup. Next; we propose a dynamic model for group gathering based on theprocess of friend invitation to interpret how a f2f group is formed on-line. The results of ourmodel are confirmed by empirical observations. Finally; we demonstrate that using suchgroup information can effectively improve the accuracies of social tie inference and friend …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,13
User association analysis of locales on location based social networks,Josh Jia-Ching Ying; Wang-Chien Lee; Mao Ye; Ching-Yu Chen; Vincent S Tseng,Abstract In recent years; location-based social networks (LBSNs) have received highattention. While this new breed of social networks is nascent; there is no large-scale analysisconducted to investigate the associations among users in locales of the network. In thispaper; we propose four locale based metrics; including Locale Clustering Coefficient; InwardLocale Transitivity; Locale Assortativity Coefficient; and Locale Assortability Coefficient tomake association analysis on EveryTrail; a popular LBSN specialized on sharing trips.Based on the analysis result; we observe that people who share more trajectories will getmore attention by other users; and people who are popular will connect to the people whoare also popular.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks,2011,13
QFilter: rewriting insecure XML queries to secure ones using non-deterministic finite automata,Bo Luo; Dongwon Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Peng Liu,Abstract In this paper; we ask whether XML access control can be supported whenunderlying (XML or relational) storage system does not provide adequate security featuresand propose three alternative solutions--primitive; pre-processing; and post-processing.Toward that scenario; in particular; we advocate a scalable and effective pre-processingapproach; called QFilter. QFilter is based on non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) andrewrites user's queries such that parts violating access control rules are pre-pruned.Through analysis and experimental validation; we show that (1) QFilter guarantees that onlypermissible portion of data is returned to the authorized users;(2) such access controls canbe efficiently enforced without relying on security features of underlying storage system; and(3) such independency makes QFilter capable of many emerging applications; such as in …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,13
Two sides of a coin: Separating personal communication and public dissemination accounts in Twitter,Peifeng Yin; Nilam Ram; Wang-Chien Lee; Conrad Tucker; Shashank Khandelwal; Marcel Salathé,Abstract There are millions of accounts in Twitter. In this paper; we categorize twitteraccounts into two types; namely Personal Communication Account (PCA) and PublicDissemination Account (PDA). PCAs are accounts operated by individuals and are used toexpress that individual's thoughts and feelings. PDAs; on the other hand; refer to accountsowned by non-individuals such as companies; governments; etc. Generally; Tweets in PDA(i) disseminate a specific type of information (eg; job openings; shopping deals; caraccidents) rather than sharing an individual's personal life; and (ii) may be produced by non-human entities (eg; bots). We aim to develop techniques for identifying PDAs so as to (i)facilitate social scientists to reduce “noise” in their study of human behaviors; and (ii) toindex them for potential recommendation to users looking for specific types of information …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,12
Collaborative spatial object recommendation in location based services,Gaurav Gupta; Wang-Chien Lee,Recommendation systems have found their ways into many on-line web applications; eg;product recommendation on Amazon and movie recommendation on Netflix. Particularly;collaborative filtering techniques have been widely used in these systems to personalize therecommendations according to the needs and tastes of users. In this paper; we applycollaborative filtering in spatial object recommendation which is essential in many locationbased services. Due to the large number of spatial objects and participating users; usingcollaborative filtering to obtain recommendations for a particular user can be very expensive.However; we observe that users tend to have affinity for some regions and argue that usingusers with similar regional bias in recommendation may help in reducing the search spaceof similar users. Thus; we propose two techniques; namely; Access Minimum Bounding …,Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW); 2010 39th International Conference on,2010,12
Personalized feed recommendation service for social networks,Huajing Li; Yuan Tian; Wang-Chien Lee; C Lee Giles; Meng-Chang Chen,Social network systems (SNSs) such as Facebook and Twitter have recently attractedmillions of users by providing social network based services to support easy messageposting; information sharing and inter-friend communication. With the rapid growth of socialnetworks; users of SNSs may easily get overwhelmed by the excessive volume ofinformation feeds and felt challenging to digest and find truly valuable information. In thispaper; we introduce a personalized feed recommendation service for SNS users based onuser interests and social network contexts. Our approach incorporates both the topicalpreference and topological locality of a user in determining a feed's relevance. We proposea popularity diffusion model to propagate feeds in social networks and support ourrecommendation service with a set of personalized indices for feed-based information …,Social Computing (SocialCom); 2010 IEEE Second International Conference on,2010,12
Optimizing energy-efficient query processing in wireless sensor networks,Ross Rosemark; Wang-Chien Lee; Bhuvan Urgaonkar,This paper studies the issues of energy-efficient query optimization for wireless sensornetworks. Different from existing query optimization techniques that consider only queryplans for extracting data from sensors at individual nodes; our approach takes into accountboth of the sensing and communication cost in query plans. Central to our study is a cost-based analysis; based on which the energy cost of candidate plans for a given query areestimated to determine a query plan that is likely to consume the least energy for execution.Simulation results show that the query plan chosen in our approach consumes significantlyless energy than an approach that optimizes on sensing cost only.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,12
Incremental adaptation of XPath access control views,Padmapriya Ayyagari; Prasenjit Mitra; Dongwon Lee; Peng Liu; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Materialized XPath access-control views are commonly used for enforcing accesscontrol. When access control rules defining a materialized XML access-control view change;the view must be adapted to reflect these changes. The process of updating a materializedview after its definition changes is referred to as view adaptation. While XPath security viewshave been widely reported in literature; the problem of view adaptation for XPath securityviews has not been addressed. View adaptation results in view downtime during whichusers are denied access to security views to prevent unauthorized access. Thus; efficientview adaptation is important for making XPath security views pragmatic. In this work; weshow how to adapt an XPath access-control view incrementally by re-using the existingview; which reduces computation and communication costs significantly; and results in …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2007,12
Distributed graph summarization,Xingjie Liu; Yuanyuan Tian; Qi He; Wang-Chien Lee; John McPherson,Abstract Graph has been a ubiquitous and essential data representation to model real worldobjects and their relationships. Today; large amounts of graph data have been generated byvarious applications. Graph summarization techniques are crucial in uncovering usefulinsights about the patterns hidden in the underlying data. However; all existing works ingraph summarization are single-process solutions; and as a result cannot scale to largegraphs. In this paper; we introduce three distributed graph summarization algorithms toaddress this problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can producegood quality summaries and scale well with increasing data sizes. To the best of ourknowledge; this is the first work to study distributed graph summarization methods.,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,11
Analyzing the social ties and structure of contributors in open source software community,Mohammad Y Allaho; Wang-Chien Lee,We conduct a statistical analysis on the social networks of contributors in Open SourceSoftware (OSS) communities using datasets collected from two most fast-growing OSSsocial interaction sites; Github. com and Ohloh. net. Our goal is to analyze the connectivitystructure of the social networks of contributors and to investigate the effect of the differentsocial tie structures on developers' overall productivity to OSS projects. We first analyze thegeneral structure of the social networks; eg; graph distances and the degree distribution ofthe social networks. Our analysis confirms that the social networks of OSS communitiesfollow power-law degree distributions and exhibit small-world characteristics. However; thedegree mixing pattern shows that high degree nodes tend to connect more with low degreenodes; suggesting collaborations between experts and newbie developers.

Efficient Valid Scope for Location-Dependent Spatial Queries in Mobile Environments.,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong; Brandon Unger; Baihua Zheng,Abstract—In mobile environments; mobile clients can access information with respect to theirlocations by submitting Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) to Location-BasedService (LBS) servers. Owing to scarce wireless channel bandwidth and limited clientbattery life; frequent LDSQ submission from clients must be avoided. Observing that LDSQsissued from a client located at nearby positions would likely return the same query results;we explore the idea of valid scope; which represents a spatial area in which a set of LDSQswill retrieve exactly the same set of query results. With a valid scope derived and an LDSQresult cached; a client can assert whether the new LDSQs can be answered with themaintained LDSQ result; thus eliminating the need of sending LDSQs to the server.Contention on the wireless channel and client energy consumed for data transmission …,JSW,2010,11
Workload analysis for scientific literature digital libraries,Huajing Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam; C Lee Giles,Abstract Workload studies of large-scale systems may help locating possible bottlenecksand improving performances. However; previous workload analysis for Web applications istypically focused on generic platforms; neglecting the unique characteristics exhibited invarious domains of these applications. It is observed that different application domains haveintrinsically heterogeneous characteristics; which have a direct impact on the systemperformance. In this study; we present an extensive analysis into the workload of scientificliterature digital libraries; unveiling their temporal and user interest patterns.

Geo-social group queries with minimum acquaintance constraints,Qijun Zhu; Haibo Hu; Cheng Xu; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract The prosperity of location-based social networking has paved the way for newapplications of group-based activity planning and marketing. While such applicationsheavily rely on geo-social group queries (GSGQs); existing studies fail to produce acohesive group in terms of user acquaintance. In this paper; we propose a new family ofGSGQs with minimum acquaintance constraints. They are more appealing to users as theyguarantee a worst-case acquaintance level in the result group. For efficient processing ofGSGQs on large location-based social networks; we devise two social-aware spatial indexstructures; namely SaR-tree and SaR*-tree. The latter improves on the former by consideringboth spatial and social distances when clustering objects. Based on SaR-tree and SaR*-tree; novel algorithms are developed to process various GSGQs.

Exploring pattern-aware travel routes for trajectory search,Ling-Yin Wei; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract With the popularity of positioning devices; Web 2.0 technology; and trip sharingservices; many users are willing to log and share their trips on the Web. Thus; trip planningWeb sites are able to provide some new services by inferring Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs) andrecommending popular travel routes from trip trajectories. We argue that simply providingsome travel routes consisting of popular ROIs to users is not sufficient. To tour around a widegeographical area; for example; a city; some users may prefer a trip to visit as many ROIs aspossible; while others may like to stop by only a few ROIs for an in-depth visit. We refer to atrip fitting the former user group as an in-breadth trip and a trip suitable for the latter usergroup as an in-depth trip. Prior studies on trip planning have focused on mining ROIs andtravel routes without considering these different preferences.

On bundle configuration for viral marketing in social networks,De-Nian Yang; Wang-Chien Lee; Nai-Hui Chia; Mao Ye; Hui-Ju Hung,Abstract Prior research on viral marketing mostly focuses on promoting one single productitem. In this work; we explore the idea of bundling multiple items for viral marketing andformulate a new research problem; called Bundle Configuration for SpreAd Maximization(BCSAM). Efficiently obtaining an optimal product bundle under the setting of BCSAM is verychallenging.

Materialized in-network view for spatial aggregation queries in wireless sensor network,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Julian Winter,Abstract Wireless sensor networks composed of battery-powered sensor nodes areinvaluable instruments for remote environment sensing. For sensor network applications;sensed readings are often collected in the form of aggregated data from a portion of asensor network as requested by spatial aggregation queries. In a large distributed sensornetwork; queries can be issued from various locations at any time. Existing in-network queryexecution techniques execute queries independently that considerably overconsumes theprecious energy of sensor nodes. As a result; the lifespan of a sensor network is inevitablyshortened. In this paper; we propose a Materialized In-Network View (MINV) framework thatprecalculates aggregated data from clusters of sensor nodes as intermediate query resultspreserved in the network and made ready for queries.

Existing works have typically focused on generic web workloads without puttingemphasis on specific domains. In this paper; we analyze the usage logs of CiteSeer; ascientific literature digital library and search engine; to characterize workloads for bothrobots and users. Essential ingredients that contribute to workloads are proposed. Amongthem we find the access intervals show high variance; and thus cannot be predicted wellwith time-series models.

Analysis of a loss-resilient proactive data transmission protocol in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; W-C Lee; Jianliang Xu,Many of sensor network applications require reliable data communication such that datapackets can be delivered to the destination without loss. However; existing reliabletransmission techniques either are too costly for resource-constrained sensor networks orhave limited capabilities for achieving desirable reliability. In this paper; an effective codingscheme that exploits the tradeoff between redundant data transmission andencoding/decoding complexity is proposed; with an in-depth study on two key designparameters; the degree of repair packets and the number of repair packets. Furthermore; theexpected probability of a destination obtaining all data packets under recoverable andpermanent failure model for proactive transmission is analyzed; respectively.

In DTTC; each cluster head compresses the movementtrajectory of a moving object by a compression function and reports only the compressionparameters; which drastically reduces the total amount of data communications required fortracking operations. DTTC supports a broad class of movement trajectories using twotechniques; DC-compression and SW-compression; which are designed to minimize thetotal number of segments to be compressed. Furthermore; we pro pose an efficient trajectorysegmentation scheme; which helps both compression techniques to compress movementtrajectory more accurately at less computation cost.

Theclustering index has been shown to be the best in terms of storage and retrieval costs.However; the non-clustering and semi-clustering indexes are also very efficient whencompared to traditional object traversal mechanisms.,Proceedings of the International Computer Symposium; Hsinchu; Taiwan,1994,10
Mining online social data for detecting social network mental disorders,Hong-Han Shuai; Chih-Ya Shen; De-Nian Yang; Yi-Feng Lan; Wang-Chien Lee; Philip S Yu; Ming-Syan Chen,Abstract An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs); such as Cyber-Relationship Addiction; Information Overload; and Net Compulsion; have been recentlynoted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed passively today; resultingin delayed clinical intervention. In this paper; we argue that mining online social behaviorprovides an opportunity to actively identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging todetect SNMDs because the mental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria(questionnaire) cannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach; new andinnovative to the practice of SNMD detection; does not rely on self-revealing of those mentalfactors via questionnaires. Instead; we propose a machine learning framework; namely;Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD); that exploits features extracted from …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,9
Significant correlation pattern mining in smart homes,Yi-Cheng Chen; Wen-Chih Peng; Jiun-Long Huang; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Owing to the great advent of sensor technology; the usage data of appliances in ahouse can be logged and collected easily today. However; it is a challenge for the residentsto visualize how these appliances are used. Thus; mining algorithms are much needed todiscover appliance usage patterns. Most previous studies on usage pattern discovery aremainly focused on analyzing the patterns of single appliance rather than mining the usagecorrelation among appliances. In this article; a novel algorithm; namely Correlation PatternMiner (CoPMiner); is developed to capture the usage patterns and correlations amongappliances probabilistically. CoPMiner also employs four pruning techniques and astatistical model to reduce the search space and filter out insignificant patterns; respectively.Furthermore; the proposed algorithm is applied on a real-world dataset to show the …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2015,9
On alleviating beacon overhead in routing protocols for urban VANETs,Yuya Sasaki; Wang-Chien Lee; Takahiro Hara; Shojiro Nishio,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been attracting increasing research interests forthe past decade. To address the routing problem; many protocols have been proposed inthe past several years. Routing protocols for VANETs; mostly based on the ideas of“Geographical Routing”(or geo-routing for short); typically have nodes periodically broadcastone-hop beacon messages to reveal their positions to neighbors. Nevertheless; packet lossand thus deterioration of routing performance in these protocols are anticipated in urbanareas due to high density of vehicles in the network. In this paper; we propose two newVANET routing protocols; namely; Routing Protocol with Beacon Control (RPBC) andRouting Protocol with BeaconLess (RPBL); to alleviate packet losses. In RPBC; each vehicledetermines whether to transmit a beacon message based on a new beacon control …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,9
Reverse ranking query over imprecise spatial data,Ken CK Lee; Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract The reverse rank of a (data) object o with respect to a given query object q (thatmeasures the relative nearness of q to o) is said to be k when q is the k-th nearest neighborof o in a geographical space. Based on the notion of reverse ranks; a< u> R</u> everse< u>R</u> anking (RR) query determines t objects with the smallest k's with respect to a givenquery object q. In many situations that locations of objects and a query object can beimprecise; objects would receive multiple possible k's. In this paper; we propose a notion ofexpected reverse ranks and evaluation of RR queries over imprecise data based onexpected reverse ranks. For any object o; an expected reverse rank kk is a weightedaverage of possible reverse ranks for individual instances of o with respect to differentinstances of a given query object q by taking their probabilities into account.

Efficient valid scope computation for location-dependent spatial queries in mobile and wireless environments,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong; Brandon Unger; Baihua Zheng,Abstract In mobile and wireless environments; mobile clients can access information withrespect to their locations by submitting Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) toLocation-Based Service (LBS) servers. Owing to scarce wireless channel bandwidth andlimited client battery life; frequent LDSQ submission from clients must be avoided. Observingthat LDSQs issued from similar client positions would normally return the same results; weexplore the idea of valid scope; that represents a spatial area in which a set of LDSQs willretrieve exactly the same query results. With a valid scope derived and an LDSQ resultcached at the client side; a client can assert whether the new LDSQs can be answered withthe maintained LDSQ result; thus eliminating the LDSQs sent to the server. As such;contention on wireless channel and client energy consumed for data transmission can be …,Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication,2009,9
Valid scope computation for location-dependent spatial query in mobile broadcast environments,Ken CK Lee; Josh Schiffman; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Wireless data broadcast is an efficient and scalable means to provide informationaccess for a large population of clients in mobile environments. With Location-BasedServices (LBSs) deployed upon a broadcast channel; mobile clients can collect data fromthe channel to answer their location-dependent spatial queries (LDSQs). Since the results ofLDSQs would become invalid when mobile client moves to new locations; the knowledge ofvalid scopes for LDSQ results is necessary to assist clients to determine if their previousLDSQ results can be reused after they moved. This effectively improves query response timeand client energy consumption. In this paper; we devise efficient algorithms to determinevalid scopes for various LDSQs including range; window and nearest neighbor queriesalong with LDSQ processing over a broadcast channel. We conduct an extensive set of …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,9
Energy-aware and time-critical geo-routing in wireless sensor networks,Yingqi Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Jianliang Xu; Gail Mitchell,Volunteer forwarding; as an emerging routing idea for large scale; location-aware wirelesssensor networks; has recently received significant attention. However; several criticalresearch issues raised by volunteer forwarding; including communication collisions;communication voids; and time-critical routing; have not been well addressed by the existingwork. In this paper; we propose a priority-based stateless geo-routing (PSGR) protocol thataddresses these issues. Based on PSGR; sensor nodes are able to locally determine theirpriority to serve as the next relay node using dynamically estimated network density. Thiseffectively suppresses potential communication collisions without prolonging routing delays.PSGR also overcomes the communication void problem using two alternative statelessschemes; rebroadcast and bypass. Meanwhile; PSGR supports routing of time-critical …,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,2008,9
CS cache engine: data access accelerator for location-based service in mobile environments,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Julian Winter; Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Location-based services (LBS) have emerged as one of the killer applications formobile and pervasive computing environments. Due to limited bandwidth and scarce clientresources; client-side data caching plays an important role of enhancing the data availabilityand improving the response time. In this demonstration; we present CS Cache Enginesuitable for LBS. The underlying caching model is Complementary Space Caching (CScaching) scheme that we have recently presented in [citation]. Different from conventionaldata caching schemes; CS caching preserves a global view of the database by maintainingphysical objects and capturing those objects in the server but not in the cache asComplementary Regions (CRs) in the cache. As a result; with the CS Cache Engineimplementing CS caching; client assertiveness on their own answered queries is …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,9

However; to offer new services through the integration ofWeb resources via Web API invocations; mobile mashup applications suffer from highenergy consumption and long response time. In this paper; we propose a proxy system andtwo techniques to reduce the size of data transfer; thereby enabling mobile mashupapplications to achieve energy-efficient and cost-effective Web API invocations. Specifically;we design an API query language that allows mobile mashup applications to readily specifyand obtain desired information by instructing a proxy to filter unnecessary information …,Wireless networks,2014,8
Spatial search for K diverse-near neighbors,Gregory Ference; Wang-Chien Lee; Hui-Ju Jung; De-Nian Yang,Abstract To many location-based service applications that prefer diverse results; findinglocations that are spatially diverse and close in proximity to a query point (eg; the currentlocation of a user) can be more useful than finding the k nearest neighbors/locations. In thispaper; we investigate the problem of searching for the k Diverse-Near Neighbors (kDNNs)}in spatial space that is based upon the spatial diversity and proximity of candidate locationsto the query point. While employing a conventional distance measure for proximity; wedevelop a new and intuitive diversity metric based upon the variance of the angles amongthe candidate locations with respect to the query point. Accordingly; we create a dynamicprogramming algorithm that finds the optimal kDNNs. Unfortunately; the dynamicprogramming algorithm; with a time complexity of O (kn 3); incurs excessive …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,8
On theme location discovery for travelogue services,Mao Ye; Rong Xiao; Wang-Chien Lee; Xing Xie,Abstract In this paper; we aim to develop a travelogue service that discovers and conveysvarious travelogue digests; in form of theme locations; geographical scope; travelingtrajectory and location snippet; to users. In this service; theme locations in a travelogue arethe core information to discover. Thus we aim to address the problem of theme locationdiscovery to enable the above travelogue services. Due to the inherent ambiguity of locationrelevance; we perform location relevance mining (LRM) in two complementary angles;relevance classification and relevance ranking; to provide comprehensive understanding oflocations. Furthermore; we explore the textual (eg; surrounding words) and geographical(eg; geographical relationship among locations) features of locations to develop a co-training model for enhancement of classification performance.

Selecting the best valid scopes for wireless dissemination of location-dependent data,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Mobility of user poses new challenges to research on spatial data access. Spatialdata cached in the mobile client may become invalid because of the movement of the client.To increase the reusability of the cached data; we can identify the valid scope of the spatialdata (ie; the spatial area within which the data is known to be valid) and save the valid scopeas well as the data in the cache. In this paper; we study issues on the dissemination ofspatial data and valid scopes in a wireless environment. We investigate methods forrepresenting valid scopes and their impacts on system performance. A genericrepresentation method; called the invalidation-efficiency-based (IEB) method; is proposed.Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance of IEB with otherrepresentation methods. Result shows that IEB is superior to the other methods because …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,8

These indexing methods show that battery power consumption in mobile clients canbe significantly reduced with some access time overhead. Among them; hybrid index is thebest choice for improving power efficiency under both scenarios of single and multipleattributes based queries.

When social influence meets item inference,Hui-Ju Hung; Hong-Han Shuai; De-Nian Yang; Liang-Hao Huang; Wang-Chien Lee; Jian Pei; Ming-Syan Chen,Abstract Research issues and data mining techniques for product recommendation and viralmarketing have been widely studied. Existing works on seed selection in social networks donot take into account the effect of product recommendations in e-commerce stores. In thispaper; we investigate the seed selection problem for viral marketing that considers botheffects of social influence and item inference (for product recommendation). We develop anew model; Social Item Graph (SIG); that captures both effects in the form of hyperedges.Accordingly; we formulate a seed selection problem; called Social Item MaximizationProblem (SIMP); and prove the hardness of SIMP.

Round-Eye: A system for tracking nearest surrounders in moving object environments,Ken CK Lee; Josh Schiffman; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong,Abstract This paper presents “Round-Eye”; a system for tracking nearest surrounding objects(or nearest surrounders) in moving object environments. This system provides a platform forsurveillance applications. The core part of this system is continuous nearest surrounder (NS)query that maintains views of the nearest objects at distinct angles from query points. Thisquery differs from conventional spatial queries such as range queries and nearest neighborqueries as NS query considers both distance and angular aspects of objects with respect toa query point at the same time. In our system framework; a centralized server is dedicated(1) to collect location updates of both objects and queries;(2) to determine which NS queriesare invalidated in presence of object/query location changes and corresponding resultchanges if any; and (3) to refresh the affected query answers.

Transitive nearest neighbor search in mobile environments,Baihua Zheng; Ken CK Lee; W-C Lee,Given a query point p; typically the position of a current client; and two datasets S and R; atransitive nearest neighbor (TNN) search returns a pair of objects (s; r) isinStimesR such thatthe total distance from p to s and then to r; ie; dis (p; s)+ dis (s; r); is minimum. We proposevarious algorithms for supporting TNN search as a kind of location-based services in both on-demand-based and broadcast-based mobile environments. In addition; we develop a novelvalidation algorithm that allows the clients to verify whether their TNN query answers are stillvalid after they moved to new positions. Finally; we conduct a comprehensive simulation toevaluate performance of the proposed TNN search algorithms,Sensor Networks; Ubiquitous; and Trustworthy Computing; 2006.

Querying uncertain minimum in wireless sensor networks,Mao Ye; Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Xingjie Liu; Meng-Chang Chen,In this paper; we introduce two types of probabilistic aggregation queries; namely;Probabilistic Minimum Value Queries (PMVQ) s and Probabilistic Minimum Node Queries(PMNQ) s. A PMVQ determines possible minimum values among all imprecise sensed data;while a PMNQ identifies sensor nodes that possibly provide minimum values. However;centralized approaches incur a lot of energy from battery-powered sensor nodes and well-studied in-network aggregation techniques that presume precise sensed data are notpractical to inherently imprecise sensed data. Thus; to answer PMVQs and PMNQs energy-efficiently; we devised suites of in-network algorithms. For PMVQs; our in-network minimumvalue screening algorithm (MVS) filters candidate minimum values; and our in-networkminimum value aggregation algorithm (MVA) conducts in-network probability calculation …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,6
A fully distributed spatial index for wireless data broadcast,Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng,To support location-based services in wireless data broadcast systems; a distributed spatialindex (called DSI) is proposed in this paper. DSI is highly efficient because it has a linear yetfully distributed structure that naturally facilitates multiple replications of the index by sharinglinks in different search trees. Search algorithms for point queries; window queries; and kNNqueries; based on DSI are presented. Empirical evaluation of DSI are conducted. Resultshows that DSI significantly out-performs R-tree and Hilbert curve index; two state-of-the-artspatial indexing techniques for wireless data broadcast.,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Trends and behavior of developers in open collaborative software projects,Mohammad Y Allaho; Wang-Chien Lee,We conduct an extensive analysis on the developers of Open Source Software (OSS)projects. Our goal is to discover trends that govern the developers' behavior in contributingto OSS projects. To achieve our goal; we define and analyze a set of developer and OSSproject features. Moreover; we study the behavior of the developers on selecting OSSprojects to participate in by analyzing the project features that dictate the developers'selection. In addition; we study the difference between developers who seek a job and whodo not seek a job in developing social ties. We; also; analyze the developers' affiliation (eg;corporate; university; Institute; etc.) and location (eg; city) statistics.

Efficient time series disaggregation for non-intrusive appliance load monitoring,Yao-Chung Fan; Xingjie Liu; Wang-Chien Lee; Arbee LP Chen,The growing concerns on urgent environmental and economical issues; such as globalwarming and rising energy cost; have motivated research studies on various greencomputing technologies. For example; Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitor (NIALM)techniques; aiming at energy monitoring; load forecasting and improved control ofresidential electrical appliances; have been developed by monitoring one electrical circuitthat contains a number of electrical appliances without using separate sub-meters. Byemploying pattern recognition algorithms; the NIALM techniques estimate the consumptionof individual appliances. While the basic ideas behind the NIALM techniques are valid;existing proposals suffer from the issue of poor estimation accuracy.

K-selection query over uncertain data,Xingjie Liu; Mao Ye; Jianliang Xu; Yuan Tian; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract This paper studies a new query on uncertain data; called k-selection query. Givenan uncertain dataset of N objects; where each object is associated with a preference scoreand a presence probability; ak-selection query returns k objects such that the expectedscore of the “best available” objects is maximized. This query is useful in many applicationdomains such as entity web search and decision making. In evaluating k-selection queries;we need to compute the expected best score (EBS) for candidate k-selection sets andsearch for the optimal selection set with the highest EBS. Those operations are costly due tothe extremely large search space. In this paper; we identify several important properties of k-selection queries; including EBS decomposition; query recursion; and EBS bounding.

Understanding sub-stream scheduling in P2P hybrid live streaming systems,Zhenjiang Li; Danny HK Tsang; Wang-Chien Lee,The P2P pull-push hybrid architecture has achieved great success in delivering live videotraffic over the Internet. However; a formal study on the sub-stream scheduling problem; akey design issue in hybrid systems; is still lacking. In this paper; we propose a max-flowmodel for mathematical analysis of this problem. We find that the sub-stream schedulingschemes used in existing hybrid systems; including CoolStreaming+; GridMedia andLStreaming; individually solve one special case of the proposed max-flow model. Moreover;this model can also serve as a benchmark to assess the performance of these existing sub-stream scheduling schemes. Further; we propose a weighted max-flow scheme to addressthe issue of peer heterogeneity in scheduling sub-streams.

OPAQUE: protecting path privacy in directions search,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong; Baihua Zheng,Directions search returns the shortest path from a source to a destination on a road network.However; the search interests of users may be exposed to the service providers; thus raisingprivacy concerns. For instance; a path query that finds a path from a resident address to aclinic may lead to a deduction about" who is related to what disease". To protect user privacyfrom accessing directions search services; we introduce the OPAQUE system; whichconsists of two major components:(1) an obfuscator that formulates obfuscated path queriesby mixing true and fake sources/destinations; and (2) an obfuscated path query processorinstalled in the server for obfuscated path query processing. OPAQUE reduces the likelihoodof path queries being revealed and allows retrieval of requested paths. We propose twotypes of obfuscated path queries; namely; independently obfuscated path query and …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,5
Exploiting spatial and data correlations for approximate data collection in wireless sensor networks,Chih-Chieh Hung Wen-Chih Peng; York Shang-Hua Tsai; Wang-Chien Lee,ABSTRACT Sensor nodes with similar readings can be grouped such that only readingsfrom representative nodes need to be reported. However; efficiently identifying the sensorgroups and their representative nodes is a very challenging task. In this paper; we proposean algorithm; namely DCglobal; to determine a set of representative nodes that have highenergy levels and wide data coverage ranges; where a data coverage range of a sensornode is the set of sensor nodes whose reading vectors are very close to the sensor node.Furthermore; a maintenance mechanism is proposed to dynamically select alternativerepresentative nodes when the representative nodes have less energy or representativenodes can no longer capture spatial correlation within their data coverage ranges.

Adapting $\text {B}^{+} $-Tree for Emerging Nonvolatile Memory-Based Main Memory,Ping Chi; Wang-Chien Lee; Yuan Xie,Among the emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies; some resistive memories;including phase change memory (PCM); spin-transfer torque magnetic random accessmemory (STT-RAM); and metal-oxide resistive RAM (ReRAM); have been considered aspromising replacements of conventional dynamic RAM (DRAM) to build future main memorysystems. Main memory databases can benefit from their nice features; such as their lowleakage power and nonvolatility; the high density of PCM; the good read performance andlow read energy consumption of STT-RAM; and the low cost of ReRAM's crossbararchitecture.

Path planning; a fundamental function of road network navigation services; finds aroute between the specified start location and destination. The efficiency of this pathplanning function is critical for mobile users on roads due to various dynamic scenarios;such as a sudden change in driving direction; unexpected traffic conditions; lost or unstableGPS signals; and so on. In these scenarios; the path planning service needs to be deliveredin a timely fashion.

A novel system for extracting useful correlation in smart home environment,Yi-Cheng Chen; Wen-Chih Peng; Wang-Chien Lee,Owing to the great advent of sensor technology; the usage data of appliances in a housecan be logged and collected easily today. However; it is a challenge for the residents tovisualize how these appliances are used. Thus; mining algorithms are much needed todiscover appliance usage patterns. Most previous studies on usage pattern discovery aremainly focused on analyzing the patterns of single appliance rather than mining the usagecorrelation among appliances. In this paper; a novel system; namely; Correlation PatternMining System (CPMS); is developed to capture the usage patterns and correlations amongappliances. With several new optimization techniques; CPMS can reduce the search spaceeffectively and efficiently. Furthermore; the proposed algorithm is applied on a real-worlddataset to show the practicability of correlation pattern mining.,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,4

Conventional geotagging systems sharesome limitations; such as the use of a two-phase operating model and the tendency to tagpopular objects with simple contexts. To address these problems; a number of geotaggingsystems based on the concept of 'Games with a Purpose'(GWAP) have been developedrecently. In this study; we use analysis to investigate these new systems. Based on ouranalysis results; we design three metrics to evaluate the system performance; and developfive task assignment algorithms for GWAP-based systems.

Location-dependent spatial query containment,Ken CK Lee; Brandon Unger; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Nowadays; location-related information is highly accessible to mobile users viaissuing Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) with respect to their locationswirelessly to Location-Based Service (LBS) servers. Due to the limited mobile device batteryenergy; scarce wireless bandwidth; and heavy LBS server workload; the number of LDSQssubmitted over wireless channels to LBS servers for evaluation should be minimized asappropriate. In this paper; we exploit query containment techniques for LDSQs (called LDSQcontainment) to enable mobile clients to determine whether the result of a new LDSQ Q′ iscompletely covered by that of another LDSQ Q previously answered by a server (denoted byQ′⊆ Q) and to answer Q′ locally if Q′⊆ Q. Thus; many LDSQs can be reduced fromserver evaluation. To support LDSQ containment; we propose a notion of containment …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2011,4
Compressing trajectories using inter-frame coding,Cheng-Yu Lin; Hung-Chia Chen; Ying-Yu Chen; Wang-Chien Lee; Ling-Jyh Chen,Abstract With the advances in wireless communications and GPS technology; there isincreasing interest in the field of location-aware services. Because of the proliferation of GPS-enabled devices and applications; in this study; we address the scalability issue in trajectorydata management. Specifically; we propose a scheme called Inter-Frame Coding (IFC) forlossless compression of trajectory data; and implement two classical database queriesbased on the scheme. Evaluations of the IFC scheme using real trajectory datasets showthat it can achieve a compression ratio of 58%. Moreover; it can reduce the computationalcomplexity of range queries by a factor of 0.45; while maintaining an acceptable executiontime in k-nearest neighbor searches. The IFC scheme is simple; efficient; and lossless; thus;it has the potential to facilitate trajectory-based data storage; compression; and …,*,2010,4
Supporting K nearest neighbors query on high-dimensional data in P2P systems,Mei Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Anand Sivasubramaniam; Jizhong Zhao,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems have been widely used for sharing and exchanging data andresources among numerous computer nodes. Various data objects identifiable with highdimensional feature vectors; such as text; images; genome sequences; are starting toleverage P2P technology. Most of the existing works have been focusing on queries on dataobjects with one or few attributes and thus are not applicable on high dimensional dataobjects. In this study; we investigate K nearest neighbors query (KNN) on high dimensionaldata objects in P2P systems. Efficient query algorithm and solutions that address varioustechnical challenges raised by high dimensionality; such as search space resolution andincremental search space refinement; are proposed. An extensive simulation using bothsynthetic and real data sets demonstrates that our proposal efficiently supports KNN …,Frontiers of Computer Science in China,2008,4
Wavenet: A Wavelet-based Approach to Monitor Changes on Data Distribution in Networks,Mei Li; Ping Xia; Wang-Chien Lee,A massive amount of data is available in distributed fashion on various networks; includingInternet; peer-to-peer networks; and wireless sensor networks. Users are often interested inmonitoring interesting patterns or abnormal events hidden in these data. Transferring all theraw data from each host node to a central coordinator for processing is costly andunnecessary. In this study; we investigate the problem of monitoring changes on the datadistribution in the networks (MCDN). To address this problem; we propose a technique;called wavenet; by compressing the local item set in each host node into a compact yetaccurate summary; called local wavelet; for communication with the coordinator. We alsopropose adaptive monitoring to address the issues of local wavelet propagation in wavenet.An extensive performance evaluation has been conducted to validate our proposal and …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008.

Integrating XML Data with Relational Databases.,Wang-Chien Lee; Gail Mitchell; Xin Zhang,Abstract XML technology is pushing the world into the e-commerce era. Relational databasesystems; today's dominant data management tool for business; must be able toaccommodate the XML data; since collecting; analyzing; mining and managing that data willbe tremendously important tasks. In this paper; we investigate the problem of managing XMLdata in relational database systems. We are specifically concerned with storing andaccessing the XML data using relational technology. We propose an algorithm for mappinga DTD to the Entity-Relationship (ER) model (and thus the relational model) and examinesome of the issues in loading XML data into the generated model.,ICDCS Workshop of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in the World-Wide Web,2000,4
Routing and scheduling of social influence diffusion in online social networks,Hui-Ju Hung; De-Nian Yang; Wang-Chien Lee,Owing to the rising popularity of online social networking services (OSNs); studies on socialinfluence and its diffusion have received significant attention from the research community.Prior research has mostly studied the impact of single-hop influence diffusion and multi-hopinfluence broadcast in online social networks. Very little research explores the idea ofguiding (routing) multi-hop social influence towards a specific target. In this paper; wemotivate the needs of timely routing social influence to formulate a new optimizationproblem; namely; Routing And Scheduling of Target-Oriented Social Influence Diffusion(RAS-TOSID). Accordingly; we propose the Efficient Routing And Scheduling with Socialand Temporal decOmposition (ERASSTO) algorithm; which finds the optimal solution to RAS-TOSID in polynomial time.

Maximizing friend-making likelihood for social activity organization,Chih-Ya Shen; De-Nian Yang; Wang-Chien Lee; Ming-Syan Chen,Abstract The social presence theory in social psychology suggests that computer-mediatedonline interactions are inferior to face-to-face; in-person interactions. In this paper; weconsider the scenarios of organizing in person friend-making social activities via onlinesocial networks (OSNs) and formulate a new research problem; namely; Hop-boundedMaximum Group Friending (HMGF); by modeling both existing friendships and the likelihoodof new friend making. To find a set of attendees for socialization activities; HMGF is uniqueand challenging due to the interplay of the group size; the constraint on existing friendshipsand the objective function on the likelihood of friend making. We prove that HMGF is NP-Hard; and no approximation algorithm exists unless P= NP. We then propose an error-bounded approximation algorithm to efficiently obtain the solutions very close to the …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,3
Sky R-tree: an index structure for distance-based top-k query,Yuya Sasaki; Wang-Chien Lee; Takahiro Hara; Shojiro Nishio,Abstract Searches for objects associated with location information and non-spatial attributeshave increased significantly over the years. To address this need; a top-k query may beissued by taking into account both the location information and non-spatial attributes. Thispaper focuses on a distance-based top-k query which retrieves the best objects based ondistance from candidate objects to a query point as well as other non-spatial attributes. Inthis paper; we propose a new index structure and query processing algorithms for distance-based top-k queries. This new index; called SKY R-tree; drives on the strengths of R-treeand Skyline algorithm to efficiently prune the search space by exploring both the spatialproximity and non-spatial attributes. Moreover; we propose a variant of SKY R-tree; calledS2KY R-tree which incorporates a similarity measure of non-spatial attributes.

Measuring user preference changes in digital libraries,Yang Sun; Huajing Li; Isaac G Councill; Wang-Chien Lee; C Lee Giles,Abstract Much research has been conducted using web access logs to study implicit userfeedback and infer user preferences from clickstreams. However; little research measuresthe changes of user preferences of ranking documents over time. We present a study thatmeasures the changes of user preferences based on an analysis of access logs of a largescale digital library over one year. A metric based on the accuracy of predicting future useractions is proposed. The results show that although user preferences change over time; themajority of user actions should be predictable from previous browsing behavior in the digitallibrary.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,3
A path-based approach for efficient evaluation of twig queries over XML data,Ya-Hui Chang; Cheng-Ta Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Efficient XML query processing has been a critical issue for these days. In this paper; a path-based approach is proposed to process XML queries which can be represented as a querytree with twig patterns. We summarize and encode all the possible paths in the XML data inadvance; so that we could efficiently determine where the physical paths; which satisfy theconstraint of individual path expressions in the input query; need to be “glued” to form thefinal correct match. We have conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performanceof the proposed system. The results show that our approach has a great advantage over thestate-of-the-art element-based or hybrid approach.,Journal of information science and engineering,2007,3
Location-Aware Wireless Sensor Networks,Wang-Chien Lee; Yingqi Xu,There are many studies in the literature addressing various issues concerning networkservices of wireless sensor networks.

Data access techniques for location-based services,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Location based service (LBS) is emerging as a killer application in mobile data servicesthanks to the rapid development in wireless communication and location positioningtechnologies. Users with location-aware wireless devices can query about theirsurroundings (eg; finding the nearest Japanese restaurant or all shopping malls within 5miles) at any place; anytime. While this ubiquitous computing paradigm brings greatconvenience for information access; the constraints of mobile environments; the spatialproperty of location-dependent data; and the mobility of mobile users pose a great challengefor the provision of location-based services to mobile users.

An efficient trajectory index structure for moving objects in location-based services,Jae-Woo Chang; Jung-Ho Um; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Because moving objects usually moves on spatial networks; efficient trajectoryindex structures are required to gain good retrieval performance on their trajectories.However; there has been little research on trajectory index structure for spatial networks; likeroad networks. In this paper; we propose an efficient trajectory index structure for movingobjects in Location-based Services (LBS). For this; we design our access scheme forefficiently dealing with the trajectories of moving objects on road networks. In addition; weprovide both an insertion algorithm to store the initial information of moving objecttrajectories and one to store their segment information. We also provide a retrieval algorithmto find a set of moving objects whose trajectories match the segments of a query trajectory.Finally; we show that our trajectory access scheme achieves about one order of …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2005,3

In thispaper; we address the issues involved in information search and access in IMANET. Abroadcast based Simple Search (SS) algorithm and an aggregate caching mechanism areproposed for improving the information accessibility and reducing average communicationlatency in IMANET. We evaluate the impact of caching; cache management; and accesspoints; which are connected to the Internet; through extensive simulation. The simulationresults indicate that the proposed aggregate cache can significantly improve an IMANETperformance in terms of throughput and average number of hops to access data.,WWW (Posters),2003,3
Models and infrastructures for pervasive computing,Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,4 Summary Pervasive computing refers to computing environments consisting of a largenumber of computing devices or information appliances embedded everywhere in our livingenvironment. While pervasive computing may exist in different forms; a general theme is thatit is massive in terms of the number of devices involved but at the same time invisible to theusers in terms of user-friendliness. In this paper; we point out two important aspects ofpervasive computing; namely; model and infrastructure. Because of the mobile and transientservices in a pervasive computing environment; special attention on the spatial andtemporal aspects of modeling; dynamic and recursive composition of services; andinfrastructures that match requests to services in a scalable manner are needed.

With increasedpatients in addictive Internet use; clinicians often form support groups to help patients. Thishas become a trend because groups organized around therapeutic goals can effectivelyenrich members with insight and guidance while holding everyone accountable along theway. With the emergence of online social network services; there is a trend to form supportgroups online with the aid of mental health professionals. Nevertheless; it becomesimpractical for a psychiatrist to manually select the group members because she faces anenormous number of candidates; while the selection criteria are also complicated since theyspan both the social and symptom dimensions.

Our goal is to analyze theconnectivity structure of the social networks of contributors and to investigate the effect of thedifferent social ties structures on developers' overall productivity to OSS projects. We; first;analyze the general structure of the social networks; eg; graph distances and the degreedistribution of the social networks.

Exploring legal patent citations for patent valuation,Shuting Wang; Zhen Lei; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Effective patent valuation is important for patent holders. Forward patent citations;widely used in assessing patent value; have been considered as reflecting knowledge flows;just like paper citations. However; patent citations also carry legal implication; which isimportant for patent valuation. We argue that patent citations can either be technologicalcitations that indicate knowledge transfer or be legal citations that delimit the legal scope ofciting patents. In this paper; we first develop citation-network based methods to infer patentquality measures at either the legal or technological dimension. Then we propose aprobabilistic mixture approach to incorporate both the legal and technological dimensions inpatent citations; and an iterative learning process that integrates a temporal decay functionon legal citations; a probabilistic citation network based algorithm and a prediction model …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,2
Increasing the responsiveness of recommended expert collaborators for online open projects,Mohammad Y Allaho; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract We consider the experts recommendation problem for open collaborative projectsin large-scale Open Source Software (OSS) communities. In large-scale online community;recommending expert collaborators to a project coordinator or lead developer has twoprominent challenges:(i) the" cold shoulder"'problem; which is the lack of interest from theexperts to collaborate and share their skills; and (ii) the" cold start" problem; which is anissue with community members who has scarce data history.

Recommending missing citations for newly granted patents,Sooyoung Oh; Zhen Lei; Wang-Chien Lee; John Yen,The US recently adopted a post-grant opposition procedure to encourage third parties tochallenge the validity of newly granted patents by providing relevant prior patents that aremissed during patent examination (ie; missing citations). In this paper; we propose arecommendation system for missing citations for newly granted patents. Therecommendation system; based on the patent citation network of a newly granted querypatent; focuses on paths that start with the references of the query patent in the network. Ourapproach is to identify the relevancy of a candidate patent to the query patent by its citationrelationship (paths) that are distinguished based on the direction; topology and semantics ofthe paths in the network. We consider six different types of paths between a candidate patentand a query patent based on their citation relationship and define a relevancy score for …,Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA); 2014 International Conference on,2014,2

We consider applications where eachBSD is hosted on a server or site connected to a communication network and the BSDsoverlap in their coverage areas. The challenge is to query the distributed BSDs to retrieve allobjects and to minimize the unknown regions which may contain objects satisfying thequery; while minimizing the data transmission volume and number of interactions betweenthe query client and the sites.

Patent Evaluation Based on Technological Trajectory Revealed in Relevant Prior Patents,Sooyoung Oh; Zhen Lei; Wang-Chien Lee; John Yen,Abstract It is a challenging task for firms to assess the importance of a patent and identifyvaluable patents as early as possible. Counting the number of citations received is a widelyused method to assess the value of a patent. However; recently granted patents have fewcitations received; which makes the use of citation counts infeasible. In this paper; wepropose a novel idea to evaluate the value of new or recently granted patents usingrecommended relevant prior patents. Our approach is to exploit trends in temporal patternsof relevant prior patents; which are highly related to patent values. We evaluate theproposed approach using two patent value evaluation tasks with a large-scale collection ofUS patents. Experimental results show that the models created based on our ideasignificantly enhance those using the baseline features or patent backward citations.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,2

Distinguished from existing work; DISQO aims at achieving high scalability andsystem performance in support of both snapshot and continuous spatial queries over movingobjects. The design of DISQO is based on our observation that exchanging object locationinformation and query information between the location server and moving objects canreduce communication cost and facilitate scalable query processing. Thus; DISQO is builtupon the notions of roaming regions and query maps in correspondence with object locationinformation and query information.

Balancing performance and confidentiality in air index,Qingzhao Tan; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Peng Liu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Studies on the performance issues (ie; access latency and energy conservation) ofwireless data broadcast have appeared in the literature. However; the important securityissues have not been well addressed. This paper investigates the tradeoff betweenperformance and security of signature-based air index schemes in wireless data broadcast.From the performance perspective; keeping low false drop probability helps clients retrievethe information from a broadcast channel efficiently. Meanwhile; from the securityperspective; achieving high false guess probability prevents the hacker from guessing theinformation easily. There is a tradeoff between these two aspects. An administrator of thewireless broadcast system may balance this tradeoff by carefully configuring the signaturesused in broadcast.

On signature caching of wireless broadcast and filtering services,Dik Lun Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract This paper discusses signature caching strategies to reduce power consumption forwireless broadcast and filtering services. Four caching policies are compared in terms oftune-in time and access time. With reasonable access time delay; all of the caching policieshelp in reducing tune-in time for the two-level signature scheme. Moreover; two cachereplacement policies are presented and compared by simulation. The result shows that;when the cache size is small; caching only the integrated signatures is recommended. Whenthe size of cache is greater than that of the integrated signatures; caching both of theintegrated and simple signatures is better.,Proc. of the 2nd Int. Mobile Computing Workshop,1996,2
HIN2Vec: Explore Meta-paths in Heterogeneous Information Networks for Representation Learning,Tao-yang Fu; Wang-Chien Lee; Zhen Lei,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel representation learning framework; namelyHIN2Vec; for heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The core of the proposedframework is a neural network model; also called HIN2Vec; designed to capture the richsemantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes.Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN; HIN2Vec carries outmultiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latentvectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design; several issuesunique to HIN2Vec; including regularization of meta-path vectors; node type selection innegative sampling; and cycles in random walks; are examined.

However; finding socially tenuous groups also has many importantapplications. In this paper; we introduce the notion of k-triangles to measure the tenuity of agroup. We then formulate a new research problem; Minimum k-Triangle DisconnectedGroup (MkTG); to find a socially tenuous group from online social networks. We prove thatMkTG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any ratio in arbitrary graphs but polynomial-time tractable in threshold graphs. Two algorithms; namely TERA and TERA-ADV; aredesigned to exploit graph-theoretical approaches for solving MkTG on general graphseffectively and efficiently.

In this article; we propose aframework for business-location planning that takes into account both factors ofgeographical proximity and social influence. An essential task in this framework is tocompute the “influence spread” of RNNs for candidate locations.

A natural generalizationof continuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN); an RONN query retrieves the obstructednearest neighbor for every point in a specified range. To process RONN; we first propose aCONN-Based (CONNB) algorithm as our baseline; which reduces the RONN query into arange query and four CONN queries processed using an R-tree.

For a given query location q; NWC (q; l; w; n) retrieves n objectswithin a window of length l and width w; where the distance between the query location q tothese n objects is the shortest. To facilitate efficient NWC query processing; we identifyseveral properties and accordingly develop an NWC algorithm. Moreover; we proposeseveral optimization techniques to further reduce the search cost. To validate our ideas; weconduct a comprehensive performance evaluation using both real and synthetic datasets.Experimental results show that the proposed NWC algorithm; along with the optimizationtechniques; is very efficient under various datasets and parameter settings.,EDBT,2016,1
Patent Citation Recommendation for Examiners,Tao-yang Fu; Zhen Lei; Wang-Chien Lee,There is a consensus that US patent examiners; who are responsible for identifying prior artrelevant to adjudication of patentability of patent applications; often lack the time; resourcesand/or experience necessary to conduct a dequateprior art search. This study aims to buildan automatic and effective system of patent citation recommendation for patent examiners. Inaddition to focusing on content and bibliographic information; our proposed systemconsiders another important piece of information that is known by patent examiners; namely;applicant citations. We integrate applicant citations and bibliographic information of patentsinto a heterogeneous citation bibliographic network. Based on this network; we exploremetapaths based relationships between a query patent application and a candidate priorpatent and classify them into two categories:(1) Bibliographic meta-paths;(2) Applicant …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,1
Distributed entity resolution based on similarity join for large-scale data clustering,Tiezheng Nie; Wang-chien Lee; Derong Shen; Ge Yu; Yue Kou,Abstract Entity resolution has been widely used in data mining applications to find similarrecords. However; the increasing scale and complexity of data has restricted theperformance of entity resolution. In this paper; we propose a novel entity resolutionframework that clusters large-scale data with distributed entity resolution method. We modelthe clustering problem as finding similarity sub connected graphs from records. Firstly; ourapproach finds pairs of records whose similarities are above a given threshold based onappjoin algorithm which extends the ppjoin algorithm and are executed on MapReduceframework. Then; we propose a cache-based algorithm which cluster entities with similarpairs based on the Disjoin Set algorithm and are also designed for MapReduce framework.Experimental results on real dataset show that our algorithms can achieve more efficiency …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2014,1
Staffing Open Collaborative Projects Based on the Degree of Acquaintance,Mohammad Y Allaho; Wang-Chien Lee; De-Nian Yang,Abstract We consider the team formation problem in open collaborative projects existing inlarge community setting such as the Open Source Software (OSS) community. Given a queryspecifying a set of required skills for an open project and an upper bound of team size; thegoal is to find a team that maximizes the Degree of Acquaintance (DoA) and covers all therequired skills in the query. We define the DoA in terms of the team graph connectivity andedge weights; corresponding to the local Clustering Coefficient for each team member andthe strength of social ties between the team members; respectively. We perform a statisticalanalysis on historical data to show the importance of the connectivity and social tie strengthto the overall productivity of the teams in open projects.

On the semantic annotation of Wi-Fi SSID logs in mobile applications,Yao-Chung Fan; Chih-Wei Chang; Wang-Chien Lee; Kuo-Chen Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Research on mining data collected from smartphones has received tremendousinterests in the past few years. While significant research efforts have been made on miningvarious smartphone data; such as GPS trajectories; app usage logs; and acceleratorreadings; the issue of mining Wi-Fi SSID (Service Set IDentifier) logs was not well explored.The SSID of a Wi-Fi access point is normally a human-readable string; which is typicallynamed by the owner of the Wi-Fi network. Extracting and leveraging information encoded inSSIDs are crucial for a better understanding of the smartphone data. In this study; weinvestigate the problem of inferring location type of a given SSID; ie; associating an SSIDwith a location type; such as a workplace or a shop; where the Wi-Fi access point isinstalled.

A Comprehensive Study on Social Network Mental Disorders Detection via Online Social Media Mining,Hong-Han Shuai; Chih-Ya Shen; De-Nian Yang; Yi-Feng Lan; Wang-Chien Lee; Philip Yu; Ming-Syan Chen,With the explosive growth in popularity of social networking comes the problematic usage.An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs) have been recentlynoted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed passively today; resultingin delayed clinical intervention. In this paper; we argue that mining online social behaviorprovides an opportunity to actively identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging todetect SNMDs because the mental status cannot be directly observed from online socialactivity logs. Our approach; new and innovative to the practice of SNMD detection; does notrely on self-revealing of those mental factors via questionnaires in Psychology. Instead; wepropose a machine learning framework; namely; Social Network Mental Disorder Detection(SNMDD); that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately identify …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
BTCI: A new framework for identifying congestion cascades using bus trajectory data,Meng-Fen Chiang; Ee-Peng Lim; Wang-Chien Lee; Agus Trisnajaya Kwee,The knowledge of traffic health status is essential to the general public and urban trafficmanagement. To identify congestion cascades; an important phenomenon of traffic health;we propose a Bus Trajectory based Congestion Identification (BTCI) framework thatexplores the anomalous traffic health status and structure properties of congestion cascadesusing bus trajectory data. BTCI consists of two main steps; congested segment extractionand congestion cascades identification. The former constructs path speed models fromhistorical vehicle transitions and design a non-parametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)function to derive a measure of congestion score. The latter aggregates congestedsegments (ie; those with high congestion scores) into traffic congestion cascades by unifyingboth attribute coherence and spatio-temporal closeness of congested segments within a …,Big Data (Big Data); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Range-based Nearest Neighbor Queries with Complex-shaped Obstacles,Huaijie Zhu; Xiaochun Yang; Bin Wang; Wang-Chien Lee,In this paper; we study a novel variant of obstructed nearest neighbor queries; namely;range-based obstructed nearest neighbor (RONN) search. As a natural generalization ofcontinuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN); an RONN query retrieves a set ofobstructed nearest neighbors corresponding to every point in a specified range. We proposea new index; namely binary obstructed tree (called OB-tree); for indexing complex objects inthe obstructed space. The novelty of OB-tree lies in the idea of dividing the obstructed spaceinto non-obstructed subspaces; aiming to efficiently retrieve highly qualified candidates forRONN processing. We develop an algorithm for construction of the OB-tree and propose aspace division scheme; called optimal obstacle balance (OOB2) scheme; to address the treebalance problem. Accordingly; we propose an efficient algorithm; called RONN by OB …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Optimizing Word2Vec Performance on Multicore Systems,Vasudevan Rengasamy; Tao-Yang Fu; Wang-Chien Lee; Kamesh Madduri,Abstract The Skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS) method of Word2Vec is anunsupervised approach to map words in a text corpus to low dimensional real vectors. Thelearned vectors capture semantic relationships between co-occurring words and can beused as inputs to many natural language processing and machine learning tasks. There areseveral high-performance implementations of the Word2Vec SGNS method. In this paper;we introduce a new optimization called context combining to further boost SGNSperformance on multicore systems. For processing the One Billion Word benchmark dataseton a 16-core platform; we show that our approach is 3.53 x faster than the originalmultithreaded Word2Vec implementation and 1.28 x faster than a recent parallel Word2Vecimplementation.

Modeling Menu Bundle Designs of Crowdfunding Projects,Yusan Lin; Peifeng Yin; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Offering products in the forms of menu bundles is a common practice in marketingto attract customers and maximize revenues. In crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter;rewards also play an important part in influencing project success. Designing rewardsconsisting of the appropriate items is a challenging yet crucial task for the project creators.However; prior research has not considered the strategies project creators take to offer andbundle the rewards; making it hard to study the impact of reward designs on project success.In this paper; we raise a novel research question: understanding project creators' decisionsof reward designs to level their chance to succeed. We approach this by modeling thedesign behavior of project creators; and identifying the behaviors that lead to projectsuccess.

Newsfeed Screening for Behavioral Therapy to Social Network Mental Disorders.,Hong-Han Shuai; Yen-Chieh Lien; De-Nian Yang; Yi-Feng Lan; Wang-Chien Lee; S Yu Philip,ABSTRACT While the popularity of social network applications continues to grow; increasingcases of social network mental disorders (SNMDs) are also noted. For behavioral therapy ofSNMDs; an idea; similar to providing electronic cigare es to addictive smokers; is tosubstitute highly-addictive newsfeeds with safer; less-addictive ones to those users.Nevertheless; this idea faces two major challenges: 1) how to measure the addictive degreeof a newsfeed to an SNMD user; and 2) how to exploit the theories in Psychology todetermine appropriate substitution of newsfeeds for the therapy. To address these issues; inthis paper; we propose a learning framework; namely; SNMD-Aware PersonalizednEwsfeed Ranking (SAPER); that exploits features extracted from social network data tomeasure the addictive degree of a newsfeed.

Spatial-Proximity Optimization for Rapid Task Group Deployment,Chih-Ya Shen; De-Nian Yang; Wang-Chien Lee; Ming-Syan Chen,Abstract Spatial proximity is one of the most important factors for the quick deployment of thetask groups in various time-sensitive missions. This article proposes a new spatial query;Spatio-Social Team Query (SSTQ); that forms a strong task group by considering (1) thegroup's spatial distance (ie; transportation time);(2) skills of the candidate group members;and (3) social rapport among the candidates. Efficient processing of SSTQ is verychallenging; because the aforementioned spatial; skill; and social factors need to becarefully examined. In this article; therefore; we first formulate two subproblems of SSTQ;namely Hop-Constrained Team Problem (HCTP) and Connection-Oriented Team Query(COTQ). HCTP is a decision problem that considers only social and skill dimensions. Weprove that HCTP is NP-Complete. Moreover; based on the hardness of HCTP; we prove …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2016,*

By exploiting search space pruning; ROAD is very efficient and flexible for variousLDSQs on different types of objects over large-scale networks. In ROAD; a large roadnetwork is organized as a set of interconnected regional sub-networks (called Rnets)augmented with 1) shortcuts for accelerating search traversals; and 2) object abstracts forguiding object search.

Efficient Valid Scope for Location-Dependent Spatial Queries in Mobile Environments.(2010),Ken CK LEE; Wang-Chien LEE; Hong Va LEONG; Brandon Unger; Baihua ZHENG,Abstract—In mobile environments; mobile clients can access information with respect to theirlocations by submitting Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) to Location-BasedService (LBS) servers. Owing to scarce wireless channel bandwidth and limited clientbattery life; frequent LDSQ submission from clients must be avoided. Observing that LDSQsissued from a client located at nearby positions would likely return the same query results;we explore the idea of valid scope; which represents a spatial area in which a set of LDSQswill retrieve exactly the same set of query results. With a valid scope derived and an LDSQresult cached; a client can assert whether the new LDSQs can be answered with themaintained LDSQ result; thus eliminating the need of sending LDSQs to the server.Contention on the wireless channel and client energy consumed for data transmission …,Journal of Software,*,*
SAIU: An E cient Cache Replacement Policy for Wireless On-demand Broadcasts,Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract In a wireless communication environment; on-demand broadcasting is an attractiveinformation delivery method; while data caching is an important technique used to improvesystem performance. However; most of the wireless data caching techniques in the literaturewere designed for push-based broadcast systems. Due to varied item sizes; data updatesand frequent client disconnections; the design of client cache management in an on-demand broadcast system becomes a challenge. In this paper; we propose an e cient gain-based cache replacement policy; SAIU; for on-demand broadcasts. In SAIU; the in uence ofdata retrieval delays; data sizes; access probabilities and update frequencies is consideredtogether. Simulation-based performance evaluation shows the proposed policy substantiallyoutperforms the existing strategies.,*,*,*

eKTR: an Efficient Key Management Scheme in Wireless Data Broadcast Services,Qijun Gu; Peng Liu; Wang-Chien Lee; Chao-Hsien Chu,Abstract Wireless broadcast is an effective approach to disseminate data to a number ofusers. To provide secure access to the broadcast data; key-based encryption is used toensure that only users who own the valid keys can decrypt the data. Regarding varioussubscriptions; an efficient key management to distribute and change keys is in great demandin the broadcast system. In this paper; we propose an efficient key management scheme;eKTR; to address this issue. eKTR lets multiple programs share a single key tree so that theusers subscribing these programs can hold less keys. In eKTR; we also propose anapproach to further reduce rekey cost by identifying the minimum set of keys that must bechanged to ensure broadcast security. Our simulations show that eKTR can save about 45%of communication overhead in the broadcast channel and about 50% of decryption cost …,*,*,*
