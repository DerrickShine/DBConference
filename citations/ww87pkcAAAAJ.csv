A stochastic model of TCP/IP with stationary random losses,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat,Abstract We present a technique for identifying repetitive information transfers and use it toanalyze the redundancy of network traffic. Our insight is that dynamic content; streamingmedia and other traffic that is not caught by today's Web caches is nonetheless likely toderive from similar information. We have therefore adapted similarity detection techniques tothe problem of designing a system to eliminate redundant transfers. We identify repeatedbyte ranges between packets to avoid retransmitting the redundant data.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2000,342
On TCP performance in a heterogeneous network: a survey,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman; Walid Dabbous,Transmission media carrying Internet traffic present a wide range of characteristics; some ofwhich; such as transmission errors; long end-to-end delay; and bandwidth asymmetry; maycause a degradation of the TCP performance. Many works have studied the performance ofTCP over these media; most of which focus on a particular network type. In this work westudy TCP performance independent of the type of network by considering the differentpossible characteristics of the connection path. We present the problems and the differentproposed solutions. This study permits us to understand the limitations of the actualsolutions and the required modifications to let TCP cope with a heterogeneous Internet onan end-to-end basis.,Communications Magazine; IEEE,2000,300
Optimal buffer management policies for delay tolerant networks,Amir Krifa; Chadi Barakat; Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos,Delay Tolerant Networks are wireless networks where disconnections may occur frequentlydue to propagation phenomena; node mobility; and power outages. Propagation delays mayalso be long due to the operational environment (eg deep space; underwater). In order toachieve data delivery in such challenging networking environments; researchers haveproposed the use of store-carry-and-forward protocols: there; a node may store a messagein its buffer and carry it along for long periods of time; until an appropriate forwardingopportunity arises. Additionally; multiple message replicas are often propagated to increasedelivery probability. This combination of long-term storage and replication imposes a highstorage overhead on untethered nodes (eg handhelds). Thus; efficient buffer managementpolicies are necessary to decide which messages should be discarded; when node …,Sensor; Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks; 2008.

Network characteristics of video streaming traffic,Ashwin Rao; Arnaud Legout; Yeon-sup Lim; Don Towsley; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,Abstract Video streaming represents a large fraction of Internet traffic. Surprisingly; little isknown about the network characteristics of this traffic. In this paper; we study the networkcharacteristics of the two most popular video streaming services; Netflix and YouTube. Weshow that the streaming strategies vary with the type of the application (Web browser ornative mobile application); and the type of container (Silverlight; Flash; or HTML5) used forvideo streaming. In particular; we identify three different streaming strategies that producetraffic patterns from non-ack clocked ON-OFF cycles to bulk TCP transfer. We then presentan analytical model to study the potential impact of these streaming strategies on theaggregate traffic and make recommendations accordingly.,Proceedings of the Seventh COnference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies,2011,272
Performance analysis under finite load and improvements for multirate 802.11,Gion Reto Cantieni; Qiang Ni; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,Abstract Automatic rate adaptation in Carrier Sense Multiple Access with CollisionAvoidance (CSMA/CA) wireless networks may cause drastic throughput degradation for high-speed bit rate stations (STAs). The CSMA/CA medium access method guarantees equallong-term channel access probability to all hosts when they are saturated. In previous work ithas been shown that the saturation throughput of any STA is limited by the saturationthroughput of the STA with the lowest bit rate in the same infrastructure. In order to overcomethis problem; we first introduce in this article a new model for finite load sources withmultirate capabilities. We use our model to investigate the throughput degradation outsideand inside the saturation regime. We define a new fairness index based on the channeloccupation time to have more suitable definition of fairness in multirate environments …,Computer Communications,2005,216
Modeling and analysis of slow CW decrease IEEE 802.11 WLAN,Qiang Ni; Imad Aad; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,The IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocol provides a contention-baseddistributed channel access mechanism for mobile stations to share the wireless medium;which may introduce a lot of collisions in case of overloaded active stations. Slow contentionwindow (CW) decrease scheme is a simple and efficient solution for this problem. In thispaper; we use an analytical model to compare the slow CW decrease scheme to the IEEE802.11 MAC protocol. Several parameters are investigated such as the number of stations;the initial CW size; the decrease factor value; the maximum backoff stage and thecoexistence with the RequestToSend and ClearToSend (RTS/CTS) mechanism. The resultsshow that the slow CW decrease scheme can efficiently improve the throughput of IEEE802.11; and that the throughput gain is higher when the decrease factor is larger …,Personal; Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications; 2003.

Modeling Internet backbone traffic at the flow level,Chadi Barakat; Patrick Thiran; Gianluca Iannaccone; Christophe Diot; Philippe Owezarski,Our goal is to design a traffic model for noncongested Internet backbone links; which issimple enough to be used in network operation; while being as general as possible. Theproposed solution is to model the traffic at the flow level by a Poisson shot-noise process. Inour model; a flow is a generic notion that must be able to capture the characteristics of anykind of data stream. We analyze the accuracy of the model with real traffic traces collectedon the Sprint Internet protocol (IP) backbone network. Despite its simplicity; our modelprovides a good approximation of the real traffic observed in the backbone and of itsvariation. Finally; we discuss the application of our model to network design anddimensioning.,IEEE Transactions on Signal processing,2003,157
Adaptive fair channel allocation for QoS enhancement in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs,Mohammad Malli; Qiang Ni; Thierry Turletti; Chadi Barakat,The emerging widespread use of real-time multimedia applications over wireless networksmakes the support of quality of service (QoS) a key problem. In this paper; we focus on QoSsupport mechanisms for IEEE 802.11 wireless ad-hoc networks. First; we review limitationsof the upcoming IEEE 802.11 e enhanced DCF (EDCF) and other enhanced MAC schemesthat have been proposed to support QoS for 802.11 ad-hoc networks. Then; we describe anew scheme called adaptive fair EDCF that extends EDCF; by increasing the contentionwindow during deferring periods when the channel is busy; and by using an adaptive fastbackoff mechanism when the channel is idle. Our scheme computes an adaptive backoffthreshold for each priority level by taking into account the channel load. The new schemesignificantly improves the quality of multimedia applications.

Bandwidth tradeoff between TCP and link-level FEC,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Abstract Forward error correction (FEC) is widely used for the improvement of the quality ofnoisy transmission media as wireless links. This improvement is of importance for a transportprotocol as TCP which uses the loss of packets as an indication of network congestion. FECshields TCP from losses not caused by congestion and helps it to improve its throughput buton the other hand it consumes a part of the available bandwidth that could be used by TCP.In this paper we study in detail this bandwidth tradeoff between TCP and FEC. By analysisand simulations we show how TCP performance varies as a function of the amount of FEC.,Computer Networks,2002,142

A stochastic model of TCP/IP with stationary random losses,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat,Abstract In this paper; we present a model for TCP/IP congestion control mechanism. Therate at which data is transmitted increases linearly in time until a packet loss is detected. Atthis point; the transmission rate is divided by a constant factor. Losses are generated bysome exogenous random process which is assumed to be stationary ergodic. This allows usto account for any correlation and any distribution of inter-loss times. We obtain an explicitexpression for the throughput of a TCP connection and bounds on the throughput whenthere is a limit on the window size. In addition; we study the effect of the Timeout mechanismon the throughput. A set of experiments is conducted over the real Internet and a comparisonis provided with other models that make simple assumptions on the inter-loss time process.The comparison shows that our model approximates well the throughput of TCP for many …,Networking; IEEE/ACM Transactions on,2005,115
Reformulating the monitor placement problem: Optimal network-wide sampling,Gion Reto Cantieni; Gianluca Iannaccone; Chadi Barakat; Christophe Diot; Patrick Thiran,Abstract Confronted with the generalization of monitoring in operational networks;researchers have proposed placement algorithms that can help ISPs deploy their monitoringinfrastructure in a cost effective way; while maximizing the benefits of their infrastructure.However; a static placement of monitors cannot be optimal given the short-term and long-term variations in traffic due to re-routing events; anomalies and the normal networkevolution. In addition; most ISPs already deploy router embedded monitoring functionalities.Despite some limitations (inherent to being part of a router); these monitoring tools givegreater visibility on the network traffic but raise the question on how to configure a network-wide monitoring infrastructure that may contain hundreds of monitoring points.

Network coding for wireless mesh networks: A case study,Anwar Al Hamra; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,Abstract Network coding is a new transmission paradigm that proved its strength inoptimizing the usage of network resources. In this paper; we evaluate the gain from usingnetwork coding for file sharing applications running on top of wireless mesh networks. Withextensive simulations carried out on a simulator we developed specifically for this study; weconfirm that network coding can improve the performance of the file sharing application; butnot as in wired networks. The main reason is that nodes over wireless cannot listen todifferent neighbors simultaneously. Nevertheless; one can get more from network coding ifthe information transmission is made more diverse inside the network. We support thisargument by varying the loss rate over wireless links and adding more sources.,Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on on World of Wireless; Mobile and Multimedia Networks,2006,112
TCP in presence of bursty losses,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat,Abstract In this paper we analyze the performance of a TCP-like flow control mechanism in alossy environment. The transmission rate in the control scheme that we consider has a lineargrowth rate; whenever a loss occurs; the transmission rate is halved. This approximates theperformance of several versions of TCP that divide their congestion window by two when aloss is detected. We propose a mathematical model that allows to account for burstiness inthe loss process. We compute the expected transmission rate and its moments at somepotential loss instants; and provide useful implicit and explicit expressions for the LaplaceStieltjes transform. This allows us to compute explicitly the time average of the transmissionrate as well as its moments. We show that the time average of the transmission rate isindeed sensitive to the distribution of losses; and not just to the average loss rate: for a …,Performance Evaluation,2000,112
Enhancing IEEE 802.11 MAC in congested environments,Imad Aad; Qiang Ni; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,Abstract IEEE 802.11 is currently the most deployed wireless local area networkingstandard. It uses carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) toresolve contention between nodes. Contention windows (CW) change dynamically to adaptto the contention level: Upon each collision; a node doubles its CW to reduce furthercollision risks. Upon a successful transmission; the CW is reset; assuming that thecontention level has dropped. However; the contention level is more likely to change slowly;and resetting the CW causes new collisions and retransmissions before the CW reaches theoptimal value again. This wastes bandwidth and increases delays. In this paper we analyzesimple slow CW decrease functions and compare their performances to the legacy standard.We use simulations and mathematical modeling to show their considerable …,Computer communications,2005,103
Queueing analysis of simple FEC schemes for IP telephony,Eitan Altman; Chadi Barakat; Victor M Ramos,In interactive voice applications; FEC schemes are necessary for the recovery from packetlosses. These schemes need to be simple with a light coding and decoding overhead inorder to not impact the interactivity. The objective of this paper is to study a well knownsimple FEC scheme; in which for every packet n; some redundant information is added insome subsequent packet n+/spl phi/. If packet n is lost; it will be reconstructed in case packetn+/spl phi/is well received. The quality of the reconstructed copy of packet n will depend onthe amount of information on packet n we add to packet n+/spl phi/. We propose a detailedqueueing analysis based on a ballot theorem and obtain simple expressions for the audioquality as a function of the amount of redundancy and its relative position to the originalinformation. The analysis shows that this FEC scheme does not scale well and that the …,INFOCOM 2001. Twentieth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. Proceedings. IEEE,2001,91
An optimal joint scheduling and drop policy for delay tolerant networks,Amir Krifa; Chadi Barakat; Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos,Delay tolerant networks (DTN) are wireless networks where disconnections may occurfrequently. In order to achieve data delivery in DTNs; researchers have proposed the use ofstore-carry-and-forward protocols: there; a node may store a message in its buffer and carryit along for long periods of time; until an appropriate forwarding opportunity arises. Multiplemessage replicas are often propagated to increase delivery probability. This combination oflong-term storage and replication imposes a high storage and bandwidth overhead.

State-dependent M/G/1 type queueing analysis for congestion control in data networks,Eitan Altman; Kostya Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat; Rudesindo Núñez-Queija,Abstract We study a linear-increase multiplicative-decrease flow control mechanism. Weconsider congestion signals that arrive in batches according to a Poisson process. We focuson the case when the transmission rate cannot exceed a certain maximum value. Thedistribution of the transmission rate in steady state as well as its moments are determined.Our model is particularly useful to study the behavior of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)the congestion control mechanism in the Internet. Burstiness of packet losses is captured byallowing congestion signals to arrive in batches. By a simple transformation; the problemcan be reformulated in terms of an equivalent M/G/1 queue; where the transmission rate inthe original model corresponds to the workload in thedual'queue. The service times in thequeueing model are not iid; and they depend on the workload in the system.,Computer Networks,2002,73
TCP/IP modeling and validation,Chadi Barakat,We discuss the different issues to be considered when modeling the TCP protocol in a realenvironment. The discussion is based on measurements we made over the Internet.

Fairness analysis of TCP/IP,Eitan Altman; Chadi Barakat; Emmanuel Laborde; Patrick Brown; Denis Collange,Bandwidth sharing between multiple TCP connections has been studied under theassumption that the windows of the different connections vary in a synchronized manner.This synchronization is a main result of the deployment of drop tail buffers in network routers.The deployment of active queue management techniques such as random early detection(RED) will alleviate this problem of synchronization. We develop in this paper amathematical model to study how the bottleneck bandwidth will be shared if TCP windowsare not synchronized. This permits to evaluate the improvement in fairness and utilizationbrought by the deployment of active buffers. Also; this indicates how much a synchronization-based study underestimates the performance of TCP in a nonsynchronized environment.,Decision and Control; 2000.

Analysis of link-level hybrid FEC/ARQ-SR for wireless links and long-lived TCP traffic,Chadi Barakat; Alaeddine Al Fawal,Abstract Since the TCP protocol uses the loss of packets as an indication of networkcongestion; its performance degrades over wireless links; which are characterized by a highbit error rate. Different solutions have been proposed to improve the performance of TCPover wireless links; the most promising one being the use of a hybrid model at the link levelcombining Forward Error Correction (FEC); Automatic Repeat Request with SelectiveRepeat (ARQ-SR); and an in-order delivery of packets to IP. The drawback of FEC is that itconsumes some extra bandwidth to transmit the redundant information. ARQ-SR consumesextra bandwidth only when packets are lost; its drawback is that it increases the round-triptime (RTT); which may deteriorate the performance of TCP. Another drawback of ARQ-SR isthat a complete packet can be retransmitted to correct a small piece of errored data. We …,Performance Evaluation,2004,59
TCP network calculus: The case of large delay-bandwidth product,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat,We present an analytical model for the calculation of network load and drop probabilities ina TCP/IP network with general topology. First we formulate our model as a nonlinearcomplementarity problem. Then we transform the model into two equivalent formulations:fixed point formulation and nonlinear programming formulation. These equivalentformulations provide efficient computational procedures for the solution of our model.Furthermore; with the help of the fixed point formulation we are able to prove the existence ofa solution. Our model has the main advantage of not requiring the pre-definition ofbottleneck links. The model also takes into account the receiver congestion windowlimitation. Our approach can be used for TCP/IP networks with drop tail buggers as well asfor TCP/IP networks with active queue management buggers. We solve the problem for …,INFOCOM 2002.

Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 MAC and physical layer protocol,Mohammad Hossein Manshaei; Gion Reto Cantieni; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,We present an analytical model that accounts for the positions of stations with respect to theaccess point (AP) while evaluating the performance of the 802.11 MAC layer. Our work isbased on the Bianchi model where the performance of the 802.11 MAC layer is computedusing a discrete time Markov chain; but where all stations are implicitly assumed to belocated at the same distance from the AP. In our model; given the position of one station; wecompute its saturation throughput while considering the positions of other concurrentstations. Further; our model provides the total saturation throughput of the medium. We solvethe model numerically and we show that the saturation throughput per station is stronglydependent not only on the station's position; but also on the positions of the other stations.Results confirm that a station achieves a higher throughput when it is closer to the AP; but …,World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks; 2005.

Understanding the properties of the bittorrent overlay,Anwar Al Hamra; Arnaud Legout; Chadi Barakat,Abstract: In this paper; we conduct extensive simulations to understand the properties of theoverlay generated by BitTorrent. We start by analyzing how the overlay properties impact theefficiency of BitTorrent. We focus on the average peer set size (ie; average number ofneighbors); the time for a peer to reach its maximum peer set size; and the diameter of theoverlay. In particular; we show that the later a peer arrives in a torrent; the longer it takes toreach its maximum peer set size. Then; we evaluate the impact of the maximum peer setsize; the maximum number of outgoing connections per peer; and the number of NATedpeers on the overlay properties. We show that BitTorrent generates a robust overlay; but thatthis overlay is not a random graph. In particular; the connectivity of a peer to its neighborsdepends on its arriving order in the torrent. We also show that a large number of NATed …,Arxiv preprint arXiv:0707.1820,2007,50
Ranking flows from sampled traffic,Chadi Barakat; Gianluca Iannaccone; Christophe Diot,Abstract Most of the theoretical work on sampling has addressed the inversion of generaltraffic properties such as flow size distribution; average flow size; or total number of flows. Inthis paper; we make a step towards understanding the impact of packet sampling onindividual flow properties. We study how to detect and rank the largest flows on a link. To thisend; we develop an analytical model that we validate on real traces from two networks. Firstwe study a blind ranking method where only the number of sampled packets from each flowis known. Then; we propose a new method; protocol-aware ranking; where we make use ofthe packet sequence number (when available in transport header) to infer the number of non-sampled packets from a flow; and hence to improve the ranking.

Analysis of AIMD protocols over paths with variable delay,Eitan Altman; Chadi Barakat; Víctor M Ramos R,Abstract The throughput of AIMD protocols in general and of TCP in particular; has beencomputed in many existing works by modeling the round-trip time as a constant and thusreplacing it by its expectation. There are however many scenarios in which the delays ofpackets vary; causing a variation of the round-trip time. Many typical scenarios occur inwireless and mobile networks. We propose in this paper an analytical model that accountsfor the variability of delay; while computing the throughput of an AIMD protocol. We derive aclosed-form expression for the throughput; that illustrates the impact of delay variability. Weshow by analysis and simulation; that an increase in the variability of delay improves theperformance of an AIMD protocol. Thus; an analytical model that only considers the averagedelay could underestimate the performance of an AIMD protocol in scenarios where delay …,Computer Networks,2005,38
Optimizing rules placement in OpenFlow networks: trading routing for better efficiency,Xuan Nam Nguyen; Damien Saucez; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,Abstract The idea behind Software Defined Networking (SDN) is to conceive the network asone programmable entity rather than a set of devices to manually configure; and OpenFlowmeets this objective. In OpenFlow; a centralized programmable controller installs rules ontoswitches to implement policies. However; this flexibility comes at the expense of extraoverhead as the number of rules might exceed the memory capacity of switches; whichraises the question of how to place most profitable rules on board. Solutions proposed so farstrictly impose paths to be followed inside the network. We advocate instead that we cantrade routing requirements within the network to concentrate on where to forward traffic; nothow to do it. As an illustration of the concept; we propose an optimization problem that getsthe maximum amount of traffic delivered according to policies and the actual …,ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Defined Networking (HotSDN 2014),2014,37
MobiTrade: trading content in disruption tolerant networks,Amir Krifa; Chadi Barakat; Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos,Abstract In this paper; we present MobiTrade; a utility driven trading system for efficientcontent dissemination on top of a disruption tolerant network. While simple tit-for-tat (TFT)mechanisms can force nodes to" give one to get one"; dealing with the inherent tendency ofpeers to take much but give back little; they can quickly lead to deadlocks when some (ormost) of interesting content must be somehow fetched across the network. To resolve this;MobiTrade proposes a trading mechanism that allows a node (" merchant") to buy; store;and carry content for other nodes (its" clients") so that it can later trade it for content it ispersonally interested in. To exploit this extra degree of freedom; MobiTrade nodescontinuously profile the type of content requested and the collaboration level of encountereddevices.

Performance of short TCP transfers,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Abstract Many works have studied the negative impact of slow start on the performance ofshort transfers. Some works propose to accelerate the window increase during this phase inorder to improve the performance especially on satellite links. Others propose to set the slowstart threshold at the beginning of the connection to a more accurate value in order to avoidlosses. But; these works didn't account for the impact of network buffers on the performance.It is known that small buffers along with a fast window increase leads to an early bufferoverflow and an underestimation of the network capacity. This may change completely theperformance predicted by these modifications. In this paper; we present a general analysisof this first phase as a function of all the possible parameters. We show that; as claimed; theprevious works improve the performance on paths with large buffers. However; on paths …,International Conference on Research in Networking,2000,35
Adapting BitTorrent to wireless ad hoc networks,Mohamed Sbai; Chadi Barakat; Jaeyoung Choi; Anwar Hamra; Thierry Turletti,Abstract BitTorrent is one of the Internet's most efficient content distribution protocols. It isknown to perform very well over the wired Internet where end-to-end performance is almostguaranteed. However; in wireless ad hoc networks; many constraints appear as the scarcityof resources and their shared nature; which make running BitTorrent with its defaultconfiguration not lead to best performances. To these constraints it adds the fact that peersare both routers and end-users and that TCP-performance drops seriously with the numberof hops. We show in this work that the neighbor selection mechanism in BitTorrent plays animportant role in determining the performance of the protocol when deployed over a wirelessad hoc network. It is no longer efficient to choose and treat with peers independently of theirlocation. A first solution is to limit the scope of the neighborhood. In this case; TCP …,Ad-hoc; Mobile and Wireless Networks,2008,32
Can we trust the inter-packet time for traffic classification?,Mohamad Jaber; Roberto G Cascella; Chadi Barakat,The identification of Internet applications is important for ISPs and network administrators toprotect the network from unwanted traffic and prioritize some major applications. Statisticalmethods are widely used since they allow to classify applications according to theirstatistical signatures. They combine the statistical analysis of flow parameters; such aspacket size and inter-packet time; with machine learning techniques. Previous works aremainly based on the packet size and the directions of the packets. In this work we make acomplete study about the inter-packet time to prove that it is also a valuable information forthe classification of Internet traffic. We discuss how to isolate the noise due to the networkconditions and extract the time generated by the application.

Improving TCP/IP over geostationary satellite links,Chadi Barakat; Nesrine Chaher; Walid Dabbous; Eitan Altman,We focus in this paper on the undesirable phenomenon of early buffer overflow during slowstart (SS) when TCP operates in large bandwidth-delay product networks such as thoseincluding geostationary satellite links. This phenomenon; already identified by Altman; Bolot;Nain; Elouadghiri; Erramdani; Brown and Collange (1995) and by Lakshman and Madhow(see IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking; 1997) is caused by the bursty type of TCPtraffic during SS. It results in an underestimation of the available bandwidth and adegradation in TCP throughput. Given the high cost and the scarcity of satellite links; it is ofimportance to find solutions to this problem. We propose two simple modifications to TCPalgorithms and illustrate their effectiveness via mathematical analysis and simulations. First;we reduce the SS threshold in order to get in congestion avoidance before buffer overflow …,Global Telecommunications Conference; 1999. GLOBECOM'99,1999,26
Officer: A general optimization framework for openflow rule allocation and endpoint policy enforcement,Xuan-Nam Nguyen; Damien Saucez; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,The Software-Defined Networking approach permits to realize new policies. In OpenFlow inparticular; a controller decides on behalf of the switches which forwarding rules must beinstalled and where. However with this flexibility comes the challenge of the computation ofa rule allocation matrix meeting both high-level policies and the network constraints such asmemory or link capacity limitations. Nevertheless; in many situations (eg; data-centernetworks); the exact path followed by packets does not severely impact performances aslong as packets are delivered according to the endpoint policy. It is thus possible to deviatepart of the traffic to alternative paths so to better use network resources without violating theendpoint policy. In this paper; we propose a linear optimization model of the rule allocationproblem in resource constrained OpenFlow networks with relaxing routing policy.

Performance analysis of AIMD mechanisms over a multi-state Markovian path,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat; Parijat Dube,Abstract We analyze the performance of an Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease(AIMD)-like flow control mechanism. The transmission rate is considered to increase linearlyin time until the receipt of a congestion notification; when the transmission rate ismultiplicatively decreased. AIMD captures the steady state behavior of TCP in the absenceof timeouts and in the absence of maximum window size limitation. We introduce a generalfluid model based on a multi-state Markov chain for the moments at which the congestion isdetected. With this model; we are able to account for correlation and burstiness incongestion moments. Furthermore; we specify several simple versions of our general modeland then we identify their parameters from real TCP traces.,Computer Networks,2005,25
On the utility of FEC mechanisms for audio applications,Eitan Altman; Chadi Barakat; Víctor Ramos R,Abstract FEC mechanisms have been proposed to recover from packet losses; and hence toimprove the perceived quality in audio applications. Recently; it has been shown in [1] thatthe redundancy added by a FEC scheme increases the congestion of the network anddeteriorates the audio quality instead of improving it. In this work we show via a simplequeuing analysis that the impact of FEC on the audio quality is not always negative and thatwe can get better quality in some scenarios. In particular; we show that FEC is beneficialwhen a small number of flows implement it or when the audio applications have someparticular utility functions. We derive conditions on when to get a gain in quality as well asbounds on the maximum gain that we can obtain.,Quality of Future Internet Services,2001,24
Rules placement problem in openflow networks: a survey,Xuan-Nam Nguyen; Damien Saucez; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,Software-defined networking (SDN) abstracts low-level network functionalities to simplifynetwork management and reduce costs. The OpenFlow protocol implements the SDNconcept by abstracting network communications as flows to be processed by networkelements. In OpenFlow; the high-level policies are translated into network primitives calledrules that are distributed over the network. While the abstraction offered by OpenFlow allowsto potentially implement any policy; it raises the new question of how to define the rules andwhere to place them in the network while respecting all technical and administrativerequirements. In this paper; we propose a comprehensive study of the so-called OpenFlowrules placement problem with a survey of the various proposals intending to solve it. Ourstudy is multifold. First; we define the problem and its challenges. Second; we overview …,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,2016,23

Minimizing bandwidth on peering links with deflection in named data networking,Chadi Barakat; Anshuman Kalla; Damien Saucez; Thierry Turletti,Content dissemination is the primary usage of the Internet today; whereas the existingInternet architecture based on TCP/IP is mainly designed for point-to-point communications.Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed to conciliate Internet usage andtechnology. The idea behind ICN is to omit the notion of host and location and establishcontent as the first class citizen of the network. ICN advocates in-network caching; ie; tocache content on the path from content providers to requesters. This on-path cachingachieves good overall performance but is not optimal as content may be replicated onrouters so reducing the total volume of content that can be cached. To overcome thislimitation; we introduce the notion of off-path caching where we allocate content to welldefined off-path caches within the network and deflect the traffic off the optimal path …,Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT); 2013 Third International Conference on,2013,22
AIMD and CCN: past and novel acronyms working together in the Future Internet,Damien Saucez; Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Content-centric networking (CCN) is a new paradigm to better handle contents inthe future Internet. Under the assumption that CCN networks will deploy a similar congestioncontrol mechanism than in today's TCP/IP (ie; AIMD); we can build an analytical model of thebandwidth sharing in CCN based on the" square-root formula of TCP'". With this model wecompare CCN download performance to what users get today. We consider different factorssuch as the way CCN routers are deployed; the popularity of contents; or the capacity oflinks and observe that when AIMD is used in a CCN network less popular contentthroughput is massively penalized whilst the individual gain for popular content is negligible.Finally; the main advantage of using CCN is the decrease of load at the server side. Ourobservations advocate the necessity to clearly define the notion of fairness in CCN and to …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM workshop on Capacity sharing,2012,22
Swarming overlay construction strategies,Anwar Al-Hamra; Nikitas Liogkas; Arnaud Legout; Chadi Barakat,Swarming peer-to-peer systems play an increasingly instrumental role in Internet contentdistribution. It is therefore important to better understand how these systems behave inpractice. Recent research efforts have looked at various protocol parameters and havemeasured how they affect system performance and robustness. However; the importance ofthe strategy based on which peers establish connections has been largely overlooked. Thiswork utilizes extensive simulations to examine the default overlay construction strategy inBitTorrent systems. Based on the results; we identify a critical parameter; the maximumallowable number of outgoing connections at each peer; and evaluate its impact on therobustness of the generated overlay. We find that there is no single optimal value for thisparameter using the default strategy. We then propose an alternative strategy that allows …,Computer Communications and Networks; 2009.

Controlled use of excess backbone bandwidth for providing new services in IP-over-WDM networks,Antonio Nucci; Nina Taft; Chadi Barakat; Patrick Thiran,We study an approach to quality-of-service (QoS) that offers end-users the choice betweentwo service classes defined according to their level of transmission protection. The fullyprotected (FP) class offers end-users a guarantee of survivability in the case of a single-linkfailure; all FP traffic is protected using a 1: 1 protection scheme at the wavelength-divisionmultiplexing (WDM) layer. The best effort protected (BEP) class is not protected; insteadrestoration at the IP layer is provided. The FP service class mimics what Internet usersreceive today. The BEP traffic is designed to run over the large amounts of unusedbandwidth that exist in today's Internet. The goal is to increase the load carried on backbonenetworks without reducing the QoS received by existing customers. To support two suchservices; we have to solve two problems: the off-line problem of mapping logical links to …,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2004,22
Analysis of TCP latency over wireless links supporting FEC/ARQ-SR for error recovery,Raja Abdelmoumen; Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat,We study in this paper the performance of TCP over a wireless link implementing hybridFEC/ARQ-SR at the link layer. The study is done by simulating a large number of TCPtransfers over a wireless link showing Bernoulli errors. We are motivated by how to tune link-level error recovery; eg amount of FEC; persistency of ARQ; so as to minimize the latency ofTCP. We provide results for different physical characteristics of the wireless link (delay; errorrate); different traffic loads and different file sizes. Our main finding is that the latency of TCPalways improves with the persistency of ARQ; except for some extreme cases where thedelay is large; files are small; and the loss rate is low. When adding FEC; the latency of TCPimproves then deteriorates; and the deterioration is more pronounced in the case of largefiles; high loss rate and small delay. Another finding of our study is that with the hybrid …,Communications; 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,22
TCP modeling in the presence of nonlinear window growth,Eitan Altman; Kostia Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat; Rudesindo Núnez-Queija,We develop a model for TCP that accounts for both sublinearity and limitation of windowgrowth. Sublinear window growth is observed when the round-trip time of the connectionincreases with the window size. Limitation is due to the window advertised by the receiver.First; we derive the conditions for the stability of the model. Then; we write the Kolmogorovequation under Markovian assumptions. The model is solved analytically for some particularcases. A good match between the throughput predicted by the model and the throughputmeasured on real TCP connections is reported at the end.,Teletraffic Science and Engineering,2001,22
A markovian model for TCP analysis in a differentiated services network,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Abstract In a Differentiated Services network; the use of TCP by an application impacts theservice it gets from the network. TCP congestion control algorithms are designed to providea fair sharing of resources in a best effort network as the current Internet. TCP is notconscious of the new services proposed by DiffServ; namely the different priorities packetsare injected with into the network. Many schemes have been proposed to support TCP trafficin a DiffServ network. These schemes have been often validated with simulations. In thispaper we propose an analytical model to study the performance of TCP in a DiffServ networkunder the different proposed schemes. The model is based on a Markovian fluid approach.We present first a general version of the model; then we specify it to the different proposedschemes. For each scheme; we compute the throughput achieved by a TCP connection …,Telecommunication Systems,2004,20
P2P content sharing in spontaneous multi-hop wireless networks,Mohamed Karim Sbai; Emna Salhi; Chadi Barakat,Spontaneous multi-hop wireless networks provide a new environment for sharing contentamong communities of end users. Nodes interested in some content can share it on a multi-hop basis by relying on the collaboration of intermediate nodes. Organizing thecommunication overlay in such an environment is then a challenging task especially giventhe mobility of the nodes; the interference; and the scarcity of resources. In this work; wepropose and implement a general; stand-alone and efficient P2P content sharing protocolfor wireless ad hoc networks. We consider general and realistic scenarios ranging from asingle overlay to multiple overlays coexisting in the same network; and for every singleoverlay; we consider different peer densities in the network. The main challenges areoverlay disconnections; routing overhead; low sharing opportunities and instability of …,Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS); 2010 Second International Conference on,2010,19
Multilevel approach for modeling short TCP sessions,Urtzi Ayesta; KE Avrachenkov; E Altaman; Chadi Barakat; Parijat Dube,Abstract We model the TCP/IP network with non persistent sessions on three levels: Packetlevel; Session level and System level. On the packet level we characterization the packetarrival process at the bottleneck queue and we calculate the packet loss probability usingthe fixed point approach. In particular; we study by simulation under which conditions themultiplexed traffic is close to Poisson. On the session level; using the fluid model approachand conditioning on the number of loss instants; we calculate the average transfer time ofthe TCP flows as a function of the packet loss probability and the parameters of the TCPprotocol. We show that the expected latency conditioned on the fact that a packet has beenlost is not monotone with respect to the file size. Finally; on the system we apply the M/G/∞model to obtain the distribution of the number of active active sessions. All analytical …,Teletraffic Science and Engineering,2003,17
Analysis of MIMD congestion control algorithm for high speed networks,E Altman; K Avrachenkov; C Barakat; AA Kherani; BJ Prabhu,Abstract Proposals to improve the performance of TCP in high speed networks have beenrecently put forward. Examples of such proposals include High Speed TCP; Scalable TCP;and FAST. In contrast to the additive increase multiplicative decrease algorithm used in thestandard TCP; Scalable TCP uses a multiplicative increase multiplicative decrease (MIMD)algorithm for the window size evolution. In this paper; we present a mathematical analysis ofthe MIMD congestion control algorithm in the presence of random losses. Random lossesare typical to wireless networks but can also be used to model losses in wireline networkswith a high bandwidth-delay product. Our approach is based on showing that the logarithmof the window size evolution has the same behaviour as the workload process in a standardG/G/1 queue. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the equivalent queue is then shown to …,Computer Networks,2005,16
An efficient approach for content delivery in overlay networks,Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,The replication of digital content in overlay networks makes the identification of the bestserver an interesting problem. In this paper; our aim is to reduce the content transfer time;which we define as the time required to download a digital content by a client using TCP.Our scheme consists of ranking the servers from the best one to the worst one based on ametric that corresponds to a prediction of the content transfer time from each server. Ourprediction function considers the critical performance parameters that have an impact on thequality of the transfer; such as the load of the servers and the characteristics of the pathbetween the client and the servers. Once the servers are ranked; the client can downloadthe content on point-to-point from the best server; or in parallel from a subset of servers atthe top of the list (best servers). Our experimental results show that our approach for …,Second IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference; 2005. CCNC. 2005,2005,16
Estimating membership in a multicast session,Sara Alouf; Eitan Altman; Chadi Barakat; Philippe Nain,Abstract We propose two novel on-line estimation algorithms to determine the size of adynamic multicast group. We first use a Wiener filter to derive an optimal estimator for themembership size of the session in case the join process is Poisson and the lifetime ofparticipants is distributed exponentially. We next develop the best first-order linear filter fromwhich we derive an estimator that holds for any lifetime distribution. We apply this approachto the case where the lifetime distribution is hyperexponential. Both estimators hold underany traffic regime. Applying both estimators on real traces corresponding to video sessions;we find that both schemes behave well; one of which performs slightly better than the otherin some cases. We further provide guidelines on how to tune the parameters involved inboth schemes in order to achieve high quality estimation while simultaneously avoiding …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2003,16
Handling two-way TCP traffic in asymmetric networks,Fatma Louati; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,Abstract The TCP congestion control protocol is mainly designed for bandwidth symmetricpaths. As two-way asymmetric connections will probably become common case in the futurewith the widespread use of ADSL; satellites and other high-speed technologies; it isimportant to make sure that congestion will be properly handled in these environments. Tothis end; we propose in this paper a new Adaptive Class-based Queuing mechanism calledACQ for handling two-way TCP traffic over links that exhibit bandwidth asymmetry. ACQ runsat the entry of the slow link and relies on two separate classes; one for ACK packets and onefor Data packets. ACQ proposes to adapt the weights of both classes according to thecrossing traffic in order to maximize some utility function defined by the user or the networkoperator. We show by simulations that our mechanism is able to reach a good utilization …,High Speed Networks and Multimedia Communications,2004,15
Maximizing transfer opportunities in Bluetooth DTNs,Marc Liberatore; Brian Neil Levine; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Devices in disruption tolerant networks (DTNs) must be able to communicaterobustly in the face of short and infrequent connection opportunities. Unfortunately; one ofthe most inexpensive; energy-efficient and widely deployed peer-to-peer capable radios;Bluetooth; is not well-suited for use in a DTN. Bluetooth's half-duplex process of neighbordiscovery can take tens of seconds to complete between two mutually undiscovered radios.This delay can be larger than the time that mobile nodes can be expected to remain inrange; resulting in a missed opportunity and lower overall performance in a DTN. This paperproposes a simple; cost effective; and high performance modification to mobile nodes todramatically reduce this delay: the addition of a second Bluetooth radio. We showed throughanalysis and simulation that this dual radio technique improves both connection …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM CoNEXT conference,2006,14
A moving average predictor for playout delay control in VoIP,Víctor Ramos; Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Abstract Audio applications are now widely used in the Internet. Such applications requirereceiver playout buffers to smooth network delay variations and to reconstruct the periodicform of the transmitted packets. Packets arriving after their playout deadline are consideredlate and are not played out. Existing algorithms used in the Internet operate by adaptivelyadjusting the playout delay from talkspurt to talkspurt. There is an important tradeoff betweenloss percentage and average playout delay. Current algorithms fail to obtain a particular losspercentage. Controlling this parameter is a key characteristic for any playout adaptationalgorithm. This paper presents a Moving Average algorithm for playout delay adaptation withtunable loss percentage. We show with trace-based simulations that; in most of the cases;our algorithm performs better than those implemented in popular audio tools; and this is …,Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003,2003,14
From network-level measurements to expected Quality of Experience: the Skype use case,Thierry Spetebroot; Salim Afra; Nicolás Aguilera; Damien Saucez; Chadi Barakat,Modern Internet applications rely on rich multimedia contents making the quality ofexperience (QoE) of end users sensitive to network conditions. Several models weredeveloped in the literature to express QoE as a function of measurements carried out on thetraffic of the applications themselves. In this paper; we propose a new methodology basedon machine learning able to link expected QoE to network and device level measurementsoutside the applications' traffic. This direct linking to network and device level measurementsis important for the prediction of QoE. We prove the feasibility of the approach in the contextof Skype. In particular; we derive and validate a model to predict the Skype QoE as afunction of easily measurable network performance metrics. One can see our methodologyas a new way of performing measurements in the Internet; where instead of expressing …,Measurements & Networking (M&N); 2015 IEEE International Workshop on,2015,13
Using host profiling to refine statistical application identification,Mohamad Jaber; Roberto G Cascella; Chadi Barakat,The identification of Internet traffic applications is very important for ISPs and networkadministrators to protect their resources from unwanted traffic and prioritize some majorapplications. Statistical methods are preferred to port-based ones since they don't rely on theport number; which can change dynamically; and to deep packet inspection since they alsowork for encrypted traffic. These methods combine the statistical analysis of the applicationpacket flow parameters; such as packet size and inter-packet time; with machine learningtechniques. Other successful approaches rely on the way the hosts communicate and theirtraffic patterns to identify applications. In this paper; we propose a new online method fortraffic classification that combines the statistical and host-based approaches in order toconstruct a robust and precise method for early Internet traffic identification.

Optimal estimation of multicast membership,Sara Alouf; Eitan Altman; Chadi Barakat; Philippe Nain,This paper addresses optimal online estimation of the size of a multicast group. Threedistinct approaches are used. The first one builds on Kalman filter theory to derive the MSE-optimal estimator in a heavy-traffic regime. Under more general assumptions; the secondapproach uses Wiener filter theory to compute the MSE-optimal linear filter. The thirdapproach develops the best first-order linear filter from which an estimator that holds for anyon-time distribution is derived. Our estimators are tested on real video traces and exhibitgood performance. The paper also provides guidelines on how to tune the parametersinvolved in the schemes in order to achieve high-quality estimation while simultaneouslyavoiding feedback implosion.,Signal Processing; IEEE Transactions on,2003,13
Analysis of TCP with several bottleneck nodes,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Many works have studied the performance of TCP by modeling the network as a singlebottleneck node. We present a more general model taking into account all the nodes on thepath not only the main bottleneck. We show that; in addition to the main bottleneck; the othernodes can seriously affect the performance of TCP. They may cause an improvement in theperformance by decreasing the burstiness of TCP traffic arriving at the main bottleneck. But;if the buffers in these nodes are not well dimensioned; the congestion may be shifted to themwhich deteriorates the performance even though they are faster than the main bottleneck.We conclude our analysis by guidelines for the dimensioning of network buffers so as toimprove the performance of TCP.,Global Telecommunications Conference; 1999.

An analysis of packet sampling in the frequency domain,Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Packet sampling techniques introduce measurement errors that should be carefullyhandled in order to correctly characterize the network behavior. In the literature severalworks have studied the statistical properties of packet sampling and the way it should beinverted to recover the original network measurements. Here we take the new direction ofstudying the spectral properties of packet sampled traffic. A novel technique to model theimpact of packet sampling is proposed based on a theoretical analysis of network traffic inthe frequency domain. Moreover; a real-time algorithm is also presented to detect thespectrum portion of the network traffic that can be restored once packet sampling has beenapplied. Preliminary experimental results are reported to validate the proposed approach.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement,2009,12
Simulation-based study of link-level hybrid FEC/ARQ-SR for wireless links and long-lived TCP traffic,Alaeddine Al Fawal; Chadi Barakat,Since the TCP protocol uses the loss of packets as an indication of network congestion; itsperformance degrades over wireless links; which are characterized by a high bit error rate.Different solutions have been proposed to improve the performance of TCP over wirelesslinks; the most promising one being the use of a hybrid model at the link level combiningFEC (Forward Error Correction); ARQ-SR (Automatic Repeat Request with SelectiveRepeat); and an in-order delivery of packets to IP. The drawback of FEC is that it consumessome extra bandwidth to transmit the redundant information. ARQ-SR does not consumemuch bandwidth; its drawback is that it increases the round-trip time (RTT); which maydeteriorate the performance of TCP; if not done appropriately. We study in this paper theperformance of TCP over a wireless link implementing hybrid FEC/ARQ-SQ. The study is …,WiOpt'03: Modeling and Optimization in Mobile; Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks,2003,12
On Internet backbone traffic modeling,Chadi Barakat; Patrick Thiran; Gianluca Iannaccone; Christophe Diot,Abstract The motivation of this work is to design a traffic model that can be used in routers orby network administrators to assist in network design and management. Currently; networkoperators have very basic information about the traffic. They mostly use SNMP; whichprovides average throughput information over 5 minutes intervals. An analytical model canprovide more accurate information on the traffic such as its variation and its auto-correlationat short timescales. In contrast to other works (see [2] and the references therein); we chooseto model the traffic on a link that is not congested (congestion possibly appears elsewhere inthe Internet). This assumption is valid (and in fact is the rule) for backbone links that aregenerally over-provisioned (ie; the network is designed so that a backbone link does notreach 50% utilization in the absence of link failure [4]). This choice is driven by our main …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2002,12
A membership management protocol for mobile P2P networks,Mohamed Karim Sbai; Emna Salhi; Chadi Barakat,Abstract MANETs are self-organizing networks composed of mobile wireless nodes withoften scarce resources. Distributed applications based on the P2P paradigm are by naturegood candidates to run over such networks. To profit from the service provided by a P2Poverlay (eg file sharing using BitTorrent); a peer needs to be permanently informed aboutthe other members of the overlay (eg other peers interested in the same file as currentlyprovided by the BitTorrent central tracker). However; this P2P membership management is acostly and difficult task in a dynamic and resource limited environment as a MANET. Wefocus on this problem and we propose a robust; network friendly and decentralizedmembership management protocol allowing peer discovery and update.

Using active networks technology for dynamic QoS,T Tansupasiri; K Kanchanasut; C Barakat; P Jacquet,Abstract We propose a dynamic QoS; or D-QoS; model where QoS settings can beautomatically reconfigured based upon requests from authorized users. Different levels ofprivilege can be assigned to users enabling higher privileged users to interrupt the networkflows belonging to those of lower privileged levels. To request for a special QoS treatment; auser can issue an active packet to interrupt any active node along its flow path which is D-QoS enabled. The request for a specific interruption level is approved by a D-QoS enablednode which allows for multi-level interruptions to be handled. After an interrupting flow hascompleted transmitting all its packets; D-QoS enabled node can resume its services forthose pending flows which are of lower privilege levels. In this paper; we describe theoverall concept of D-QoS and demonstrate how it can be implemented by a small …,Computer Networks,2006,11
Analysis of scalable TCP,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat; Arzad Alam Kherani; BJ Prabhu,Abstract Scalable TCP [x] is a proposition for a new TCP where both the increase and thedecrease rate of the window size are multiplicative. It has been recently proposed in order toimprove performance in high speed networks. In this paper; we present a mathematicalanalysis of such multiplicative increase multiplicative decrease protocols in the presence ofrandom losses. These are typical to wireless networks but can also model losses in wirelinenetworks with very high bandwidth delay product. Our approach is based on showing thatthe logarithm of the window size evolution has the same behaviour as the workload processin a standard G/G/1 queue. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the equivalent queue is shownto provide directly the throughput of Scalable TCP as well as the higher moments of thewindow size. We validate our findings using ns-2 simulations.,High Speed Networks and Multimedia Communications,2004,11
On ACK filtering on a slow reverse channel,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Abstract ACK filtering has been proposed as a technique to alleviate the congestion on thereverse path of a TCP connection. In the literature the case of a one-ACK per connection at atime in the buffer at the input of a slow channel has been studied. In this paper we show thatthis is too aggressive for short transfers. We study first static filtering where a certain ACKqueue length is allowed. We show analytically how this length needs to be chosen. Wepresent then some algorithms that adapt the filtering of ACKs as a function of the slowchannel utilization rather than the ACK queue length.,International journal of satellite communications and networking,2003,11
Enhancing application identification by means of sequential testing,Mohamad Jaber; Chadi Barakat,Abstract One of the most important challenges for network administrators is the identificationof applications behind the Internet traffic. This identification serves for many purposes as innetwork security; traffic engineering and monitoring. The classical methods based onstandard port numbers or deep packet inspection are unfortunately becoming less and lessefficient because of encryption and the utilization of non standard ports. In this paper wecome up with an online iterative probabilistic method that identifies applications quickly andaccurately by only using the size of packets. Our method associates a configurableconfidence level to the port number carried in the transport header and is able to consider avariable number of packets at the beginning of a flow. By verification on real traces weobserve that even in the case of no confidence in the port number; a very high accuracy …,NETWORKING 2009,2009,10
Storage on Wheels: Offloading Popular Contents Through a Vehicular Cloud,Luigi Vigneri; Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos; Chadi Barakat,The increasing demand for mobile data is overloading the cellular infrastructure. Small cellsand edge caching is being explored as an alternative; but installation and maintenancecosts for sufficient coverage are significant. In this work; we perform a preliminary study of analternative architecture based on two main ideas:(i) using vehicles as mobile caches thatcan be accessed by user devices; compared to small cells; vehicles are more widespreadand require lower costs;(ii) combining the mobility of vehicles with delayed content access toincrease the number of cache hits (and reduce the load on the infrastructure). Contrary tostandard DTN-type approaches; in our system max delays are guaranteed to be kept to afew minutes (beyond this deadline; the content is fetched from the infrastructure).

When AIMD meets ICN: a bandwidth sharing perspective,Damien Saucez; Ilaria Cianci; Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Chadi Barakat,Information-centric networking (ICN) leverages content demand redundancy and proposesin-network caching to reduce network and servers load and to improve quality of experience.In this paper; we study the interaction between in-network caching of ICN and AdditiveIncrease Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) end-to-end congestion control with a focus on howbandwidth is shared; as a function of content popularity and cache provisioning. As cachingshortens AIMD feedback loop; the download rate of AIMD is impacted. Supported by ananalytical model based on Discriminatory Processor Sharing and real experiments; weobserve that popular contents benefit from caching and realize a shorter download time atthe expense of unpopular contents; which see their download time inflated by a factorbounded by 1/1-ρ where ρ is the network load.

Inter-protocol fairness between TCP New Reno and TCP Westwood,Niels Moller; Chadi Barakat; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Eitan Altman,TCP Westwood+ on regular TCP New Reno. By means of analytical modeling and ns-2simulations; we demonstrate that the two protocols get different shares of the availablebandwidth in the network. Our main result is that the bandwidth sharing between the twoprotocols depends on one crucial parameter: the ratio between the bottleneck router buffersize and the bandwidth delay product. If the ratio is smaller than one; TCP Westwood+ takesmore bandwidth. On the contrary; if the ratio is greater than one; it is TCP New Reno whichgets the larger part. Inspired by our results; we propose a simple modification to the windowdecrease algorithm in TCP Westwood+ that solves the unfairness problem for large buffersizes. For small buffers; the unfairness problem is still open.,Next Generation Internet Networks; 3rd EuroNGI Conference on,2007,8
Landmark-based end-to-end bandwidth inference,Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,The end-to-end delay among a set of peers can be easily and scalably estimated using alandmark approach Peers' coordinates are deduced from delay measurements to a smallnumber N of landmarks L {L1;...; Ln}. We wonder whether it is feasible to use suchdistributed solution for bandwidth estimation. This requires that each peer determines itsbandwidth vector by measuring the direct and reverse bandwidth on its path with eachlandmark. The bandwidth vectors of two peers are then used to estimate the bandwidthbetween them in both ways. For a couple of peers; we denote by (i) direct path the networkpath that joins them directly using IP routing; and by (ii) indirect path the path that joins themvia a landmark node. N indirect paths (N being the number of landmarks) are assigned toeach direct path. Our idea is to estimate the bandwidth of the direct path using those of …,Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications,2006,8
Analysis of TCP in networks with small buffering capacity and large bandwidth-delay product,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,It is well known that inefficiencies occur in the operation of TCP when the bandwidth delayproduct of the network is large compared to its buffering capacity. A central reason for that isa cyclic behavior of the protocol in which two consecutive slow-start phases appear in eachcycle [5; 1]. This results in low throughput and under-utilization of the available bandwidth.We show in this paper that; for an even larger ratio between the bandwidth-delay productand the buffer size; which is typical for satellite links; a new regime of three consecutive slow-start phases occurs. We need to refine previously studied models in order to explain thisphenomeno-n. We analyze in this paper this phenomenon; predict when it occurs andevaluate the corresponding average throughput of the connection.,*,1998,8
Towards a General Solution for Detecting Traffic Differentiation At the Internet Access,Riccardo Ravaioli; Guillaume Urvoy-Keller; Chadi Barakat,In recent years network neutrality has been widely debated from both technical andeconomic points of view. Various cases of traffic differentiation at the Internet access havebeen reported throughout the last decade; in particular aimed at bandwidth consuming trafficflows. In this paper we present a novel application-agnostic method for the detection of trafficdifferentiation; through which we are able to correctly identify where a shaper is located withrespect to the user and evaluate whether it affected delays; packet losses or both. The toolwe propose; ChkDiff; replays the user's own traffic in order to target routers at the first fewhops from the user. By comparing the resulting flow delays and losses to the same routeragainst one other; and analyzing the behaviour on the immediate router topology spawningfrom the user end-point; ChkDiff manages to detect instances of traffic shaping.

Lightweight enhanced monitoring for high speed networks,Rosa Vilardi; Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Chadi Barakat; Gennaro Boggia,ABSTRACT In this paper; a lightweight enhanced monitoring (LEMON) algorithm based onpacket sampling; is proposed. It targets a preassigned accuracy on bitrate estimates; foreach monitored flow at a router interface. To this end; LEMON takes into account some basicproperties of the flows; which can be easily inferred from a sampled stream; and it exploitsthem to dynamically adapt the monitoring time window on a per-flow basis. Its effectivenesshas been tested using real packet traces. Experimental results show that LEMON is able tofinely tune; in real time; the monitoring window associated to each flow; and; compared witha classic fixed scale monitoring approach; it is able to better satisfy the accuracyrequirements of bitrate estimates. Moreover; its communication overhead can be kept lowenough by choosing an appropriate aggregation policy in the message exporting process …,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,2013,7
A Frequency Domain Model to Predict the Estimation Accuracy of Packet Sampling,Grieco Luigi Alfredo; Chadi Barakat,In network measurement systems; packet sampling techniques are usually adopted toreduce the overall amount of data to collect and process. Being based on a subset ofpackets; they hence introduce estimation errors that have to be properly counteracted by aﬁne tuning of the sampling strategy and sophisticated inversion methods. This problem hasbeen deeply investigated in the literature with particular attention to the statistical propertiesof packet sampling and the recovery of the original network measurements. Herein; wepropose a novel approach to predict the energy of the sampling error on the real time trafﬁcvolume estimation; based on a spectral analysis in the frequency domain.

Experiences on enhancing data collection in large networks,Mohamed Karim Sbai; Chadi Barakat,Abstract We improve and validate TICP [C. Barakat; M. Malli; N. Nonaka; TICP: TransportInformation Collection Protocol; Annals of Telecommunications 61 (1–2)(2006) 167–192];our TCP-friendly reliable transport protocol to collect information from a large number ofInternet entities. A collector machine sends probes to a set of information sources that replyby sending back their reports. TICP adapts the sending rate of probes in a way similar toTCP for the purpose of avoiding network congestion and keeps requesting reports until theyare well received. In a first part of this work; we add to TICP a mechanism to clusterinformation sources in order to smooth the variation of network conditions during thecollection session and to ensure an efficient handling of congestion at network bottlenecks.Simulations in ns-2 and PlanetLab experiments prove the outperformance of TICP over …,Computer Networks,2009,7
Analysis of TCP Westwood+ in high speed networks,E Altman; C Barakat; S Mascolo; N Möller; J Sun,Abstract TCP Westwood+ is modelled and analyzed using stochastic recursive equations. Itis shown that for links with Poisson losses and independent and varying delays; TCPWestwood converges to a stationary process with a finite average throughput. The resultingthroughput is computed explicitly; and it is shown that it does not depend on the filteringcoefficient α in the bandwidth filter of TCP Westwood+.,International Workshop on Protocols for Fast Long-Distance Networks; Nara; Japan,2006,7
Analysis of the phenomenon of several slow start phases in TCP (poster session),Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,TCP is known to send bursts of packets during its slow start phase due to the fast windowincrease and the ACK-clock based transmission [1; 2; 4]. If buffers in network routers are notwell dimensioned to absorb these bursts; they will overflow prematurely before reaching thecapacity of the network or even before reaching a slow start threshold set to less than thiscapacity. By capacity of the network we mean the maximum number of packets that can be fitbetween the source and the destination. The result is an underestimation of the networkcapacity and a deterioration in performance. The problem has been studied in [1; 4] in caseof the Tahoe version where it has been shown that; for a buffer size smaller than one thirdthe bandwidth-delay product; TCP requires two consecutive slow start phases to reach thecongestion avoidance phase. Recall that with Tahoe; the window is set to one packet and …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2000,7
On the Incentives and Incremental Deployments of ICN technologies for OTT Services,Damien Saucez; Stefano Secci; Chadi Barakat,With the explosion of broadband Over-The-Top (OTT) services; the Internet is autonomouslymigrating toward overlay and incrementally deployable content distribution infrastructures.Information-Centric Networking (ICN) technologies are the natural candidates to efficientlydistribute popular content to users. However; the strategic incentives in exploiting ICN; forboth users and ISPs; are much less understood to date.

Network-wide monitoring through self-configuring adaptive system,Imed Lassoued; Amir Krifa; Chadi Barakat; Konstantin Avrachenkov,The remarkable growth of the Internet infrastructure and the increasing heterogeneity ofapplications and users' behavior make more complex the manageability and monitoring ofISP networks and raises the cost of any new deployment. The main consequence of thistrend is an inherent disagreement between existing monitoring solutions and the increasingneeds of management applications. In this context; we present the design of an adaptivecentralized architecture that provides visibility over the entire network through a network-wide cognitive monitoring system. Practically; given a measurement task and a constraint onthe volume of collected information; the proposed architecture drives the sampling rates onthe interfaces of network routers to achieve the maximum possible accuracy; while adaptingitself to any change in network traffic conditions.

Application-level versus Network-level Proximity,Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,Abstract We motivate in this paper the need for application-level proximity. This proximity is afunction of network characteristics that decide on the application performance. Most ofexisting protocols rely on the network-level proximity as for example the one based on thedelay (eg; the delay closest peer is the best peer to contact). In this paper; we study howmuch the two proximity definitions differ from each other. The work consists of runningextensive measurements over the PlanetLab overlay network and comparing differentproximity definitions. Our major observation is that the delay proximity is not always a goodpredictor of quality and that other network parameters are to be considered as well based onthe application requirements. Particulary; the best peer to contact is not always the delayclosest one. This can be explained by our other observation; that of the slight correlation …,Asian Internet Engineering Conference,2005,6
On the correlation of TCP traffic in backbone networks,Hung Xuan Nguyen; Patrick Thiran; Chadi Barakat,We study the second order statistics of traffic in an Internet backbone. We model the traffic atthe flow level by a Poisson shot noise process. This model is quite parasimonious; and isdriven only by variables that can be easily obtained from measurements; namely flow sizes;durations and arrival rate. We consider the auto-correlation of TCP traffic where the lossprocess of each TCP connection is assumed to be Poisson. Using a stochastic differentialequation; we are able to provide an upper bound on the auto-covariance function of theaggregated TCP traffic whose tightness is shown by simulations with the network simulator-ns.,Circuits and Systems; 2004.

Dynamic resource allocation in core routers of a Diffserv network,Rares Serban; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,Abstract The Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture is receiving wide attention as aframework for providing different levels of service according to a Service Level Agreement(SLA) profile. The edge routers in a DiffServ network mark/shape/police flows based on theirSLAs; and the core routers offer packets different treatments using the marks they carry.Core routers handle aggregates of flows instead of individual flows; which is known toconsiderably reduce the complexity of DiffServ. Tuning core routers is clearly an importantissue to satisfy the needs of traffic marked at the edges. This tuning is actually characterizedby extensive manual work; based on a trial-and-error process; which is often ineffective; time-consuming and costly to network managers. In this paper; we propose a dynamic; self-tuningmechanism for allocating resources in core routers among Diffserv services. Our …,Annual Asian Computing Science Conference,2002,6

TICP: Transport Information Collection Protocol,Chadi Barakat; Mohammad Malli; Noamichi Nonaka,Abstract We present and validate Ticp; a TCP-friendly reliable transport protocol to collectinformation from a large number of sources spread over the Internet. Ticp is a stand-aloneprotocol that can be used by any application requiring the reliable collection of information. Itensures two main functions:(i) the information arrives at the collector entirely andcorrectly;(ii) the implosion at the collector and the congestion of the network are avoided.The congestion control in Ticp is done by having the collector probe the sources at a ratefunction of network conditions. The probing rate increases and decreases in a way similar tohow TCP adapts its congestion window. We implement Ticp in ns-2 and validate itsperformance. In particular; we show how efficient Ticp is in quickly and reliably collectinginformation from a large number of sources; while avoiding network congestion and being …,Annales des Telecommunications,2006,5
A CBQ-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation Mechanism for Diffserv Routers,Rares Serban; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,Résumé: Class Based Queueing (CBQ) is a link-sharing and resource managementmechanism for packet networks. The weights of CBQ control the way with which theavailable bandwidth at the output interface of the router is distributed among the differentclasses of the input traffic. CBQ also disposes of rules for bandwidth borrowing based on ahierarchy of classes. In [1]; we proposed a dynamic; self-tuning mechanism for allocatingresources in Diffserv routers called DRAM (Dynamic Resource Allocation Mechanism). Therouters in [1] are supposed to implement a simple version of CBQ equivalent to WeightedFair Queuing (WFQ); where the bandwidth borrowing feature of CBQ is disabled. DRAMtunes the weights of WFQ so that each class of traffic realizes its needs; and the resources ofthe network are efficiently utilized.

We explain qualitativel-y the shape of thepacket interarrival time distribution. In particular; we provide conditions under which thedistribution of the inter packet arrivals is close to exponential and show how this conditionscales when the network capacity becomes large. In addition; we analyze the structure of theautocorrelation function of times between packet arrivals. For the case of a packet arrivalprocess close to Poisson; we develop a Fixed Point based model that allows us to computethe packet loss probability and the utilization of the bottleneck link.,*,2003,5

Characterizing icmp rate limitation on routers,Riccardo Ravaioli; Guillaume Urvoy-Keller; Chadi Barakat,In the last decade; path discovery has been extensively covered in the literature. In itssimplest form; it generally works by sending probes that expire along the path from a host toa destination. It is also known that network administrators often configure their routers to limitthe amount of ICMP replies sent; a common practice typically referred to as ICMP ratelimitation. In this paper we attempt to characterize the responsiveness of routers to expiringICMP echo-request packets. Our contribution is twofold: first; we provide a detailed analysisof how routers are most commonly configured to respond to expiring packets; next; we showthat for the vast majority of routers; the measured round-trip time is not affected by theprobing rate.,2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),2015,4
A multi-task adaptive monitoring system combining different sampling primitives,Imed Lassoued; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Traffic measurement and analysis are crucial management activities for networkoperators. With the increase in traffic volume; operators resort to sampling primitives toreduce the measurement load. Unfortunately; existing systems use sampling primitivesseparately and configure them statically to achieve some performance objective. It becomesthen important to design a new system that combines different existing sampling primitivestogether to support a large spectrum of monitoring tasks while providing the best possibleaccuracy by spatially correlating measurements and adapting the configuration to trafficvariability. In this paper; and to prove the interest of the joint approach; we introduce anadaptive system that combines two sampling primitives; packet sampling and flow sampling;and that is able to satisfy multiple monitoring tasks.

Spectral models for bitrate measurement from packet sampled traffic,Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Chadi Barakat; Michele Marzulli,In network measurement systems; packet sampling techniques are usually adopted toreduce the overall amount of data to collect and process. Being based on a subset ofpackets; they introduce estimation errors that have to be properly counteracted by using afine tuning of the sampling strategy and sophisticated inversion methods. This problem hasbeen deeply investigated in the literature with particular attention to the statistical propertiesof packet sampling and to the recovery of the original network measurements. Herein; wepropose a novel approach to predict the energy of the sampling error in the real timeestimation of traffic bitrate; based on spectral analysis in the frequency domain. We start bydemonstrating that the error introduced by packet sampling can be modeled as an aliasingeffect in the frequency domain.

CHESS: An application-aware space for enhanced scalable services in overlay networks,Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,Abstract We introduce in this paper CHESS; an application-aware space for enhancedscalable (In our context; the scalability feature is satisfied when the system overhead islinear with the number of its nodes.) services in overlay networks. In this new space; theproximity of peers is determined according to a utility function that considers the networkparameters (eg; delay; bandwidth; and loss rate) impacting application performance. Wemotivate the need for this new notion by showing that the proximity in the delay space doesnot automatically lead to a proximity in another space (eg; space of the bandwidth). Fordetermining the proximity in CHESS; network parameters must be estimated easily andscalably. Therefore; we use the matrix factorization approach for estimating the delay andloss parameters. Besides; we propose a scalable model that estimates the bandwidth …,Computer Communications,2008,4

It covers optimal on-line estimation algorithms for determiningthe membership of a multicast group. The paper briefly reviews the related work and ourown contributions to the field.

Estimating the access link quality by active measurements,Roberto G Cascella; Chadi Barakat,The access link quality experienced by the end users depends on the amount of traffic andon the presence of network anomalies. Different techniques exist to detect anomalies; butlittle attention has been devoted to quantify the access link quality and to which extentnetwork anomalies affect the end user's access link experience. We refer to this aspect asthe impact factor of the anomaly; that we define as the percentage of affected destinations. Inthe ideal case; a node should continuously monitor all possible routes to detect anydegradation in performance; but this is not practical in reality. In this paper we show how anode can estimate the quality of Internet access through a limited set of measurements. Weinitially study the user's access network to understand the typical features of its connectivitytree. Then; we define an unbiased estimator for the quality of access and we compute the …,Teletraffic Congress (ITC); 2010 22nd International,2010,3
Revisiting P2P content sharing in wireless ad hoc networks,Mohamed Karim Sbai; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Classical content sharing applications like BitTorrent are not designed to run overwireless networks. When adapting them to these constrained networks; two main problemsarise. On one hand; exchanging content pieces with far nodes results in an important routingoverhead. On the other hand; it is necessary to send some content pieces to far nodes toincrease the diversity of information in the network; which fosters reciprocity and parallelexchanges. In this paper; we study both of these problems and propose a joint solution forthem. Unlike uni-metric approaches; our solution considers relevant performance metricstogether as throughput; sharing and routing overhead. We define a new neighbor selectionstrategy that balances sharing and diversification efforts and decides on the optimalneighboring scope of a node. We also consider the diversification incentives problem and …,International Workshop on Self-Organizing Systems,2009,3

Certified Internet Coordinates,Mohamed Ali Kaafar; Laurent Mathy; Chadi Barakat; Kavé Salamatian; Thierry Turletti; Walid Dabbous,We address the issue of asserting the accuracy of coordinates advertised by nodes ofInternet coordinate systems during distance estimations. Indeed; some nodes may liedeliberately about their coordinates to mount various attacks against applications andoverlays. Our proposed method consists in two steps: 1) establish the correctness of anode's claimed coordinate (which leverages our previous work on securing the coordinatesembedding phase using a Surveyor infrastructure); and 2) issue a time limited validitycertificate for each verified coordinate. Validity periods are computed based on an analysisof coordinate inter-shift times observed on PlanetLab; and shown to follow a long-taildistribution (lognormal distribution in most cases; or Weibull distribution otherwise).

An enhanced scalable proximity model,Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat; Walid Dabbous,In this paper; an enhanced scalable proximity model is described. This work investigates thebandwidth estimation problem and it is impact on the quality of service of the file sharingapplication. The file transfer application over the TCP protocol is considered and it can beencountered in the emerging file sharing P2P applications or in the replicated Web servercontext. Since the impact of the bandwidth estimation is the main concern; the large TCPtransfer due to its sensitivity to the parameter is considered.

At the same time; theinference of this topology is of particular importance for network operators and users. Itguarantees an efficient operation of the network and a better tuning of its protocols andapplications. For this reason; we survey in this work the body of the literature that deals withInternet topology inference. We classify the works based on their belonging to either theactive or passive approach and we provide a summary of the main measurement tools inthis field.,*,2004,3
Quality of Experience-Aware Mobile Edge Caching through a Vehicular Cloud,Luigi Vigneri; Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Densification through small cells and caching in base stations have been proposedto deal with the increasing demand for Internet content and the related overload on thecellular infrastructure. However; these solutions are expensive to install and maintain.Instead; using vehicles acting as mobile caches might represent an interesting alternative. Inour work; we assume that users can query nearby vehicles for some time; and be redirectedto the cellular infrastructure when the deadline expires. Beyond reducing costs; in such anarchitecture; through vehicle mobility; a user sees a much larger variety of locally accessiblecontent within only few minutes. Unlike most of the related works on delay tolerant access;we consider the impact on the user experience by assigning different retrieval deadlines percontent.

Streaming Content from a Vehicular Cloud,Luigi Vigneri; Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos; Chadi Barakat,Abstract Network densification via small cells is considered as a key step to cope with thedata tsunami. Caching data at small cells or even user devices is also considered as apromising way to alleviate the backhaul congestion this densification might cause. However;the former suffers from high deployment and maintenance costs; and the latter from limitedresources and privacy issues with user devices. We argue that an architecture with (public orprivate) vehicles acting as mobile caches and communication relays might be a promisingmiddle ground. In this paper; we assume such a vehicular cloud is in place to provide videostreaming to users; and that the operator can decide which content to store in the vehiclecaches. Users can then greedily fill their playout buffer with video pieces of the streamedcontent from encountered vehicles; and turn to the infrastructure immediately when the …,Tenth ACM MobiCom Workshop on Challenged Networks (CHANTS),2016,2
Geographically Fair In-Network Caching for Mobile Data Offloading,Mahmoud El Chamie; Chadi Barakat; Giovanni Neglia,Data offloading from the cellular network to low-cost WiFi has been the subject of severalresearch works in the last years. In-network caching has also been studied as an efficientmeans to further reduce cellular network traffic. In this paper we consider a scenario wheremobile users can download popular contents (eg; maps of a city; shopping information;social media; etc.) from WiFi-enabled caches deployed in an urban area. We study theoptimal distribution of contents among the caches (ie; what contents to put in each cache) tominimize users' access cost in the whole network. We argue that this optimal distributiondoes not necessarily provide geographic fairness; ie; users at different locations canexperience highly variable performance. In order to mitigate this problem; we propose twodifferent cache coordination algorithms based on gossiping. These algorithms achieve …,IFIP Networking 2015,2015,2

Transport Information Collection Protocol with clustering of information sources,Mohamed Karim Sbai; Chadi Barakat,We improve and validate TICP; our TCP-friendly reliable transport protocol to collectinformation from a large number of sources spread over the Internet [1]. A collector machinesends probes to information sources that reply by sending back report packets containingtheir information. TICP adapts the probing rate in a way to avoid implosion at the collectorand network congestion. Lost packets are requested again by TICP until they are correctlyreceived. In this work; we add to TICP a mechanism to cluster information sources in order toprobe sources behind the same bottleneck together. This ensures a smooth variation ofnetwork conditions during the collection session and hence an efficient handling ofcongestion at the network bottlenecks. This mechanism is based upon the Global NetworkPositioning (GNP) Internet coordinate system. By running simulations in ns-2 over …,New technologies; mobility and security,2007,2
On active sampling of controlled experiments for QoE modeling,Muhammad Khokhar; Nawfal Saber; Thierry Spetebroot; Chadi Barakat,Abstract For internet applications; measuring; modeling and predicting the qualityexperienced by end users as a function of network conditions is challenging. A commonapproach for building application specific Quality of Experience (QoE) models is to rely oncontrolled experimentation. For accurate QoE modeling; this approach can result in a largenumber of experiments to carry out because of the multiplicity of the network features; theirlarge span (eg; bandwidth; delay) and the time needed to setup the experimentsthemselves. However; most often; the space of network features in which experimentationsare carried out shows a high degree of uniformity in the training labels of QoE. Thisuniformity; difficult to predict beforehand; amplifies the training cost with little or noimprovement in QoE modeling accuracy. So; in this paper; we aim to exploit this …,ACM SIGCOMM 2017 2nd Workshop on QoE-based Analysis and Management of Data Communication Networks (Internet-QoE 2017),2017,1

If from a legal point ofview many countries have discussed and approved laws in favor of Internet neutrality;confirmation with measuring tools for even an experienced user remains hard in practice. Inthis paper we extend and complete our tool ChkDiff; previously presented for the upstreamcase; by checking for shaping also on the user's downstream traffic. After attempting tolocalize shapers at the access ISP on upstream traffic; we replay downstream traffic from ameasurement server and analyze per-flow one-way delays and losses; while taking intoaccount the possibility of multiple paths between the two endpoints.

Tracking Relative Errors in Internet Coordinate Systems by a Kalman Filter,MA Kaafar; L Mathy; K Salamatian; C Barakat; T Turletti; W Dabbous,Internet Coordinate Systems; shortly ICS;(eg [9][8]) have been proposed to allow for distance(Round-Trip Time; shortly RTT) estimation between nodes; in order to reduce themeasurement overhead of many applications and overlay networks. Indeed; by embeddingthe Internet delay space into a metric space–an operation that only requires each node inthe system to measure delays to a small set of other nodes (its neighbors); nodes areattributed coordinates that can then be used to estimate the RTT between any two nodes;without further measurements; simply by applying the distance function associated with thechosen metric space to the nodes' coordinates.

Temporal resolution adaptation in real-time bitrate estimation from packed sampled traffic,Rosa Vilardi; Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Gennaro Boggia; Chadi Barakat,Packet sampling can greatly reduce traffic measurement overhead in high-speed networks.At the same time; this operation introduces estimation errors that have to be carefullyhandled to ensure a reasonable measurement accuracy. Recently; a frequency-basedapproach has been proposed to catch the impact of such errors in bitrate estimation of IPflows at various time-scales. In particular; a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noiseratio has been derived as a function of the packet sampling probability; the bin size; andsome basic information about the flow (ie; first and second order moments of the packet size;and long term average packet-rate). In this work; we adopt this model to design a real-timealgorithm that properly tunes the temporal resolution of bitrate estimates available at arouter; with the goal of assuring a target measurement accuracy.

Modeling the AIADD paradigm in networks with variable delays,G Boggia; P Camarda; A D'Alconzo; LA Grieco; S Mascolo; E Altman; C Barakat,Abstract Modeling TCP is fundamental for understanding Internet behavior. The reason isthat TCP is responsible for carrying a huge quota of the Internet traffic. During last decademany analytical models have attempted to capture dynamics and steady-state behavior ofstandard TCP congestion control algorithms. In particular; models proposed in literaturehave been mainly focused on finding relationships among the throughput achieved by aTCP flow; the segment loss probability; and the round trip time (RTT) of the connection;which the flow goes through. Recently; Westwood+ TCP algorithm has been proposed toimprove the performance of classic New Reno TCP; especially over paths characterized byhigh bandwidth-delay products.

Revisiting Internet Topology: Application-centric Approach,Mohammad Malli,We introduce in this thesis the notion of CHESS; an application-aware space for enhancedscalable services in overlay networks. In this new space; the proximity is a function ofnetwork parameters (eg; delay and bandwidth) that decide on the application performance.We motivate the need for this new notion by showing that the network parameters areslightly correlated.

Application-Aware Model for Peer Selection,Mohammad Malli; Chadi Barakat,We introduce in this paper the notion of application-aware optimal peer selection. With theadvent of P2P and overlay networks; many applications of our days need to select the bestpeer to contact; either to transfer some data or to be positioned in an overlay network. Thisselection is still with no clear solution given the heterogeneity of the Internet in terms of pathcharacteristics and access link speed; and the diversity of application requirements. Most ofexisting protocols rely on simple heuristics as for example choosing the closest peer in termsof delay. We believe that the selection of the best peer should be a function of moreparameters (delay; bandwidth; loss rate) and subject to some application utility function (eg;delay vs. bandwidth). This work aims at motivating the need for taking applicationrequirements coupled with network path measurements into account during the peer …,*,2006,1

A distance-aware model of 802.11 MAC layer,Chadi Barakat; Gion Reto Cantieni,We present in this paper an analytical model that accounts for the positions of stations withrespect to the Access Point while evaluating the performance of 802.11 MAC layer. Ourmodel is based on the Bianchi's work where the performance of 802.11 MAC layer iscomputed using a discrete time Markov chain; but where all stations are implicitly assumedto be located at the same distance to the Access Point. In our model; given the position ofone station; we compute its saturation throughput while conditioning on the positions of theother concurrent stations. Our model also gives the total saturation throughput of themedium. We solve the model numerically and we show that the saturation throughput of onestation is strongly dependent on its own position and on the positions of the other stations.One station achieves a high throughput when it is close to the Access Point and loses …,*,2003,1
Impact of Buffer Size on TCP Start-Up,Chadi Barakat; Eitan Altman,Abstract The Slow Start (SS) phase at the beginning of a TCP connection affects theperformance of short transfers especially on long delay links such as Satellite Links. Manyworks have tried to improve the performance of this phase either by accelerating thecongestion window increase or by setting the SS threshold at the beginning of theconnection to a more accurate value in order to avoid losses and a long Timeout. However;these works don't account for the size of buffers in network nodes. In this paper; we present ageneral analysis of this first phase as a function of the network and TCP parameters. Amongour results; we show that as claimed; the previous works improve the performance on pathswith large buffers. However; on paths with small buffers; completely different results can beobtained.,Proc. of IEEE Middle East Workshop on Networking; Beirut; Lebanon,1999,1

Trading Routing for Better Efficiency,Xuan-Nam Nguyen; Damien Saucez; Chadi Barakat; Thierry Turletti,ABSTRACT The idea behind Software Defined Networking (SDN) is to conceive the networkas one programmable entity rather than a set of devices to manually configure; andOpenFlow meets this objective. In OpenFlow; a centralized programmable controller installsrules onto switches to implement policies. However; this flexibility comes at the expense ofextra overhead as the number of rules might exceed the memory capacity of switches; whichraises the question of how to place most profitable rules on board. Solutions proposed so farstrictly impose paths to be followed inside the network. We advocate instead that we cantrade routing requirements within the network to concentrate on where to forward traffic; nothow to do it. As an illustration of the concept; we propose an optimization problem that getsthe maximum amount of traffic delivered according to policies and the actual …,*,2014,*

SPIRA: A Network-Friendly Topology Discovery Protocol,Mohamed Karim Sbai; Mohamad Jaber; Chadi Barakat,The Internet being very large and rapidly evolving; it is always difficult to maintain a real-timeview of its topology without continuously flooding it with a large number of concur-rent probepackets. Although there have been considerable re-search efforts to reduce the number ofthese probes (eg reducing redundancies); the congestion and network overhead they causehave often been overlooked. In this paper; we propose SPIRA; a network-friendly protocol todiscover the Internet topology.

Boosting statistical application identification by flow correlation,Mohamad Jaber; Roberto G Cascella; Chadi Barakat,Abstract—In this paper; we propose a new online method for traffic classification thatcombines the statistical and host-based approaches in order to construct a robust andprecise method for early Internet traffic identification. We use the packet size as the mainfeature for the classification and we benefit from the traffic profile of the host (ie; whichapplication and how much) to decide in favor of this or that application. This profile isupdated online based on the result of the classification of previous flows originated by oraddressed to the same host. We evaluate our method on real traces using severalapplications. The results show that leveraging the traffic pattern of the host ameliorates theperformance of statistical methods. They also prove the capacity of our solution to deriveprofiles for the traffic of Internet hosts and to identify the services they provide.,Euro-NF International Workshop on Trafic and Congestion Control for the Future Internet,2011,*

In a first stage; weconfirm the fact that Vivaldi coordinates oscillate over time because of the adaptive nature ofthe system.

A Multilevel Approach for the Modelling of Large TCP/IP Networks,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat; Kartikeya Chandrayana,We present in this paper an analytical model for the calculation of network load and dropprobabilities in a TCP/IP network with general topology. Our model does not require thepredefinition of bottleneck links. The model is based on analytical expressions for TCPthroughput; which allows it to take into account diverse TCP features as the receivercongestion window limitation. It can be used for TCP/IP networks with drop tail routers aswell as for TCP/IP networks with active queue management routers. First; we formulate ourmodel as a Non-Linear Complementarity problem (NCP). Then; we transform the model intotwo equivalent formulations: fixed point formulation and nonlinear programming formulation.Thereupon; using asymptotic analysis; we prove existence of a unique solution to the NCPby casting it into the well known utility optimization framework.

This requires to define a proximity function that evaluates how much twopeers are close to each other from application point of view. Different functions areintroduced in the literature to characterize the proximity of peers; but most of them are basedon simple metrics such as the delay; the number of hops and the geographical location. Webelieve that these metrics are not enough to characterize the proximity given theheterogeneity of the Internet in terms of path characteristics and access link speed; and thediversity of application requirements.

To profit from the service provided by a P2P overlay(eg file sharing); a node needs to be permanently informed about its members (eg otherpeers interested in the same file). This P2P membership management is a costly and difficulttask in such dynamic and resource limited environment.

PNA-R0005 July 31; 2000,E Altman; K Avrachenkov; C Barakat; R Núñez Queija,ABSTRACT We study a TCP-like linear-increase multiplicative-decrease ow controlmechanism. We consider congestion signals that arrive in batches according to a Poissonprocess. We focus on the case when the transmission rate cannot exceed a certainmaximum value. The distribution of the transmission rate in steady state as well as itsmoments are determined. Our model is particularly useful to study the behavior of TCP; thecongestion control mechanism in the Internet. Burstiness of packet losses is captured byallowing congestion signals to arrive in batches. By a simple transformation; the problemcan be reformulated in terms of an equivalent M/G/1 queue; where the transmission rate inthe original model corresponds to the workload in thedual'queue. The service times in thequeueing model are not iid; and they depend on the workload in the system.,*,*,*

Adaptation of Real-time Temporal Resolution for Bitrate Estimates in IPFIX Systems,Rosa Vilardi; Luigi Alfredo Grieco; Gennaro Boggia; Chadi Barakat,Abstract—Packet sampling can greatly reduce traffic measure-ment overhead in high-speedbroadband networks. At the same time; this operation introduces estimation errors that haveto be carefully handled to ensure a reasonable measurement accuracy. Recently; afrequency-based approach has been proposed to catch the impact of such errors in bitrateestimation of a generic IP traffic flow; binned at both small and high time-scales. In particular;a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio has been derived as a function of thepacket sampling probability; the bin size; and some basic information about the flow (ie; firstand second order moments of the packet size; and long term average packet-rate).

Complementarity Formulation for TCP/IP Networks: Uniqueness of Solution and Relation with Utility Optimization,Eitan Altman; Konstantin Avrachenkov; Chadi Barakat; Kartikeya Chandrayana,Abstract—One of the primary concerns for the network providers in designing or upgrading anetwork is deciding where to add capacity. This in turn requires uniquely identifying thecongestion hot-spots. However; the current models for predicting network behavior areconstrained by the fact that they require prior identification of the bottleneck; which is indirect contrast with the objective. In this paper we propose a Non-Linear Complementaritymodel for TCP/IP networks which can not only identify bottleneck links but also predictsteady state link loss probabilities. We also show that full-row rank (where row representsnumber of links in the topology) of Incidence Matrix is a sufficient condition for all models tolocate the bottleneck links. However; in this paper we show that bottleneck links can beuniquely identified with the Non-Linear Complementarity model without any regulations …,*,*,*
Protocoles de transport pour la collecte d’informations et la surveillance des réseaux,Mohamed Karim SBAÏ; CRISTAL RIM; Pr Abdelfattah BELGHITH; Chadi BARAKAT; Pr Khaled GHEDIRA; Yassine JAMOUSSI,Résumé–La collecte d'informations à partir d'un grand nombre de sources réparties surl'Internet possède de plus en plus d'applications de nos jours. L'information collectée peutêtre la disponibilité des différentes entités du réseau; des statistiques sur les hôtes et lesrouteurs; la qualité de réception dans une session multipoint; un recensement de lapopulation; des résultats de votes; etc. Dans ce mémoire; nous validons et améliorons TICPun protocole de transport fiable et amical avec TCP pour collecte d'informations. Ceprotocole gère la congestion dans le réseau et l'implosion dans le collecteur. Il adapte ledébit d'émission des sondes aux conditions réseau. TICP partage la bande passantedisponible avec le trafic concurrent notamment le trafic TCP. Dans une première partie de cetravail; nous ajoutons à TICP un mécanisme de regroupement des sources d'informations …,*,*,*
