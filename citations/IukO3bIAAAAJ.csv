Provenance semirings,Todd J Green; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Val Tannen,Abstract We show that relational algebra calculations for incomplete databases; probabilisticdatabases; bag semantics and why-provenance are particular cases of the same generalalgorithms involving semirings. This further suggests a comprehensive provenancerepresentation that uses semirings of polynomials. We extend these considerations todatalog and semirings of formal power series. We give algorithms for datalog provenancecalculation as well as datalog evaluation for incomplete and probabilistic databases. Finally;we show that for some semirings containment of conjunctive queries is the same as forstandard set semantics.,Proceedings of the twenty-sixth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2007,595
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata,Todd J Green; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on anXML stream. Our main contribution consists in showing that Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a throughputof about 5.4 MB/s; independent of the number of XPath expressions (up to 1;000;000 in ourtests). The major problem we face is that of the size of the DFA. Since the number of statesgrows exponentially with the number of XPath expressions; it was previously believed thatDFAs cannot be used to process large sets of expressions. We make a theoretical analysisof the number of states in the DFA resulting from XPath expressions; and consider both thecase when it is constructed eagerly; and when it is constructed lazily. Our analysis indicatesthat; when the automaton is constructed lazily; and under certain assumptions about the …,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,313
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata and stream indexes,Todd J Green; Ashish Gupta; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on astream of XML packets. We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a singleDeterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can beused effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput;independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA;which; in theory; can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide aseries of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has asmall number of states; for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest inXPath processing; beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX(SIX); which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,259
Models for incomplete and probabilistic information,Todd J Green; Val Tannen,Abstract We discuss; compare and relate some old and some new models for incompleteand probabilistic databases. We characterize the expressive power of c-tables over infinitedomains and we introduce a new kind of result; algebraic completion; for studying lessexpressive models. By viewing probabilistic models as incompleteness models withadditional probability information; we define completeness and closure under querylanguages of general probabilistic database models and we introduce a new such model;probabilistic c-tables; that is shown to be complete and closed under the relational algebra.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,237
Update exchange with mappings and provenance,Todd J Green; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Zachary G Ives; Val Tannen,Abstract We consider systems for data sharing among heterogeneous peers related by anetwork of schema mappings. Each peer has a locally controlled and edited databaseinstance; but wants to ask queries over related data from other peers as well. To achievethis; every peer's updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers. However; thisupdate exchange is filtered by trust conditions---expressing what data and sources a peerjudges to be authoritative---which may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order tosupport such filtering; updates carry provenance information. These systems target scientificdata sharing applications; and their general principles and architecture have beendescribed in [20]. In this paper we present methods for realizing such systems. Specifically;we extend techniques from data integration; data exchange; and incremental view …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,180
Structure/activity studies of the nephrotoxic and mutagenic action of cysteine conjugates of chlgro and fluoroalkenes,Tf Green; J Odum,Summary The cysteine conjugates of the nephrotoxins hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD);tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and hexafluoropropene (HFP); together with those oftrichloroethylene and perchloroethylene; have been chemically synthesized and arelationship determined between their structures and their nephrotoxicity and mutagenicityin vitro. All of the conjugates had a marked effect on the uptake of both the organic anion p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and the cation tetraethylammonium bromide (TEA) into rat kidneyslices; suggesting activation of the conjugates in the slices to a toxic species which interfereswith ion transport. This observation is consistent with the known nephrotoxicity of HCBD;TFE and HFP in vivo. Each of the conjugates was found to be metabolised by rat kidneyslices and by semi-purified rat kidney β-lyase to pyruvate; ammonia and an unidentified …,Chemico-biological interactions,1985,179

The metabolism and nephrotoxicity of tetrafluoroethylene in the rat,J Odum; T Green,Abstract Exposure of rats to 6000 ppm tetrafluoroethylene for 6 hr produced marked damageto the proximal tubule of the kidney with no effect on the liver. The toxicity was characterizedby very high concentrations of urinary glucose and by marked increases in theconcentrations of several urinary enzymes. The no observed effect level for a 6-hr exposurewas 2000 ppm. Tetrafluoroethylene was metabolized to S-(1; 1; 2; 2-tetrafluoroethyl)glutathione by rat liver fractions in vitro; the reaction was catalyzed by both microsomal andcytosolic glutathione S-transferases. The rate with microsomes was four times that withcytosol fractions. Evidence for this metabolic pathway in vivo has been obtained by theidentification of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates of tetrafluoroethylene in rat bile.Cytochrome P-450 oxidation; a common metabolic route for haloalkenes; does not …,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,1984,124

Implementing mapping composition,Philip A Bernstein; Todd J Green; Sergey Melnik; Alan Nash,Abstract Mapping composition is a fundamental operation in metadata driven applications.Given a mapping over schemas¿ 1 and¿ 2 and a mapping over schemas¿ 2 and¿ 3; thecomposition problem is to compute an equivalent mapping over¿ 1 and¿ 3. We describe anew composition algorithm that targets practical applications. It incorporates view unfolding.It eliminates as many¿ 2 symbols as possible; even if not all can be eliminated. It coversconstraints expressed using arbitrary monotone relational operators and; to a lesser extent;non-monotone operators. And it introduces the new technique of left composition.

Annotated XML: queries and provenance,J Nathan Foster; Todd J Green; Val Tannen,Abstract We present a formal framework for capturing the provenance of data appearing inXQuery views of XML. Building on previous work on relations and their (positive) querylanguages; we decorate unordered XML with annotations from commutative semirings andshow that these annotations suffice for a large positive fragment of XQuery applied to thisdata. In addition to tracking provenance metadata; the framework can be used to representand process XML with repetitions; incomplete XML; and probabilistic XML; and provides abasis for enforcing access control policies in security applications.

ORCHESTRA: facilitating collaborative data sharing,Todd J Green; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Nicholas E Taylor; Olivier Biton; Zachary G Ives; Val Tannen,One of the most elusive goals of structured data management has been sharing amonglarge; heterogeneous populations: while data integration [4; 10] and exchange [3] aregradually being adopted by corporations or small confederations; little progress has beenmade in integrating broader communities. Yet the need for large-scale sharing ofheterogeneous data is increasing: most of the sciences; particularly biology and astronomy;have become data-driven as they have attempted to tackle larger questions. The field ofbioinformatics; in particular; has seen a plethora of different databases emerge: each isfocused on a related but subtly different collection of organisms (eg; CryptoDB; TIGR;FlyNome); genes (GenBank; GeneDB); proteins (UniProt; RCSB Protein Databank);diseases (OMIM; GeneDis); and so on.

The ORCHESTRA collaborative data sharing system,Zachary G Ives; Todd J Green; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Nicholas E Taylor; Val Tannen; Partha Pratim Talukdar; Marie Jacob; Fernando Pereira,Abstract Sharing structured data today requires standardizing upon a single schema; thenmapping and cleaning all of the data. This results in a single queriable mediated datainstance. However; for settings in which structured data is being collaboratively authored bya large community; eg; in the sciences; there is often a lack of consensus about how itshould be represented; what is correct; and which sources are authoritative. Moreover; suchdata is seldom static: it is frequently updated; cleaned; and annotated. The ORCHESTRAcollaborative data sharing system develops a new architecture and consistency model forsuch settings; based on the needs of data sharing in the life sciences. In this paper wedescribe the basic architecture and implementation of the ORCHESTRA system; andsummarize some of the open challenges that arise in this setting.,ACM Sigmod Record,2008,92

Containment of conjunctive queries on annotated relations,Todd J Green,Abstract We study containment and equivalence of (unions of) conjunctive queries onrelations annotated with elements of a commutative semiring. Such relations and thesemantics of positive relational queries on them were introduced in a recent paper as ageneralization of set semantics; bag semantics; incomplete databases; and databasesannotated with various kinds of provenance information. We obtain positive decidabilityresults and complexity characterizations for databases with lineage; why-provenance; andprovenance polynomial annotations; for both conjunctive queries and unions of conjunctivequeries. At least one of these results is surprising given that provenance polynomialannotations seem “more expressive” than bag semantics and under the latter; containmentof unions of conjunctive queries is known to be undecidable.

A mechanism for the development of Clara cell lesions in the mouse lung after exposure to trichloroethylene,JJRT Odum; JR Foster; T Green,Abstract Female CD-1 mice exposed to trichloroethylene (6 h/day) at concentrations from 20–2000 ppm developed a highly specific lung lesion after a single exposure; characterised byvacuolation of the Clara cells; the number of cells affected increasing with increasing doselevel. At the highest dose levels pyknosis of the Clara cells was apparent. After 5 days ofrepeated exposures the lesion had resolved but exposure of mice following a 2-day breakresulted in recurrence of the lesion. The changes in mouse lung Clara cells wereaccompanied by a marked loss of cytochrome P-450 activities. No morphological changeswere seen in the lungs of rats exposed to either 500 or 1000 ppm trichloroethylene. Isolatedmouse lung Clara cells were shown to metabolize trichloroethylene to chloral;trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid. Chloral was the major metabolite …,Chemico-biological interactions,1992,70
The role of glutathione conjugation in the development of kidney tumours in rats exposed to trichloroethylene,TJMKJRJ Green; J Dow; MK Ellis; JR Foster; J Odum,Abstract Trichloroethylene is metabolised to a very minor extent (< 0.01% of the dose) byconjugation with glutathione; a metabolic pathway which leads to the formation of S-(1; 2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC); a bacterial mutagen and nephrotoxin activated by the renalenzyme β-lyase. The role of this metabolic pathway in the development of the nephrotoxicityand subsequent tumour formation seen in rats exposed to trichloroethylene has beenevaluated. The pathway has been assessed quantitatively in vivo in rats; and in rats; miceand humans in vitro. Trichloroethylene was found to be a very weak nephrotoxin. There wasno evidence of morphological change in the kidneys and only small increases inbiochemical markers of kidney damage in rats dosed with 2000 mg/kg trichloroethylene bygavage for 42 days.

For this reason; we present a formal framework foranswering queries on data with annotations from commutative semirings; and propose acomprehensive provenance representation based on semirings of polynomials. We extendthese considerations to XQuery views over annotated; unordered XML data; and show thatthe semiring framework suffices for a large positive fragment of XQuery applied to such data.Finally; we conclude with a brief overview of the large body of work that builds upon these …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2012,62
Proterozoic–Cambrian detrital zircon and monazite ages from the Anakie Inlier; central Queensland: Grenville and Pacific‐Gondwana signatures,Christopher Lloyd Fergusson; Paul Francis Carr; CM Fanning; TJ Green,Abstract The Anakie Metamorphic Group is a complexly deformed; dominantlymetasedimentary succession in central Queensland. Metamorphic cooling is constrained toca 500 Ma by previously published K–Ar ages. Detrital-zircon SHRIMP U–Pb ages fromthree samples of greenschist facies quartz-rich psammites (Bathampton Metamorphics);west of Clermont; are predominantly in the age range 1300–1000 Ma (65–75%). They showthat a Grenville-aged orogenic belt must have existed in northeastern Australia; which isconsistent with the discovery of a potential Grenville source farther north. The youngestdetrital zircons in these samples are ca 580 Ma; indicating that deposition may have been asold as latest Neoproterozoic.

Experimental noise filtering by quantum control,A Soare; H Ball; D Hayes; J Sastrawan; MC Jarratt; JJ McLoughlin; X Zhen; TJ Green; MJ Biercuk,Abstract Extrinsic interference is routinely faced in systems engineering; and a commonsolution is to rely on a broad class of filtering techniques to afford stability to intrinsicallyunstable systems or isolate particular signals from a noisy background. Experimentalistsleading the development of a new generation of quantum-enabled technologies similarlyencounter time-varying noise in realistic laboratory settings. They face substantialchallenges in either suppressing such noise for high-fidelity quantum operations 1 orcontrollably exploiting it in quantum-enhanced sensing 2; 3; 4 or system identification tasks5; 6; due to a lack of efficient; validated approaches to understanding and predictingquantum dynamics in the presence of realistic time-varying noise.

Arbitrary quantum control of qubits in the presence of universal noise,Todd J Green; Jarrah Sastrawan; Hermann Uys; Michael J Biercuk,Abstract. We address the problem of deriving analytic expressions for calculating universaldecoherence-induced errors in qubits undergoing arbitrary; unitary; time-dependentquantum control protocols. We show that the fidelity of a control operation may be expressedin terms of experimentally relevant spectral characteristics of the noise and of the control;over all Cartesian directions. We formulate control matrices in the time domain to capture theeffects of piecewise-constant control; and convert them to generalized Fourierdomain filterfunctions. These generalized filter functions may be derived for complex temporallymodulated control protocols; accounting for susceptibility to rotations of the qubit state vectorin three dimensions. Taken together; we show that this framework provides acomputationally efficient means to calculate the effects of universal noise on arbitrary …,New Journal of Physics,2013,51
High-order noise filtering in nontrivial quantum logic gates,Todd Green; Hermann Uys; Michael J Biercuk,Abstract Treating the effects of a time-dependent classical dephasing environment duringquantum logic operations poses a theoretical challenge; as the application of noncommutingcontrol operations gives rise to both dephasing and depolarization errors that must beaccounted for in order to understand total average error rates. We develop a treatmentbased on effective Hamiltonian theory that allows us to efficiently model the effect ofclassical noise on nontrivial single-bit quantum logic operations composed of arbitrarycontrol sequences. We present a general method to calculate the ensemble-averagedentanglement fidelity to arbitrary order in terms of noise filter functions; and provide explicitexpressions to fourth order in the noise strength. In the weak noise limit we derive explicitfilter functions for a broad class of piecewise-constant control sequences; and use them to …,Physical review letters,2012,50

The task of building and maintaining enterprise software istedious and laborious; applications are cumbersome for end-users; and adapting to newcomputing hardware and infrastructures is difficult.

Designing a practical high-fidelity long-time quantum memory,Kaveh Khodjasteh; Jarrah Sastrawan; David Hayes; Todd J Green; Michael J Biercuk; Lorenza Viola,Abstract Quantum memory is a central component for quantum information processingdevices; and will be required to provide high-fidelity storage of arbitrary states; long storagetimes and small access latencies. Despite growing interest in applying physical-layer error-suppression strategies to boost fidelities; it has not previously been possible to meet suchcompeting demands with a single approach. Here we use an experimentally validatedtheoretical framework to identify periodic repetition of a high-order dynamical decouplingsequence as a systematic strategy to meet these challenges. We provide analytic bounds—validated by numerical calculations—on the characteristics of the relevant controlsequences and show that a 'stroboscopic saturation'of coherence; or coherence plateau;can be engineered; even in the presence of experimental imperfection. This permits high …,Nature Communications,2013,46
Robustness of composite pulses to time-dependent control noise,Chingiz Kabytayev; Todd J Green; Kaveh Khodjasteh; Michael J Biercuk; Lorenza Viola; Kenneth R Brown,Abstract We study the performance of composite pulses in the presence of time-varyingcontrol noise on a single qubit. These protocols; originally devised only to correct for static;systematic errors; are shown to be robust to time-dependent non-Markovian noise in thecontrol field up to frequencies as high as∼ 10% of the Rabi frequency. Our study combinesa generalized filter-function approach with asymptotic dc-limit calculations to give a simpleanalytic framework for error analysis applied to a number of composite-pulse sequencesrelevant to nuclear magnetic resonance as well as quantum information experiments.Results include examination of recently introduced concatenated composite pulses anddynamically corrected gates; demonstrating equivalent first-order suppression of time-dependent fluctuations in amplitude and/or detuning; as appropriate for the sequence in …,Physical Review A,2014,39
Reconcilable differences,Todd J Green; Zachary G Ives; Val Tannen,Abstract In this paper we study a problem motivated by the management of changes indatabases. It turns out that several such change scenarios; eg; the separately studiedproblems of view maintenance (propagation of data changes) and view adaptation(propagation of view definition changes) can be unified as instances of query reformulationusing views provided that support for the relational difference operator exists in the contextof query reformulation. Exact query reformulation using views in positive relationallanguages is well understood; and has a variety of applications in query optimization anddata sharing. Unfortunately; most questions about queries become undecidable in thepresence of difference (or negation); whether we use the foundational set semantics or themore practical bag semantics.

The name is taken from the Thomson River that flows within theMesozoic cover parallel to the indicated structural trend of the belt.

Sensitivity of papilledema as a sign of shunt failure in children,Sayeda Nazir; Mark O'Brien; Nazer H Qureshi; Lamonda Slape; TJ Green; Paul H Phillips,Purpose Papilledema is considered one of the cardinal ophthalmologic signs of shuntfailure. However; the prevalence of papilledema in children with shunt malfunction has notbeen systematically investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity ofpapilledema as a sign of shunt failure in children. Methods A prospective evaluation wasundertaken of all children (n= 29;< 19 years of age) with surgically confirmed shuntmalfunction who were treated at Arkansas Children's Hospital between July 2007 and April2008. Each child had a dilated fundus examination and/or RetCam photograph while underanesthesia immediately before shunt repair. The optic disk was evaluated for the presenceof papilledema and pallor. Intracranial pressure was measured during surgical shunt repairat the discretion of the neurosurgeon.

Win-move is coordination-free (sometimes),Daniel Zinn; Todd J Green; Bertram Ludäscher,Abstract In a recent paper by Hellerstein [15]; a tight relationship was conjectured betweenthe number of strata of a Datalog¬ program and the number of" coordination stages"required for its distributed computation. Indeed; Ameloot et al.[9] showed that a query can becomputed by a coordination-free relational transducer network iff it is monotone; thusanswering in the affirmative a variant of Hellerstein's CALM conjecture; based on a particulardefinition of coordination-free computation. In this paper; we present three additional modelsfor declarative networking. In these variants; relational transducers have limited access tothe way data is distributed. This variation allows transducer networks to compute morequeries in a coordination-free manner: eg; a transducer can check whether a ground atom Aover the input schema is in the" scope" of the local node; and then send either A or¬ A to …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,29

Late Neoproterozoic passive margin of East Gondwana: geochemical constraints from the Anakie Inlier; central Queensland; Australia,Christopher L Fergusson; R Offler; TJ Green,Abstract Development of the East Gondwana passive margin and when it occurred areconstrained by the composition of low-grade mafic schists and U–Pb ages of detrital zirconsin psammitic schists from the Bathampton Metamorphics in the Anakie Inlier of centralQueensland.

Collaborative data sharing via update exchange and provenance,Grigoris Karvounarakis; Todd J Green; Zachary G Ives; Val Tannen,Abstract Recent work [Ives et al. 2005] proposed a new class of systems for supporting datasharing among scientific and other collaborations: this new collaborative data sharingsystem connects heterogeneous logical peers using a network of schema mappings. Eachpeer has a locally controlled and edited database instance; but wants to incorporate relateddata from other peers as well. To achieve this; every peer's data and updates propagatealong the mappings to the other peers. However; this operation; termed update exchange; isfiltered by trust conditions—expressing what data and sources a peer judges to beauthoritative—which may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order to support suchfiltering; updates carry provenance information.

Such systems are particularly susceptible to residual qubit-oscillator entanglementat the conclusion of a gate period that reduces the fidelity of the target entangling operation.We demonstrate how the exclusive use of discrete shifts in the phase of the field moderatingthe qubit-oscillator interaction is sufficient to both ensure multiple oscillator modes aredecoupled and to suppress the effects of fluctuations in the driving field. This approach isamenable to a wide variety of technical implementations including geometric phase gates insuperconducting qubits and the Molmer-Sorensen gate for trapped ions. We presentdetailed example protocols tailored to trapped-ion experiments and demonstrate that our …,Physical review letters,2015,15
Geochemical and geochronological evidence that the North-East Greenland ultrahigh-pressure terrane is Laurentian crust,Jane A Gilotti; William C McClelland,Abstract Coesite-bearing gneiss and eclogite constitute the North-East Greenland ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane on a small island located at approximately 78° 00′ N; 18° 54′ Win the North Atlantic Ocean. The island lies on the eastern margin of the much largerCaledonian North-East Greenland high-pressure (HP) eclogite province. This eclogiteprovince is composed of juvenile Paleoproterozoic crust dominated by 1.85–2.0-Ga calc-alkaline magmatic-arc rocks that were deformed and then intruded by a suite of anorogenicgranites at approximately 1.75 Ga. These orthogneisses can be traced to the foreland of theCaledonian orogen before they disappear under the ice sheet and thus are taken to be partof Laurentia. Whole-rock and trace-element geochemistry from six UHP gneissesdemonstrate that the samples represent the more mafic parts of the calc-alkaline arc seen …,The Journal of Geology,2011,15
Cellular automata,Todd J Green; Xyleme Sa; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract. We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on anXML stream. Our main contribution consists in showing that Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a throughputof about 5.4 MB/s; independent of the number of XPath expressions (up to 1;000;000 in ourtests). The major problem we face is that of the size of the DFA. Since the number of statesgrows exponentially with the number of XPath expressions; it was previously believed thatDFAs cannot be used to process large sets of expressions. We make a theoretical analysisof the number of states in the DFA resulting from XPath expressions; and consider both thecase when it is constructed eagerly; and when it is constructed lazily. Our analysis indicatesthat; when the automaton is constructed lazily; and under certain assumptions about the …,*,1993,15
Population inversion in an optically pumped single quantum well,Timoghy J Green; Wen Xu,An optically pumped intersubband laser generator is proposed in which the continuumstates above an Al 0.2 Ga 0.8 As–GaAs–Al 0.2 Ga 0.8 As single quantum well with a width ofL= 17 nm serve as the highest level in a four-level laser system. The design allows muchgreater flexibility in the choice of pumping source and simplifies considerably the devicefabrication.

Dynamical decoupling sequences for multi-qubit dephasing suppression and long-time quantum memory,Gerardo A Paz-Silva; Seung-Woo Lee; Todd J Green; Lorenza Viola,Abstract We consider a class of multi-qubit dephasing models that combine classical noisesources and linear coupling to a bosonic environment; and are controlled by arbitrarysequences of dynamical decoupling pulses. Building on a general transfer filter-functionframework for open-loop control; we provide an exact representation of the controlleddynamics for arbitrary stationary non-Gaussian classical and quantum noise statistics; withanalytical expressions emerging when all dephasing sources are Gaussian. This exactcharacterization is used to establish two main results. First; we construct multi-qubitsequences that ensure maximum high-order error suppression in both the time andfrequency domain and that can be exponentially more efficient than existing ones in terms oftotal pulse number. Next; we show how long-time multi-qubit storage may be achieved by …,New Journal of Physics,2016,9
Tectonic implications of early paleozoic metamorphism in the Anakie Inlier; Central Queensland; Australia,R Offler; G Phillips; CL Fergusson; TJ Green,Abstract Well-defined metamorphic zones are developed in pelitic and psammitic rocks ofthe Late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Anakie Metamorphic Group of the Anakie Inlier; centralQueensland. They are defined by the incoming of biotite; garnet; and andalusite; with orwithout staurolite. Mineral assemblages indicate that low pressure–high temperaturemetamorphism is associated with D1; medium pressure–high temperature metamorphismwith D2; and retrograde; low pressure–low temperature metamorphism with D3. A mean bcell parameter of 9.035 obtained from K-white micas in the lowest-grade rocks suggestsupper intermediate pressure conditions during D2.

Long-time low-latency quantum memory by dynamical decoupling,Kaveh Khodjasteh; Jarrah Sastrawan; David Hayes; Todd J Green; Michael J Biercuk; Lorenza Viola,Abstract: Quantum memory is a central component for quantum information processingdevices; and will be required to provide high-fidelity storage of arbitrary states; long storagetimes and small access latencies. Despite growing interest in applying physical-layer error-suppression strategies to boost fidelities; it has not previously been possible to meet suchcompeting demands with a single approach. Here we use an experimentally validatedtheoretical framework to identify periodic repetition of a high-order dynamical decouplingsequence as a systematic strategy to meet these challenges. We provide analytic bounds-validated by numerical calculations-on the characteristics of the relevant control sequencesand show that a" stroboscopic saturation" of coherence; or coherence plateau; can beengineered; even in the presence of experimental imperfection.

Recomputing materialized instances after changes to mappings and data,Todd J Green; Zachary G Ives,A major challenge faced by today's information systems is that of evolution as data usageevolves or new data resources become available. Modern organizations sometimesexchange data with one another via declarative mappings among their databases; as indata exchange and collaborative data sharing systems. Such mappings are frequentlyrevised and refined as new data becomes available; new cross-reference tables arecreated; and corrections are made. A fundamental question is how to handle changes tothese mapping definitions; when the organizations each materialize the results of applyingthe mappings to the available data. We consider how to incrementally recompute thesedatabase instances in this setting; reusing (if possible) previously computed instances tospeed up computation.

Collaborative data sharing with mappings and provenance,Todd J Green,Abstract A key challenge in science today involves integrating data from databasesmanaged by different collaborating scientists. In this dissertation; we develop thefoundations and applications of collaborative data sharing systems (CDSSs); which addressthis challenge. A CDSS allows collaborators to define loose confederations ofheterogeneous databases; relating them through schema mappings that establish how datashould flow from one site to the next. In addition to simply propagating data along themappings; it is critical to record data provenance (annotations describing where and howdata originated) and to support policies allowing scientists to specify whose data they trust;and when. Since a large data sharing confederation is certain to evolve over time; the CDSSmust also efficiently handle incremental changes to data; schemas; and mappings.,*,2009,2

We consider the problem of checking equivalence of conjunctive queries withinequalities under bag (multiset) semantics. The problem is known to be decidable inPsPACE and as hard as graph isomorphism; but its exact complexity remains open. Weintroduce a natural restriction based on what we call the symmetry degree of queries; andshow that when the symmetry degree is bounded by a fixed polynomial in the size of thequery; the equivalence problem is in Πp,AMW,2011,1

Phase-modulated spin-motional decoupling with trapped ions,Claire Edmunds; Alistair Milne; Sandeep Mavadia; Todd Green; Michael Biercuk,Abstract We present a technique to minimize residual spin-motional entanglement after aphonon-mediated entangling gate in trapped 171 Yb+ ion qubits. Phonon-mediated gates;such as the Mølmer-Sørensen gate; engineer spin-spin entanglement by coupling the qubitsto their collective modes of motion. Consequently; a major experimental limitation is residualmotional entanglement at the conclusion of the gate; resulting in a degradation of the finalspin state purity. Our work utilizes phase-modulated pulse sequences to decouple the qubitsfrom multiple motional modes simultaneously at a variable gate time. In addition; we extendthis technique to the suppression of time-dependent noise using concatenated gatesequences; which allows for the recovery of a higher purity spin state. Using a single;experimentally controllable modulation parameter we are able to achieve more optimal …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2016,*
A System For High Flexibility Entangling Gates With Trapped Ions,Alistair Milne; Claire Edmunds; Sandeep Mavadia; Todd Green; Michael Biercuk,Abstract Trapped ion qubits may be entangled via coupling to shared modes of motion usingspin-dependent forces generated by optical fields. Residual qubit-motional coupling at theconclusion of the entangling operation is the dominant source of infidelity in this type of gate.For synchronously entangling increasing numbers of ions; longer gate times are required tominimise this residual coupling. We present a scheme that enables the state of each qubit tobe simultaneously decoupled from all motional modes in an arbitrarily chosen gate time;increasing the gate fidelity and scalability. This is achieved by implementing discrete phaseshifts in the optical field moderating the entangling operation. We describe an experimentalsystem based on trapped ytterbium ions and demonstrate this scheme for two-qubitentangling gates on ytterbium ion pairs.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2016,*

Robustness of composite pulse sequences to time-dependent noise,Chingiz Kabytayev; Todd J Green; Kaveh Khodjasteh; Lorenza Viola; Michael J Biercuk; Kenneth R Brown,Abstract Quantum control protocols can minimize the effect of noise sources that reduce thequality of quantum operations. Originally developed for NMR; composite pulse sequencescorrect for unknown static control errors. We study these compensating pulses in the generalcase of time-varying Gaussian control noise using a filter-function approach and detailednumerics. Three different noise models were considered in this work: amplitude noise;detuning noise and simultaneous presence of both noises. Pulse sequences are shown tobe robust to noise up to frequencies as high as~ 10% of the Rabi frequency. Robustness ofpulses designed for amplitude noise is explained using a geometric picture that naturallyfollows from filter function. We also discuss future directions including new pulses correctingfor noise of certain frequency.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2014,*

On the one hand spin-echotechniques have the advantage of simplicity; while on the other optimized continuousmodulation is expected to achieve better performance results at the cost complexity.
