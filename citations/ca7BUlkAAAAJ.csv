Cooled radiofrequency denervation for treatment of sacroiliac joint pain: two-year results from 20 cases,Kok-Yuen Ho; Mohamed Abdul Hadi; Koravee Pasutharnchat; Kian-Hian Tan,Background Sacroiliac joint pain is a common cause of chronic low back pain. Differenttechniques for radiofrequency denervation of the sacroiliac joint have been used to treat thiscondition. However; results have been inconsistent because the variable sensory supply tothe sacroiliac joint is difficult to disrupt completely using conventional radiofrequency.Cooled radiofrequency is a novel technique that uses internally cooled radiofrequencyprobes to enlarge lesion size; thereby increasing the chance of completely denervating thesacroiliac joint. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cooledradiofrequency denervation using the SInergy™ cooled radiofrequency system for sacroiliacjoint pain. Methods The charts of 20 patients with chronic sacroiliac joint pain who hadundergone denervation using the SInergy™ cooled radiofrequency system were …,Journal of pain research,2013,26
Measurement of cardiac output using Physio Flow with different positions of electrode placement.,KH Tan; FO Lai; NC Hwang,Abstract INTRODUCTION: Physio Flow is a non-invasive impedance cardiograph devicethat measures cardiac output. Recommended electrode placements involve six electrodes;including two near the xiphisternum (Z3 and Z4/ECG3/neutral). This study aims to evaluate ifchanging the positions of these two leads to the left fourth and fifth intercostal spaces alongthe mid-axillary line results in a change in the cardiac output measurement. METHODS: Thiswas a prospective; controlled; crossover; paired study of 30 patients where electrodes wereplaced in the recommended positions and cardiac output (CO1) obtained after two minutes.The second cardiac output (CO2) was then obtained with the electrodes Z3 andZ4/ECG3/neutral repositioned at the left mid-axillary line at the fourth and fifth intercostalspaces. The final step involved switching the Z3 and Z4/ECG3/neutral leads back to the …,Singapore medical journal,2006,19
