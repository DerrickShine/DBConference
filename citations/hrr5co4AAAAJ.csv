Anatomy of a native XML base management system,Thorsten Fiebig; Sven Helmer; C-C Kanne; Guido Moerkotte; Julia Neumann; Robert Schiele; Till Westmann,Abstract. Several alternatives to manage large XML document collections exist; ranging fromfile systems over relational or other database systems to specifically tailored XML basemanagement systems. In this paper we give a tour of Natix; a database management systemdesigned from scratch for storing and processing XML data. Contrary to the common beliefthat management of XML data is just another application for traditional databases likerelational systems; we illustrate how almost every component in a database system isaffected in terms of adequacy and performance. We show how to design and optimize areassuch as storage; transaction management-comprising recovery and multi-usersynchronization-as well as query processing for XML.,The VLDB Journal,2002,269
The implementation and performance of compressed databases,Till Westmann; Donald Kossmann; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract In this paper; we show how compression can be integrated into a relationaldatabase system. Specifically; we describe how the storage manager; the query executionengine; and the query optimizer of a database system can be extended to deal withcompressed data. Our main result is that compression can significantly improve theresponse time of queries if very light-weight compression techniques are used. We willpresent such light-weight compression techniques and give the results of running the TPC-Dbenchmark on a so compressed database and a non-compressed database using theAODB database system; an experimental database system that was developed at theUniversities of Mannheim and Passau. Our benchmark results demonstrate thatcompression indeed offers high performance gains (up to 50%) for IO-intensive queries …,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,195
Full-fledged algebraic XPath processing in Natix,Matthias Brantner; Sven Helmer; C-C Kanne; Guido Moerkotte,We present the first complete translation of XPath into an algebra; paving the way for acomprehensive; state-of-the-art XPath (and later on; XQuery) compiler based on algebraicoptimization techniques. Our translation includes all XPath features such as nestedexpressions; position-based predicates and node-set functions. The translated algebraicexpressions can be executed using the proven; scalable; iterator-based approach; as wedemonstrate in form of a corresponding physical algebra in our native XML DBMS Natix. Afirst glance at performance results shows that even without further optimization of theexpressions; we provide a competitive evaluation technique for XPath queries.,Data Engineering; 2005.

A performance study of four index structures for set-valued attributes of low cardinality,Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract. The efficient retrieval of data items on set-valued attributes is an important researchtopic that has attracted little attention so far. We studied and modified four index structures(sequential signature files; signature trees; extendible signature hashing; and inverted files)for a fast retrieval of sets with low cardinality. We compared the index structures byimplementing them and subjecting them to extensive experiments; investigating theinfluence of query set size; database size; domain size; and data distribution (synthetic andreal). The results of the experiments clearly indicate that inverted files exhibit the best overallbehavior of all tested index structures.,The VLDB Journal,2003,79
Evaluating lock-based protocols for cooperation on XML documents,Sven Helmer; Carl-Christian Kanne; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract We discuss four different core protocols for synchronizing access to andmodifications of XML document collections. These core protocols synchronize structuretraversals and modifications. They are meant to be integrated into a native XML basemanagement System (XBMS) and are based on two phase locking. We also demonstratethe different degrees of cooperation that are possible with these protocols by variousexperimental results. Furthermore; we also discuss extensions of these core protocols to full-fledged protocols. Further; we show how to achieve a higher degree of concurrency byexploiting the semantics expressed in Document Type Definitions (DTDs).,ACM SIGMOD Record,2004,72
Measuring the structural similarity of semistructured documents using entropy,Sven Helmer,Abstract We propose a technique for measuring the structural similarity of semistructureddocuments based on entropy. After extracting the structural information from two documentswe use either Ziv-Lempel encoding or Ziv-Merhav crossparsing to determine the entropyand consequently the similarity between the documents. To the best of our knowledge; thisis the first true linear-time approach for evaluating structural similarity. In an experimentalevaluation we demonstrate that the results of our algorithm in terms of clustering quality areon a par with or even better than existing approaches.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,67
Affordable and energy-efficient cloud computing clusters: The bolzano raspberry pi cloud cluster experiment,Pekka Abrahamsson; Sven Helmer; Nattakarn Phaphoom; Lorenzo Nicolodi; Nick Preda; Lorenzo Miori; Matteo Angriman; Juha Rikkila; Xiaofeng Wang; Karim Hamily; Sara Bugoloni,We present our ongoing work building a Raspberry Pi cluster consisting of 300 nodes. Theunique characteristics of this single board computer pose several challenges; but also offera number of interesting opportunities. On the one hand; a single Raspberry Pi can bepurchased cheaply and has a low power consumption; which makes it possible to create anaffordable and energy-efficient cluster. On the other hand; it lacks in computing power; whichmakes it difficult to run computationally intensive software on it. Nevertheless; by combininga large number of Raspberries into a cluster; this drawback can be (partially) offset. Here wereport on the first important steps of creating our cluster: how to set up and configure thehardware and the system software; and how to monitor and maintain the system.

Optimized translation of XPath into algebraic expressions parameterized by programs containing navigational primitives,Sven Helmer; C-C Kanne,We propose a new approach for the efficient evaluation of XPath expressions. This isimportant; since XPath is not only used as a simple; stand-alone query language; but is alsoan essential ingredient of XQuery and XSLT. The main idea of our approach is to translateXPath into algebraic expressions parameterized with programs. These programs are mainlybuilt from navigational primitives like accessing the first child or the next sibling. The goals ofthe approach are: 1) to enable pipelined evaluation; 2) to avoid producing duplicate(intermediate) result nodes; 3) to visit as few document nodes as possible; and 4) to avoidvisiting nodes more than once. This improves the existing approaches; because our methodis highly efficient.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2002. WISE 2002. Proceedings of the Third International Conference on,2002,54
Strategies for query unnesting in XML databases,Norman May; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract Queries formulated in a nested way are very common in XQuery. Unfortunately;their evaluation is usually very inefficient when done in a straightforward fashion. Wepresent a framework for handling nested queries that is based on unnesting the queries afterhaving translated them into an algebra. We not only present a collection of algebraicequivalences; but also supply a strategy on how to use them effectively. The full potential ofthe approach is demonstrated by applying our rewrites to actual queries and showing thatperformance gains of several orders of magnitude are possible.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,43
Diag-Join: An opportunistic join algorithm for 1: N relationships,Sven Helmer; Till Westmann; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract: Time of creation is one of the predominant (often implicit) clustering strategiesfound not only in Data Warehouse systems: line items are created together with theircorresponding order; objects are created together with their subparts and so on. The newlycreated data is then appended to the existing data. We present a new join algorithm; calledDiag-Join; which exploits time-of-creation clustering. The performance evaluation reveals itssuperiority over standard join algorithms like nested-loop join and GRACE hash join. Wealso present an analytical cost model for Diag-Join.,*,1997,36

Evaluating different approaches for indexing fuzzy sets,Sven Helmer,Abstract Providing efficient query processing in database systems is one step towardsgaining acceptance of such systems by end users. We propose several techniques forindexing fuzzy sets in databases to improve the query evaluation performance. Three of thepresented access methods are based on superimposed coding; while the fourth relies oninverted files. The efficiency of these techniques was evaluated experimentally. We presentresults from these experiments; which clearly show the superiority of the inverted files.,Fuzzy Sets and Systems,2003,18
A Container-based Edge Cloud PaaS Architecture based on Raspberry Pi Clusters,Claus Pahl; Sven Helmer; Lorenzo Miori; Julian Sanin; Brian Lee,Cloud technology is moving towards multi-cloud environments with the inclusion of variousdevices. Cloud and IoT integration resulting in so-called edge cloud and fog computing hasstarted. This requires the combination of data centre technologies with much moreconstrained devices; but still using virtualised solutions to deal with scalability; flexibility andmulti-tenancy concerns. Lightweight virtualisation solutions do exist for this architecturalsetting with smaller; but still virtualised devices to provide application and platformtechnology as services.

Reasoning in event-based distributed systems,Sven Helmer; Alexandra Poulovassilis; Fatos Xhafa,With the rapid expansion of the Internet over the last 20 years; event-based distributedsystems are playing an increasingly important role in a broad range of application domains;including enterprise management; environmental monitoring; information dissemination;finance; pervasive systems; autonomic computing; collaborative working and learning; andgeo-spatial systems. Many different architectures; languages and technologies are beingused for implementing event-based distributed systems; and much of the development hasbeen undertaken independently by different communities. However; a common factor is anever-increasing complexity.

Fault-tolerant compression algorithms for delay-sensitive sensor networks with unreliable links,Alexandre Guitton; Niki Trigoni; Sven Helmer,Abstract We compare the performance of standard data compression techniques in thepresence of communication failures. Their performance is inferior to sending data withoutcompression when the packet loss rate of a link is above 10%. We have developed fault-tolerant compression algorithms for sensor networks that are robust against packet loss andachieve low delays in data decoding; thus being particularly suitable for time-criticalapplications. We show the advantage of our technique by providing results from ourextensive experimental evaluation using real sensor datasets.,International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,2008,15
Algebraic optimization of nested XPath expressions,Matthias Brantner; C-C Kanne; Guido Moerkotte; Sven Helmer,The XPath language incorporates powerful primitives for formulating queries containingnested subexpressions which are existentially or universally quantified. However; even thebest published approaches for evaluating XPath have unsatisfactory performance whenapplied to nested queries. We examine optimization techniques that unnest complex XPathqueries. For this purpose; we classify XPath expressions particularly with regard toproperties that are relevant for unnesting. We present algebraic equivalences that transformnested expressions into unnested expressions. In our experiments we compare theevaluation times with existing XPath evaluators and the naive evaluation.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,15
Index structures for efficiently accessing fuzzy data including cost models and measurements,Birgit Boss; Sven Helmer,Abstract Recently; the call for database management systems (DBMS) with uncertaintycapabilities is getting stronger. Many of the existing approaches to modeling uncertainty indatabase management systems are based on the theory of fuzzy sets. High performance is anecessary precondition for the acceptance of such systems by end users. However;performance issues have been quite neglected in research on fuzzy DBMS so far. In thisarticle they are addressed explicitly. We propose new index structures for fuzzy DBMSbased on the well known technique of superimposed coding together with detailed costmodels. The correctness of the cost models as well as the efficiency of the index structuresproposed is validated by a number of measurements on experimental fuzzy databases.,Fuzzy Sets and Systems,1999,14
Measuring structural similarity of semistructured data based on information-theoretic approaches,Sven Helmer; Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen,Abstract We propose and experimentally evaluate different approaches for measuring thestructural similarity of semistructured documents based on information-theoretic concepts.Common to all approaches is a two-step procedure: first; we extract and linearize thestructural information from documents; and then; we use similarity measures that are basedon; respectively; Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon entropy to determine the distancebetween the documents. Compared to other approaches; we are able to achieve a linear run-time complexity and demonstrate in an experimental evaluation that the results of ourtechnique in terms of clustering quality are on a par with or even better than those of other;slower approaches.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,13
Index structures for databases containing data items with set-valued attributes,Sven Helmer,Abstract: We introduce two new hash-based index structures to index set-valued attributes.Both are able to support subset and superset queries. Analytical cost models for the newindex structures as well as for the two existing index structures; sequential signature file andRussian Doll Tree; are presented and experimentally validated. Using the validated costmodel; we express the performance of all four index structures in terms of the performance ofthe sequential signature file. This allows a direct analytical comparison of their performance.Last; we report on our benchmark results comparing the real performance of all four indexstructures. We especially investigate their performance for skewed data.,*,1997,12
Efficient Itinerary Planning with Category Constraints,Paolo Bolzoni; Sven Helmer; Kevin Wellenzohn; Johann Gamper; Periklis Andritsos,Abstract We propose a more realistic approach to trip planning for tourist applications byadding category information to points of interest (POIs). This makes it easier for tourists toformulate their preferences by stating constraints on categories rather than individual POIs.However; solving this problem is not just a matter of extending existing algorithms. In ourapproach we exploit the fact that POIs are usually not evenly distributed but tend to appearin clusters. We develop a group of efficient algorithms based on clustering with guaranteedtheoretical bounds. We also evaluate our algorithms experimentally; using real-world datasets; showing that in practice the results are better than the theoretical guarantees and veryclose to the optimal solution.,22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL Int.

On the optimal ordering of maps and selections under factorization,Thomas Neumann; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,The query optimizer of a database system is confronted with two aspects when handlinguser-defined functions (UDFs) in query predicates: the vast differences in evaluation costsbetween UDFs (and other functions) and multiple calls of the same (expensive) UDF Theformer is dealt with by ordering the evaluation of the predicates optimally; the latter byidentifying common subexpressions and thereby avoiding costly recomputation. Currentapproaches order n predicates optimally (neglecting factorization) in O (nlogn). Their resultmay deviate significantly from the optimal solution under factorization. We formalize theproblem of finding optimal orderings under factorization and prove that it is NP-hard.Furthermore; we show how to improve on the run time of the brute-force algorithm (whichcomputes all possible orderings) by presenting different enhanced algorithms.

A robust scheme for multilevel extendible hashing,Sven Helmer; Thomas Neumann; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract Dynamic hashing; while surpassing other access methods for uniformly distributeddata; usually performs badly for non-uniformly distributed data. We propose a robust schemefor multi-level extendible hashing; allowing efficient processing of skewed data as well asuniformly distributed data.

-Estimating the Output Cardinality of Partial Preaggregation with a Measure of Clusteredness,Sven Helmer; Thomas Neumann; Guido Moerkotte,This chapter introduces a new parameter; the clusteredness of data; and shows how it canbe used for estimating the output cardinality of a partial preaggregation operator. Estimatingthe output cardinality of partial preaggregation (PPA) accurately is a necessary prerequisitefor a query optimizer to reach a decision on applying it. Several factors influence the qualityof an early aggregation step: the number of groups; the number of tuples in the input; thedistributions of the group sizes; the size of the buffer; the buffer replacement strategy used bythe algorithm and; the clusteredness of the data. Previous analyses of PPA did not considerthe clusteredness of the data; but assumed randomized data. The quality of theapproximations was demonstrated by thorough experiments. The experimental results arevery promising; due to the high accuracy of the cardinality estimation based on the …,*,2003,11
A visual query language for HEP analysis,Vasco Amaral; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Pheasant is the first proposal for a declarative domain specific visual query language forHEP data analysis. It has been designed based on our experience dealing with Hera-Bevent data and query patterns. Its main goal is to allow the physicist to describe the decayselection queries by means of visual operators; to be run against the experiments' existingstorage bases and analysis frameworks. Our visual language aims to be a simple-to-use toolwith which a user can express complex decay queries in an easy way with reducedprogramming efforts. Indeed; the user does not have to deal with intricacies like physicalstorage details. In our communication we will describe how we determined the visualprimitives by looking at the query patterns. We will also describe our language in an informalmanner in terms of syntax; semantics; and example queries.,Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record; 2003 IEEE,2003,10

By giving example query evaluation plans we show the increasedpossibilities for the query optimizer.,Technical reports,2002,9
Formally specifying the syntax and semantics of a visual query language for the domain of high energy physics data analysis,Vasco Amaral; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Currently; physicists working in high energy physics experiments have to write their queriesin general purpose programming languages using complex frameworks for accessing thedata. This distracts them from their actual work; namely data analysis; and reduces theirproductivity significantly. We have improved this situation by designing and implementingthe first visual query language specific to this domain. Our goal was to provide a toolenabling physicists to formulate queries in their own terms and notation. In this paper wefocus on the formal definition of our visual query language (including syntax and semantics).The meanings of our operators are well-defined by means of translational semantics; ie; wemap all elements of our language to a well-known NF2 algebra. We conclude with adiscussion of the advantages of this formal design approach.,Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing; 2005 IEEE Symposium on,2005,8

This scheme avoids exponential directory growth for skeweddata and thus generates a much smaller number of subqueries for query sets (so far fast-growing directories have prohibited hash-based index structures for set-valued retrieval).We demonstrate the advantages of our scheme over regular extendible hashing bothanalytically and experimentally. We also implemented a prototype and briefly summarize theresults of our experimental evaluation.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,6

Integrating star and snowflake schemas in data warehouses,Georgia Garani; Sven Helmer,Abstract A fundamental issue encountered by the research community of data warehouses(DWs) is the modeling of data. In this paper; a new design is proposed; named the starnestschema; for the logical modeling of DWs. Using nested methodology; data semantics can beexplicitly represented. Part of the design involves providing a translation mechanism fromthe star/snowflake schemas to a nested representation. The novel schema proposed in thispaper is accomplished by converting the fact-dimension schema to a fact-nested dimensionschema. The transformation of the denormalized dimension tables to nested dimensiontables increases the efficiency of query execution by reducing the number of tuplesaccessed for query retrieval since dimensional attributes can be used directly in the Group-by clause.

Thismight explain the renewed interest in the join ordering problem. Although many join orderingtechniques have been invented and benchmarked over the last years; little is known on theactual effectiveness of the developed methods and the cases where they are bound to fail.The problem attacked is the discovery of parameters and their qualitative influence on thecomplexity of single problem instances and on the effectiveness of join ordering techniquesincluding search procedures; heuristics; and probabilistic algorithms.

Inferring offline hierarchical ties from online social networks,Mohammad Jaber; Peter T Wood; Panagiotis Papapetrou; Sven Helmer,Abstract Social networks can represent many different types of relationships between actors;some explicit and some implicit. For example; email communications between users may berepresented explicitly in a network; while managerial relationships may not. In this paper wefocus on analyzing explicit interactions among actors in order to detect hierarchical socialrelationships that may be implicit. We start by employing three well-known ranking-basedmethods; PageRank; Degree Centrality; and Rooted-PageRank (RPR) to infer such implicitrelationships from interactions between actors. Then we propose two novel approacheswhich take into account the time-dimension of interactions in the process of detectinghierarchical ties.

An impact ordering approach for indexing fuzzy sets,Carlos D Barranco; Sven Helmer,Abstract We propose an approach for indexing fuzzy data based on inverted files thatspeeds up retrieval considerably by stopping the traversal of postings lists early. This ispossible because the entries in the postings lists are organized in a way that guarantees thatthere are no matching items beyond a certain point in a list. Consequently; we can reducethe number of false positives significantly; leading to an increase in retrieval performance.We have implemented our approach and evaluated it experimentally; including a test onskewed and real-world data; comparing it to an approach that has previously been shown tobe superior to other methods.,Fuzzy Sets and Systems,2012,4
Timestamp-based protocols for synchronizing access on xml documents,Sven Helmer; Carl-Christian Kanne; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is well accepted in many differentapplication areas. As a consequence; there is an increasing need for storing XMLdocuments persistently. As soon as many users and applications work concurrently on thesame collection of XML documents–ie an XML base–isolating accesses and modifications ofdifferent transactions becomes an important issue. We discuss two different timestamp-based protocols for synchronizing access on XML document collections. These coreprotocols synchronize structure traversals and modifications. Further; we extend theprotocols to handle node contents and IDREF jumps; so that they can be integrated into anative XML base management System (XBMS).,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,4
Engineering a new abstraction layer to optimize the HEP analysis process,Vasco Amaral; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Presently; in the new high-energy physics experiments we are observing a growingcomplexity in the interfaces of the analysis tools. As a consequence; end users have tomaster programming; understand complex frameworks and data storage details beforeachieving the physics goals. This reduces significantly the efficiency of the analysis process.In order to tackle this problem in analysis; we propose to introduce a new abstraction layerbetween the end users and the current interfaces. We go further in our approach byintroducing Pheasant QL; the first proposal for a declarative domain-specific visual querylanguage into this domain.

Early grouping gets the skew,Sven Helmer; Thomas Neumann; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for external grouping with large results. Our approachhandles skewed data gracefully and lowers the amount of random IO on disk considerably.Contrary to existing grouping algorithms; our new algorithm does not require the optimizer toemploy complicated or error-prone procedures adjusting the parameters prior to query planexecution. We implemented several variants of our algorithm as well as the most commonlyused algorithms for grouping and carried out extensive experiments on both synthetic andreal data. The results of these experiments reveal the dominance of our approach. In case ofheavily skewed data we outperform the other algorithms by a factor of two.,Technical reports,2002,4

Indexing a fuzzy database using the technique of superimposed coding-cost models and measurements,Birgit Boss; Sven Helmer,Abstract: Recently; new applications have emerged that require database managementsystems with uncertainty capabilities. Many of the existing approaches to modellinguncertainty in database management systems are based on the theory of fuzzy sets. Highperformance is a necessary precondition for the acceptance of such systems by end users.However; performance issues have been quite neglected in research on fuzzy databasemanagement systems so far. In this article they are addressed explicitly. We propose newindex structures for fuzzy database management systems based on the well knowntechnique of superimposed coding together with detailed cost models. The correctness ofthe cost models as well as the efficiency of the index structures proposed is validated by anumber of measurements on experimental fuzzy databases.,Technical reports,1996,4

Exploring weaving structures in the Andes: Reflections on the creation of a digital archive,Luciana Martins; Sven Helmer; Denise Y Arnold,In this article; we describe the challenges encountered in creating a digital archive forAndean textiles. Developed at Birkbeck; University of London; within a three-year Arts andHumanities Research Council (AHRC)-funded project (2009–2012) titled “WeavingCommunities of Practice. Textiles; Culture and Identity in the Andes: A Semiotic andOntological Approach;” this archive goes beyond providing a mere repository for digitaldocuments. Our focus has been to improve accessibility by enriching the data related totextiles' production (consisting of texts; images; and videos) with information describing thesocial; historical; and cultural contexts. This allows researchers in the area of textile studiesto gain new insights that go beyond the immediate functional utility of cloth.

Kappa-join: Efficient execution of existential quantification in XML query languages,Matthias Brantner; Sven Helmer; Carl-Christian Kanne; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract XML query languages feature powerful primitives for formulating queries; involvingcomparison expressions which are existentially quantified. If such comparisons involveseveral scopes; they are correlated and; thus; become difficult to evaluate efficiently. In thispaper; we develop a new ternary operator; called Kappa-Join; for efficiently evaluatingqueries with existential quantification. In XML queries; a correlation predicate can occurconjunctively and disjunctively. Our decorrelation approach not only improves performancein the conjunctive case; but also allows decorrelation of the disjunctive case. The latter is notpossible with any known technique. In an experimental evaluation; we compare the queryexecution times of the Kappa-Join with existing XPath evaluation techniques to demonstratethe effectiveness of our new operator.,International XML Database Symposium,2006,3

An Event Detection Framework Supported by a Smart Graphical User Interface,Fabio Persia; Sven Helmer,We develop a graphical user interface for defining events in a framework for detecting high-level surveillance events from a video stream; as the language used for the events may betoo complex for an ordinary user. The language is based on relational algebra extended byintervals; introducing operators whose temporal constraints are described using the well-known Allen's interval relationships. The user interface captures intervals in a descriptiveway; supporting the user in providing the missing parameters in a step-by-step manner. Inthe background; the system checks the user input for consistency and automaticallytransforms it into relational algebra expressions.,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on,2016,2

Using time-sensitive rooted pagerank to detect hierarchical social relationships,Mohammad Jaber; Panagiotis Papapetrou; Sven Helmer; Peter T Wood,Abstract We study the problem of detecting hierarchical ties in a social network by exploitingthe interaction patterns between the actors (members) involved in the network. Motivated byearlier work using a rank-based approach; ie; Rooted-PageRank; we introduce a novel time-sensitive method; called T-RPR; that captures and exploits the dynamics and evolution ofthe interaction patterns in the network in order to identify the underlying hierarchical ties.Experiments on two real datasets demonstrate the performance of T-RPR in terms of recalland show its superiority over a recent competitor method.,International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis,2014,2
On the optimal ordering of maps; selections; and joins under factorization,Thomas Neumann; Sven Helmer; Guido Moerkotte,Abstract We examine the problem of producing the optimal evaluation order for queriescontaining joins; selections; and maps. Specifically; we look at the case where commonsubexpressions involving expensive UDF calls can be factored out. First; we show thatignoring factorization during optimization can lead to plans that are far off the best possibleplan: the difference in cost between the best plan considering factorization and the best plannot considering factorization can easily reach several orders of magnitude. Then; weintroduce optimization strategies that produce optimal left-deep and bushy plans whenfactorization is taken into account. Experiments (1) confirm that factorization is a critical issuewhen it comes to generating optimal plans and (2) we show that to consider factorizationdoes not make plan generation significantly more expensive.,British National Conference on Databases,2006,2
Index structures for fuzzy object-oriented database systems,Sven Helmer,Abstract This chapter gives an overview of indexing techniques suitable for fuzzy object-oriented databases (FOODBSs). First; typical query patterns used in FOODBSs areidentified; namely; single-valued; set-valued; navigational; and type hierarchy access. Thedescription of the patterns does not follow a particular fuzzy object-oriented data model butis kept general enough to be used in different FOODBS contexts. Second; for each querypattern; index structures are presented that support the efficient evaluation of these queries.These range from standard index structures (like B-trees) to sophisticated access methods(like Join Index Hierarchies). Due to space constraints; an explanation of the basictechniques is given rather than an exhaustive description. However; the interested reader issupplied with a broad list of references for further reading.

Sweeping-Based Temporal Aggregation,Danila Piatov; Sven Helmer,Abstract The Timeline Index; which supports temporal joins; time travel; and temporalaggregation on constant intervals; has the potential of becoming a universal index fortemporal database systems. Here we present a family of plane-sweeping algorithms thatextend the set of operators supported by Timeline-Index-based databases to temporalaggregation on fixed intervals; such as a sliding windows or GROUP BY ROLLUPaggregation; and improve the existing algorithm for computing MIN/MAX temporalaggregates on constant intervals. Our method for selective aggregation relies on a new andvery space-efficient data structure called MAX Skyline. In an empirical evaluation we showthat our approach is superior to existing techniques; in some cases we improve theperformance by orders of magnitude.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,1

Increasing the Performance of Fuzzy Retrieval Using Impact Ordering.,Carlos D Barranco; Sven Helmer,Abstract—We propose an approach for indexing fuzzy data based on inverted files thatspeeds up retrieval considerably by stopping the traversal of postings lists early. This ispossible because the entries in the postings lists are organized in a way that guarantees thatthere are no matching items beyond a certain point in a list. Consequently; we can reducethe number of false positives significantly; leading to an increase in retrieval performance.We have implemented our approach and evaluated it experimentally; comparing it to anapproach that has previously been shown to be superior to other methods.,IFSA/EUSFLAT Conf.,2009,1

Itinerary Planning with Category Constraints Using a Probabilistic Approach,Paolo Bolzoni; Fabio Persia; Sven Helmer,Abstract We propose a probabilistic approach for finding approximate solutions to rootedorienteering problems with category constraints. The basic idea is to select nodes from theinput graph according to a probability distribution considering properties such as the rewardof a node; the attractiveness of its neighborhood; its visiting time; and its proximity to thedirect route from source to destination. In this way; we reduce the size of the inputconsiderably; resulting in a much faster execution time. Surprisingly; the quality of thegenerated solutions does not suffer significantly compared to the optimal ones.
