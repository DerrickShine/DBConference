Conditional functional dependencies for data cleaning,Philip Bohannon; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,We propose a class of constraints; referred to as conditional functional dependencies(CFDs); and study their applications in data cleaning. In contrast to traditional functionaldependencies (FDs) that were developed mainly for schema design; CFDs aim at capturingthe consistency of data by incorporating bindings of semantic ally related values. For CFDswe provide an inference system analogous to Armstrong's axioms for FDs; as well asconsistency analysis. Since CFDs allow data bindings; a large number of individualconstraints may hold on a table; complicating detection of constraint violations. We developtechniques for detecting CFD violations in SQL as well as novel techniques for checkingmultiple constraints in a single query. We experimentally evaluate the performance of ourCFD-based methods for inconsistency detection. This not only yields a constraint theory …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Improving data quality: Consistency and accuracy,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Shuai Ma,Abstract Two central criteria for data quality are consistency and accuracy. Inconsistenciesand errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirtydatabase D; one needs automated methods to make it consistent; ie; find a repair D'thatsatisfies the constraints and" minimally" differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that theautomatically-generated repair D'is accurate; or makes sense; ie; D'differs from the" correct"data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving bothdata consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies(CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data; which are able to captureinconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improvethe consistency of the data; we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,305
XPath satisfiability in the presence of DTDs,Michael Benedikt; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract We study the satisfiability problem associated with XPath in the presence of DTDs.This is the problem of determining; given a query p in an XPath fragment and a DTD D;whether or not there exists an XML document T such that T conforms to D and the answer ofp on T is nonempty. We consider a variety of XPath fragments widely used in practice; andinvestigate the impact of different XPath operators on the satisfiability analysis. We first studythe problem for negation-free XPath fragments with and without upward axes; recursion anddata-value joins; identifying which factors lead to tractability and which to NP-completeness.We then turn to fragments with negation but without data values; establishing lower andupper bounds in the absence and in the presence of upward modalities and recursion. Weshow that with negation the complexity ranges from PSPACE to EXPTIME. Moreover …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2008,288
Conditional functional dependencies for capturing data inconsistencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract We propose a class of integrity constraints for relational databases; referred to asconditional functional dependencies (CFDs); and study their applications in data cleaning. Incontrast to traditional functional dependencies (FDs) that were developed mainly for schemadesign; CFDs aim at capturing the consistency of data by enforcing bindings of semanticallyrelated values. For static analysis of CFDs we investigate the consistency problem; which isto determine whether or not there exists a nonempty database satisfying a given set ofCFDs; and the implication problem; which is to decide whether or not a set of CFDs entailsanother CFD. We show that while any set of transitional FDs is trivially consistent; theconsistency problem is NP-complete for CFDs; but it is in PTIME when either the databaseschema is predefined or no attributes involved in the CFDs have a finite domain.

Tiling databases,Floris Geerts; Bart Goethals; Taneli Mielikäinen,Abstract In this paper; we consider 0/1 databases and provide an alternative way ofextracting knowledge from such databases using tiles. A tile is a region in the databaseconsisting solely of ones. The interestingness of a tile is measured by the number of ones itconsists of; ie; its area. We present an efficient method for extracting all tiles with area atleast a given threshold. A collection of tiles constitutes a tiling. We regard tilings that have alarge area and consist of a small number of tiles as appealing summaries of the largedatabase. We analyze the computational complexity of several algorithmic tasks related tofinding such tilings. We develop an approximation algorithm for finding tilings whichapproximates the optimal solution within reasonable factors. We present a preliminaryexperimental evaluation on real data sets.,International Conference on Discovery Science,2004,236
Discovering conditional functional dependencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Ming Xiong,This paper investigates the discovery of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). CFDsare a recent extension of functional dependencies (FDs) by supporting patterns ofsemantically related constants; and can be used as rules for cleaning relational data.However; finding quality CFDs is an expensive process that involves intensive manual effort.To effectively identify data cleaning rules; we develop techniques for discovering CFDs fromrelations. Already hard for traditional FDs; the discovery problem is more difficult for CFDs.Indeed; mining patterns in CFDs introduces new challenges. We provide three methods forCFD discovery. The first; referred to as CFDMiner; is based on techniques for mining closeditem sets; and is used to discover constant CFDs; namely; CFDs with constant patterns only.Constant CFDs are particularly important for object identification; which is essential to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,233
Foundations of data quality management,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management. Adatabase system typically aims to support the creation; maintenance; and use of largeamount of data; focusing on the quantity of data. However; real-life data are often dirty:inconsistent; duplicated; inaccurate; incomplete; or stale. Dirty data in a database routinelygenerate misleading or biased analytical results and decisions; and lead to loss ofrevenues; credibility and customers. With this comes the need for data quality management.In contrast to traditional data management tasks; data quality management enables thedetection and correction of errors in the data; syntactic or semantic; in order to improve thequality of the data and hence; add value to business processes. While data quality has beena longstanding problem for decades; the prevalent use of the Web has increased the risks …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2012,150
Mondrian: Annotating and querying databases through colors and blocks,Floris Geerts; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Diego Milano,Annotations play a central role in the curation of scientific databases. Despite theirimportance; data formats and schemas are not designed to manage the increasing variety ofannotations. Moreover; DBMS's often lack support for storing and querying annotations.Furthermore; annotations and data are only loosely coupled. This paper introduces anannotation-oriented data model for the manipulation and querying of both data andannotations. In particular; the model allows for the specification of annotations on sets ofvalues and for effectively querying the information on their association. We use the conceptof block to represent an annotated set of values. Different colors applied to the blocksrepresent different annotations. We introduce a color query language for our model andprove it to be both complete (it can express all possible queries over the class of …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Relational link-based ranking,Floris Geerts; Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,More specifically; we associate with each rela- tional database and set of queries a unique weighteddirected graph; which we call the database graph. We explore the properties of databasegraphs. In analogy to link analysis algorithms; which use the Web graph to rank web pages; weuse the database graph to rank partial tuples. In this way we can; eg; ex- tend the PageRanklink analysis algorithm to relational databases and give this extension a random querierinterpretation … Similarly; we extend the HITS link analysis al- gorithm to relationaldatabases.

Rewriting regular XPath queries on XML views,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,We study the problem of answering queries posed on virtual views of XML documents; aproblem commonly encountered when enforcing XML access control and integrating data.We approach the problem by rewriting queries on views into equivalent queries on theunderlying document; and thus avoid the overhead of view materialization andmaintenance. We consider possibly recursively defined XML views and study the rewriting ofboth XPath and regular XPath queries. We show that while rewriting is not always possiblefor XPath over recursive views; it is for regular XPath; however; the rewritten query may be ofexponential size. To avoid this prohibitive cost we propose a rewriting algorithm thatcharacterizes rewritten queries as a new form of automata; and an efficient algorithm toevaluate the automaton-represented queries. These allow us to answer queries on views …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,88
The LLUNATIC data-cleaning framework,Floris Geerts; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Donatello Santoro,Abstract Data-cleaning (or data-repairing) is considered a crucial problem in many database-related tasks. It consists in making a database consistent with respect to a set of givenconstraints. In recent years; repairing methods have been proposed for several classes ofconstraints. However; these methods rely on ad hoc decisions and tend to hard-code thestrategy to repair conflicting values. As a consequence; there is currently no generalalgorithm to solve database repairing problems that involve different kinds of constraints anddifferent strategies to select preferred values. In this paper we develop a uniform frameworkto solve this problem. We propose a new semantics for repairs; and a chase-basedalgorithm to compute minimal solutions. We implemented the framework in a DBMS-basedprototype; and we report experimental results that confirm its good scalability and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,84
HaploRec: efficient and accurate large-scale reconstruction of haplotypes,Lauri Eronen; Floris Geerts; Hannu Toivonen,Haplotypes extracted from human DNA can be used for gene mapping and other analysis ofgenetic patterns within and across populations. A fundamental problem is; however; thatcurrent practical laboratory methods do not give haplotype information. Estimation of phasedhaplotypes of unrelated individuals given their unphased genotypes is known as thehaplotype reconstruction or phasing problem. We define three novel statistical models andgive an efficient algorithm for haplotype reconstruction; jointly called HaploRec. HaploRec isbased on exploiting local regularities conserved in haplotypes: it reconstructs haplotypes sothat they have maximal local coherence. This approach–not assuming statisticaldependence for remotely located markers–has two useful properties: it is well-suited forsparse marker maps; such as those used in gene mapping; and it can actually take …,BMC bioinformatics,2006,74
Determining the currency of data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jef Wijsen,Abstract Data in real-life databases become obsolete rapidly. One often finds that multiplevalues of the same entity reside in a database. While all of these values were once correct;most of them may have become stale and inaccurate. Worse still; the values often do notcarry reliable timestamps. With this comes the need for studying data currency; to identify thecurrent value of an entity in a database and to answer queries with the current values; in theabsence of reliable timestamps. This article investigates the currency of data.(1) We proposea model that specifies partial currency orders in terms of simple constraints. The model alsoallows us to express what values are copied from other data sources; bearing currencyorders in those sources; in terms of copy functions defined on correlated attributes.(2) Westudy fundamental problems for data currency; to determine whether a specification is …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,69
On database query languages for K-relations,Floris Geerts; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The relational model has recently been extended to so-called K-relations in whichtuples are assigned a unique value in a semiring K. A query language; denoted by RA K+;similar to the classical positive relational algebra; allows for the querying of K-relations. Inthis paper; we define more expressive query languages for K-relations that extend RA K+with the difference and constant annotations operations on annotated tuples. The latter arenatural extensions of the duplicate elimination operator of the relational algebra on bags.We investigate conditions on semirings under which these operations can be added to RAK+ in a natural way; and establish basic properties of the resulting query languages.Moreover; we show how the provenance semiring of Green et al. can be extended to recordprovenance of data in the presence of difference and constant annotations. Finally; we …,Journal of Applied Logic,2010,67
A tight upper bound on the number of candidate patterns,Floris Geerts; Bart Goethals; Jan Van den Bussche,In the context of mining for frequent patterns using the standard level-wise algorithm; thefollowing question arises: given the current level and the current set of frequent patterns;what is the maximal number of candidate patterns that can be generated on the next level?We answer this question by providing a tight upper bound; derived from a combinatorialresult by J. Kruskal (1963) and G. Katona (1968). Our result is useful for reducing thenumber of database scans.,Data Mining; 2001. ICDM 2001; Proceedings IEEE International Conference on,2001,64
Increasing the expressivity of conditional functional dependencies without extra complexity,Loreto Bravo; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma,The paper proposes an extension of CFDs [1]; referred to as extended ConditionalFunctional Dependencies (eCFDs). In contrast to CFDs; eCFDs specify patterns ofsemantically related values in terms of disjunction and inequality; and are capable ofcatching inconsistencies that arise in practice but cannot be detected by CFDs. The increasein expressive power does not incur extra complexity: we show that the satisfiability andimplication analyses of eCFDs remain NP-complete and coNP-complete; respectively; thesame as their CFDs counterparts. In light of the intractability; we present an algorithm thatapproximates the maximum number of eCFDs that are satisfiable. In addition; we revise SQLtechniques for detecting CFD violations; and show that violations of multiple eCFDs can becaptured via a single pair of SQL queries. We also introduce an incremental SQL …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,63
A Markov chain approach to reconstruction of long haplotypes,Lauri Eronen; Floris Geerts; Hannu Toivonen,Abstract Haplotypes are important for association based gene mapping; but there are nopractical laboratory methods for obtaining them directly from DNA samples. We proposesimple Markov models for reconstruction of haplotypes for a given sample of multilocusgenotypes. The models are aimed specifically for long marker maps; where linkagedisequilibrium between markers may vary and be relatively weak. Such maps are ultimatelyused in chromosome or genome-wide association studies. Haplotype reconstruction withstandard Markov chains is based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboringmarkers. Markov chains of higher order can capture LD in a neighborhood of a given size.We introduce a more flexible and robust model; MC-VL; which is based on a Markov chain ofvariable order.

Satisfiability of XPath queries with sibling axes,Floris Geerts; Wenfei Fan,Abstract We study the satisfiability problem for XPath fragments supporting the following-sibling and preceding-sibling axes. Although this problem was recently studied for XPathfragments without sibling axes; little is known about the impact of the sibling axes on thesatisfiability analysis. To this end we revisit the satisfiability problem for a variety of XPathfragments with sibling axes; in the presence of DTDs; in the absence of DTDs; and undervarious restricted DTDs. In these settings we establish complexity bounds ranging fromNLOGSPACE to undecidable. Our main conclusion is that in many cases; the presence ofsibling axes complicates the satisfiability analysis. Indeed; we show that there are XPathsatisfiability problems that are in PTIME and PSPACE in the absence of sibling axes; but thatbecome NP-hard and EXPTIME-hard; respectively; when sibling axes are used instead of …,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2005,53
Detecting inconsistencies in distributed data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma; Heiko Müller,One of the central problems for data quality is inconsistency detection. Given a database Dand a set¿ of dependencies as data quality rules; we want to identify tuples in D that violatesome rules in¿. When D is a centralized database; there have been effective SQL-basedtechniques for finding violations. It is; however; far more challenging when data in D isdistributed; in which inconsistency detection often necessarily requires shipping data fromone site to another. This paper develops techniques for detecting violations of conditionalfunctional dependencies (CFDs) in relations that are fragmented and distributed acrossdifferent sites.(1) We formulate the detection problem in various distributed settings asoptimization problems; measured by either network traffic or response time.(2) We show thatit is beyond reach in practice to find optimal detection methods: the detection problem is …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,45
A revival of integrity constraints for data cleaning,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia,Abstract Integrity constraints; aka. data dependencies; are being widely used for improvingthe quality of schema.

Annotation propagation revisited for key preserving views,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract This paper revisits the analysis of annotation propagation from source databases toviews defined in terms of conjunctive (SPJ) queries. Given a source database D; an SPJquery Q; the view Q (D) and a tuple ΔV in the view; the view (resp. source) side-effectproblem is to find a minimal set ΔD of tuples such that the deletion of ΔD from D results in thedeletion of ΔV from Q (D) while minimizing the side effects on the view (resp. the source). Athird problem; referred to as the annotation placement problem; is to find a single base tupleΔD such that annotation in a field of ΔD propagates to ΔV while minimizing the propagationto other fields in the view Q (D). These are important for data provenance and themanagement of view updates. However important; these problems are unfortunately NP-hard for most subclasses of SPJ views [5].

Relative information completeness,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract This article investigates the question of whether a partially closed database hascomplete information to answer a query. In practice an enterprise often maintains masterdata D m; a closed-world database. We say that a database D is partially closed if it satisfiesa set V of containment constraints of the form q (D) &subse; p (D m); where q is a query in alanguage LC and p is a projection query. The part of D not constrained by (D m; V) is open;from which some tuples may be missing. The database D is said to be complete for a queryQ relative to (D m; V) if for all partially closed extensions D'of D; Q (D') &equals; Q (D); ie;adding tuples to D either violates some constraints in V or does not change the answer to Q.We first show that the proposed model can also capture the consistency of data; in additionto its relative completeness. Indeed; integrity constraints studied for data consistency can …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,42
Algebraic structures for capturing the provenance of SPARQL queries,Floris Geerts; Thomas Unger; Grigoris Karvounarakis; Irini Fundulaki; Vassilis Christophides,Abstract The evaluation of SPARQL algebra queries on various kinds of annotated RDFgraphs can be seen as a particular case of the evaluation of these queries on RDF graphsannotated with elements of so-called spm-semirings. Spm-semirings extend semirings; usedfor representing the provenance of positive relational algebra queries on annotatedrelational data; with a new operator to capture the semantics of the non-monotone SPARQLoperators. Furthermore; spm-semiring-based annotations ensure that desired SPARQLquery equivalences hold when querying annotated RDF. In this work; in addition tointroducing spm-semirings; we study their properties and provide an alternativecharacterization of these structures in terms of semirings with an embedded booleanalgebra (or seba-structure for short). This characterization allows us to construct spm …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2016,40

Based on the recently proposed conditional functional dependencies (CFDs); it detectsand repairs errors and inconsistencies that emerge as violations of these constraints. Wedemonstrate the following functionalities supported by Semandaq:(a) an interface forspecifying CFDs;(b) a visual tool for automated detection of CFD violations in relational data;leveraging efficient SQL-based techniques;(c) extensive visual data exploration capabilitiesthat provide the user with various measures of the quality of the data;(d) repair (cleaning)functionality without excess human interaction; built upon CFD-based cleaning algorithms;we show how Semandaq allows for a natural exploration of the quality of the obtainedrepairs.

Capturing missing tuples and missing values,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Databases in real life are often neither entirely closed-world nor entirely open-world. Indeed; databases in an enterprise are typically partially closed; in which a part of thedata is constrained by master data that contains complete information about the enterprise incertain aspects [21]. It has been shown that despite missing tuples; such a database mayturn out to have complete information for answering a query [9]. This paper studies partiallyclosed databases from which both tuples and values may be missing. We specify such adatabase in terms of conditional tables constrained by master data; referred to as c-instances. We first propose three models to characterize whether a c-instance T is completefor a query Q relative to master data. That is; depending on how missing values in T areinstantiated; the answer to Q in T remains unchanged when new tuples are added.

Mapping and cleaning,Floris Geerts; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Donatello Santoro,We address the challenging and open problem of bringing together two crucial activities indata integration and data quality; ie; transforming data using schema mappings; and fixingconflicts and inconsistencies using data repairing. This problem is made complex by severalfactors. First; schema mappings and data repairing have traditionally been considered asseparate activities; and research has progressed in a largely independent way in the twofields. Second; the elegant formalizations and the algorithms that have been proposed forboth tasks have had mixed fortune in scaling to large databases. In the paper; we introducea very general notion of a mapping and cleaning scenario that incorporates a wide variety offeatures; like; for example; user interventions.

Inferring data currency and consistency for conflict resolution,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,This paper introduces a new approach for conflict resolution: given a set of tuples pertainingto the same entity; it is to identify a single tuple in which each attribute has the latest andconsistent value in the set. This problem is important in data integration; data cleaning andquery answering. It is; however; challenging since in practice; reliable timestamps are oftenabsent; among other things. We propose a model for conflict resolution; by specifying datacurrency in terms of partial currency orders and currency constraints; and by enforcing dataconsistency with constant conditional functional dependencies. We show that identifyingdata currency orders helps us repair inconsistent data; and vice versa. We investigate anumber of fundamental problems associated with conflict resolution; and establish theircomplexity. In addition; we introduce a framework and develop algorithms for conflict …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,34
Complexity and composition of synthesized web services,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The paper investigates fundamental decision problems and composition synthesisfor Web services commonly found in practice. We propose a notion of synthesized Webservices (ASTs) to specify the behaviors of the services. Upon receiving a sequence of inputmessages; an AST issues multiple queries to a database and generates actions; in parallel;it produces external messages and database updates by synthesizing the actions parallellygenerated. In contrast to previous models for Web services; ASTs advocate parallelprocessing and (deterministic) synthesis of actions. We classify ASTs based on what queriesan AST can issue; how the synthesis of actions is expressed; and whether unbounded inputsequences are allowed in a single interaction session. We show that the behaviors of Webservices supported by various prior models; data-driven or not; can be specified by …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,34
SMOQE: A system for providing secure access to XML,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract XML views have been widely used to enforce access control; support dataintegration; and speed up query answering. In many applications; eg; XML securityenforcement; it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number ofviews. Therefore; views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how toanswer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the viewto an equivalent one on the underlying document; and evaluate the rewritten query. This isthe approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presentsSMOQE; the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual andpossibly recursively defined XML views. We demonstrate a set of novel techniques for thespecification of views; the rewriting; evaluation and optimization of XML queries …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,33
On scale independence for querying big data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Leonid Libkin,Abstract To make query answering feasible in big datasets; practitioners have been lookinginto the notion of scale independence of queries. Intuitively; such queries require only arelatively small subset of the data; whose size is determined by the query and accessmethods rather than the size of the dataset itself. This paper aims to formalize this notion andstudy its properties. We start by defining what it means to be scale-independent; and providematching upper and lower bounds for checking scale independence; for queries in variouslanguages; and for combined and data complexity. Since the complexity turns out to berather high; and since scale-independent queries cannot be captured syntactically; wedevelop sufficient conditions for scale independence. We formulate them based on accessschemas; which combine indexing and constraints together with bounds on the sizes of …,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,32

On the complexity of view update analysis and its application to annotation propagation,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Jizhou Luo,This paper investigates three problems identified in [1] for annotation propagation; namely;the view side-effect; source side-effect; and annotation placement problems. Givenannotations entered for a tuple or an attribute in a view; these problems ask what tuples orattributes in the source have to be annotated to produce the view annotations. As observedin [1]; these problems are fundamental not only for data provenance but also for themanagement of view updates. For an annotation attached to a single existing tuple in a view;it has been shown that these problems are often intractable even for views defined in termsof simple SPJU queries [1]. We revisit these problems by considering severaldichotomies:(1) views defined in various subclasses of SPJU; versus SPJU views under apractical key preserving condition;(2) annotations attached to existing tuples in a view …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,28
Relational completeness of query languages for annotated databases,Floris Geerts; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract Annotated relational databases can be queried either by simply making theannotations explicitly available along the ordinary data; or by adapting the standard queryoperators so that they have an implicit effect also on the annotations. We compare theexpressive power of these two approaches. As a formal model for the implicit approach wepropose the color algebra; an adaptation of the relational algebra to deal with theannotations. We show that the color algebra is relationally complete: it is equivalent to therelational algebra on the explicit annotations. Our result extends a similar completenessresult established for the query algebra of the MONDRIAN annotation system; from unions ofconjunctive queries to the full relational algebra. We also show that the color algebra isnonredundant: no operator can be expressed in terms of the other operators. We also …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,27

This paper presents a promising approach to improving data quality. It effectivelydetects and fixes inconsistencies in real-life data based on conditional dependencies; anextension of database dependencies by enforcing bindings of semantically related datavalues. It accurately identifies records from unreliable data sources by leveraging relativecandidate keys; an extension of keys for relations by supporting similarity and matchingoperators across relations. In contrast to traditional dependencies that were developed forimproving the quality of schema; the revised constraints are proposed to improve the qualityof data. These constraints yield practical techniques for data repairing and record matchingin a uniform framework.,British National Conference on Databases,2009,24
Querying big data by accessing small data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Yang Cao; Ting Deng; Ping Lu,Abstract This paper investigates the feasibility of querying big data by accessing a boundedamount of the data. We study boundedly evaluable queries under a form of accessconstraints; when their evaluation cost is determined by the queries and constraints only.While it is undecidable to determine whether FO queries are boundedly evaluable; we showthat for several classes of FO queries; the bounded evaluability problem is decidable. Wealso provide characterization and effective syntax for their boundedly evaluable queries.When a query Q is not boundedly evaluable; we study two approaches to approximatelyanswering Q under access constraints.(1) We search for upper and lower envelopes of Qthat are boundedly evaluable and warrant a constant accuracy bound.(2) We instantiate aminimum set of variables (parameters) in Q such that the specialized query is boundedly …,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,22

Motivated by applications in geographic information systems; weinvestigate linear approximations of spatial databases and study in which language they canbe expressed effectively. Specifically; we show that they cannot be expressed in thestandard first-order query language for polynomial constraint databases but that anextension of this first-order language with transitive closure suffices to express theapproximation query in an effective manner. Furthermore; we introduce an extension oftransitive-closure logic and show that this logic is complete for the computable queries onlinear spatial databases.

Static analysis of schema-mappings ensuring oblivious termination,Bruno Marnette; Floris Geerts,Abstract A schema-mapping is a high level specification of a data-exchange setting where aset of source-to-target dependencies is used to realize basic operations from source totarget relations (such as copy; selection; join or union) while the target schema is subject toa set of target constraints (such as inclusion dependencies or key constraints). In this paper;we consider strong schema-mappings that allow for additional constraints such as sourcedependencies on the source schema and target-to-source dependencies from the targetrelations back to the source. Furthermore; strong schema-mappings may include disjunctivedependencies. We argue that this extension is desirable when the source instance is toprovide both a lower and upper bound on the information that a target instance can have.We first focus on the implication problem for strong schema-mappings which is to …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Database Theory,2010,20
i MONDRIAN: a visual tool to annotate and query scientific databases,Floris Geerts; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Diego Milano,Abstract We demonstrate i MONDRIAN; a component of the MONDRIAN annotationmanagement system. Distinguishing features of MONDRIAN are (i) the ability to annotatesets of values (ii) the annotation-aware query algebra. On top of that; i MONDRIAN offers ani ntuitive visual i nterface to annotate and query scientific databases. In this demonstration;we consider Gene Ontology (GO); a publicly available biological database. Using thisdatabase we show (i) the creation of annotations through the visual interface (ii) the ability tovisually build complex; annotation-aware; queries (iii) the basic functionality for trackingannotation provenance. Our demonstration also provides a cheat window which shows thesystem internals and how visual queries are translated to annotation-aware algebra queries.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,20
View determinacy for preserving selected information in data transformations,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Lixiao Zheng,Abstract When transforming data one often wants certain information in the data source to bepreserved; ie; we identify parts of the source data and require these parts to be transformedwithout loss of information. We characterize the preservation of selected information in termsof the notions of invertibility and query preservation; in a setting when transformations arespecified as a view V (a set of queries); and source information is selected by a query Q. Weinvestigate the problem for determining whether transformations V preserve the informationselected by Q.(1) We show that the notion of invertibility coincides with view determinacystudied for query rewriting.(2) We establish the undecidability of the problem when either Qor V is in DATALOG or first-order logic; for invertibility and query preservation.(3) When Qand V are conjunctive queries (CQ); the problem is as hard as view determinacy for CQ …,Information Systems,2012,18
A theory of spatio-temporal database queries,Floris Geerts; Sofie Haesevoets; Bart Kuijpers,Abstract We address a fundamental question concerning spatio-temporal databasesystems:“What are exactly spatio-temporal queries?” We define spatio-temporal queries tobe computable mappings that are also generic; meaning that the result of a query may onlydepend to a limited extent on the actual internal representation of the spatio-temporal data.Genericity is defined as invariance under transformations that preserve certaincharacteristics of spatio-temporal data (eg; collinearity; distance; velocity; acceleration;...)that are relevant to a database user. These transformations also respect the monotonenature of time. We investigate different genericity classes relative to the constraint databasemodel for spatio-temporal databases and we identify sound and complete languages for thefirst-order; respectively the computable; queries in these genericity classes.,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2001,17
Conflict resolution with data currency and consistency,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract This article introduces a new approach for conflict resolution: given a set of tuplespertaining to the same entity; it identifies a single tuple in which each attribute has the latestand consistent value in the set. This problem is important in data integration; data cleaning;and query answering. It is; however; challenging since in practice; reliable time stamps areoften absent; among other things. We propose a model for conflict resolution by specifyingdata currency in terms of partial currency orders and currency constraints and by enforcingdata consistency with constant conditional functional dependencies. We show thatidentifying data currency orders helps us repair inconsistent data; and vice versa. Weinvestigate a number of fundamental problems associated with conflict resolution andestablish their complexity. In addition; we introduce a framework and develop algorithms …,Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ),2014,16
That's all folks!: llunatic goes open source,Floris Geerts; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Donatello Santoro,Abstract It is widely recognized that whenever different data sources need to be integratedinto a single target database errors and inconsistencies may arise; so that there is a strongneed to apply data-cleaning techniques to repair the data. Despite this need; databaseresearch has so far investigated mappings and data repairing essentially in isolation.Unfortunately; schema-mappings and data quality rules interact with each other; so thatapplying existing algorithms in a pipelined way--ie; first exchange then data; then repair theresult--does not lead to solutions even in simple settings. We present the Llunatic mappingand cleaning system; the first comprehensive proposal to handle schema mappings anddata repairing in a uniform way. Llunatic is based on the intuition that transforming andcleaning data are different facets of the same problem; unified by their declarative nature …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,16
A view based security framework for XML,Wenfei Fan; Irini Fundulaki; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract As science communities and commercial organisations increasingly exploit XML asa means of exchanging and disseminating information; the selective exposure of informationin XML has become an important issue. In this paper; we present a novel XML securityframework developed to enforce a generic; flexible access-control mechanism for XML datamanagement; which supports efficient and secure query access; without revealing sensitiveinformation to unauthorized users. Major components underlying the framework arediscussed and the current status of a reference implemenation is reported. 1,*,2006,13
Expressing topological connectivity of spatial databases,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers,Abstract We consider two-dimensional spatial databases defined in terms of polynomialinequalities and focus on the potential of program-ming languages for such databases toexpress queries related to topo-logical connectivity. It is known that the topologicalconnectivity test is not first-order expressible. One approach to obtain a language in whichconnectivity queries can be expressed would be to extend FO+ Poly with a generalized (orLindström) quantifier expressing that two points belong to the same connected component ofa given database. For the expression of topological connectivity; extensions of first-orderlanguages with recursion have been studied (in analogy with the classical relational model).Two such languages are spatial Datalog and FO+ Poly+ While. Although both languagesallow the expression of non-terminating pro-grams; their (proven for FO+ Poly+ While and …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,1999,12
Moving objects and their equations of motion,Floris Geerts,Abstract Moving objects are currently represented in databases by means of an explicitrepresentation of their trajectory. However from a physical point of view; or more specificallyaccording to Newton's second law of motion; a moving object is fully described by itsequation of motion. We introduce a new data model for moving objects in which a trajectoryis represented by a differential equation. A similar approach is taken in computer animationwhere this is known as physically based modeling. We give a query language for our datamodel and use techniques from physically based modeling to evaluate queries in thislanguage.,International Symposium on Constraint Databases and Applications,2004,11
The correlation structure of the output of an ATM multiplexer,Chris Blondia; Floris Geerts,Abstract In this paper we study the correlation structure of the output process of an ATMmultiplexer. We consider two special cases:(i) the output process of the D-BMAP/D/1/Nqueue; a generic model for an ATM multiplexer and (ii) a process which results from arenewal process which shares the output link of a multiplexer with other connections. Bothoutput processes belong to the versatile class of discrete-time Markovian arrival processes(D-MAP's). We derive an expression for the Index of Dispersion for Counts (IDC) and for theIndex of Dispersion for Intervals (IDI) of a D-MAP. Two classes of DMAP's are considereddepending on the eigenvalues of the transition matrix: those with an aperiodic transitionmatrix and those with a periodic transition matrix. For both cases we derive a closed formformula for the limit of the IDC (which coincides with the limit of the IDI) and for the …,*,2000,11
Expressiveness and complexity of XML publishing transducers,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Frank Neven,Abstract A number of languages have been developed for specifying XML publishing; that is;transformations of relational data into XML trees. These languages generally describe thebehaviors of a middleware controller that builds an output tree iteratively; issuing queries toa relational source and expanding the tree with the query results at each step. To study thecomplexity and expressive power of XML publishing languages; this article proposes anotion of publishing transducers; which generate XML trees from relational data. We study avariety of publishing transducers based on what relational queries a transducer can issue;what temporary stores a transducer can use during tree generation; and whether or notsome tree nodes are allowed to be virtual; that is; excluded from the output tree. We firstshow how existing XML publishing languages can be characterized by such transducers …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,10
Group Recommendation with Temporal Affinities.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Behrooz Omidvar Tehrani; Senjuti Basu Roy; Nafiseh Shabib; G Alonso; F Geerts; L Popa; P Barceló; J Teubner,ABSTRACT We examine the problem of recommending items to ad-hoc user groups. Grouprecommendation in collaborative rating datasets has received increased attention recentlyand has raised novel challenges. Different consensus functions that aggregate the ratings ofgroup members with varying semantics ranging from least misery to pairwise disagreement;have been studied. In this paper; we explore a new dimension when computing grouprecommendations; that is; affinity between group members and its evolution over time. Weextend existing group recommendation semantics to include temporal affinity inrecommendations and design GRECA; an efficient algorithm that produces temporal affinity-aware recommendations for ad-hoc groups. We run extensive experiments that showsubstantial improvements in group recommendation quality when accounting for affinity …,EDBT,2015,9
Data quality problems beyond consistency and deduplication,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract Recent work on data quality has primarily focused on data repairing algorithms forimproving data consistency and record matching methods for data deduplication. This paperaccentuates several other challenging issues that are essential to developing data cleaningsystems; namely; error correction with performance guarantees; unification of data repairingand record matching; relative information completeness; and data currency. We provide anoverview of recent advances in the study of these issues; and advocate the need fordeveloping a logical framework for a uniform treatment of these issues.,*,2013,9
Topological canonization of planar spatial data and its incremental maintenance,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract It is known that to a planar spatial database; represented by a semi-algebraic set inthe plane; one can associate a structure; here called the “topological canonization”; suchthat two databases are topologically equivalent if and only if their topological canonizationsare isomorphic. The advantage of a topological canonization is that it contains precisely theinformation one needs if one is only interested in topological properties of the spatial data. Inthis paper we represent semi-algebraic sets using plane graph structures. Canonizationsare represented by plane graph structures as well (the so-called canonical structures). Wediscuss the basic properties of canonical structures and of canonization. We then present amethod for incremental maintenance of the canonization under elementary updates on theoriginal spatial database. Incremental maintenance takes less time than recomputing the …,*,1999,9

The method comprises the steps of translatingthe view query to a mixed finite state automata representation of a document query on oneor more documents underlying the database view; and evaluating the document query onthe one or more documents to obtain a result to the view query.

Linearization and completeness results for terminating transitive closure queries on spatial databases,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers; Jan Van den Bussche,We study queries to spatial databases; where spatial data are modeled as semi-algebraicsets; using the relational calculus with polynomial inequalities as a basic query language.We work with the extension of the relational calculus with terminating transitive closures. Themain result is that this language can express the linearization of semialgebraic databases.We also show that the sublanguage with linear inequalities only can express all computablequeries on semilinear databases. As a consequence of these results; we obtain acompleteness result for topological queries on semialgebraic databases.,SIAM Journal on Computing,2006,8
Superposition of Markov sources and long range dependence,Floris Geerts; Chris Blondia,Abstract This paper introduces a model to study the phenomenon of long rangedependence. This model consists of an infinite superposition of independent MarkovianON/OFFsources. A condition for assuring long range dependence is given and the Hurstparameter together with the correlation decay is derived for a specific example. We also givea physical interpretation of the existing long range dependence by means of the Ising model.,*,1998,8
Generating; sampling and counting subclasses of regular tree languages,Timos Antonopoulos; Floris Geerts; Wim Martens; Frank Neven,Abstract To experimentally validate learning and approximation algorithms for XML SchemaDefinitions (XSDs); we need algorithms to generate uniformly at random a corpus of XSDsas well as a similarity measure to compare how close the generated XSD resembles thetarget schema. In this paper; we provide the formal foundation for such a testbed. We adoptsimilarity measures based on counting the number of common and different trees in the twolanguages; and we develop the necessary machinery for computing them. We use theformalism of extended DTDs (EDTDs) to represent the unranked regular tree languages. Inparticular; we obtain an efficient algorithm to count the number of trees up to a certain size inan unambiguous EDTD. The latter class of unambiguous EDTDs encompasses the morefamiliar classes of single-type; restrained competition and bottom-up deterministic EDTDs …,Theory of Computing Systems,2013,7
Bounded query rewriting using views,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Ping Lu,Abstract A query Q has a bounded rewriting using a set of views if there exists a queryQ'expressed in the same language as Q; such that given a dataset D; Q (D) can becomputed by Q'that accesses only cached views and a small fraction DQ of D. We considerdatasets D that satisfy a set of access constraints; a combination of cardinality constraintsand associated indices; such that the size| DQ| of DQ and the time to identify DQ areindependent of| D|; no matter how big D is. This paper studies the problem for decidingwhether a query has a bounded rewriting given a set V of views and a set A of accessconstraints. We establish the complexity of the problem for various query languages; from Σ3 p-complete for conjunctive queries (CQ); to undecidable for relational algebra (FO).

Uniform Dependency Language for Improving Data Quality.,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract A variety of dependency formalisms have been studied for improving data quality.To treat these dependencies in a uniform framework; we propose a simple language; QualityImproving Dependencies (QIDs). We show that previous dependencies considered for dataquality can be naturally expressed as QIDs; and that different enforcement mechanisms ofQIDs yield various data repairing strategies.,IEEE Data Eng.

First-order complete and computationally complete query languages for spatio-temporal databases,Floris Geerts; Sofie Haesevoets; Bart Kuijpers,Abstract We address a fundamental question concerning spatio-temporal databasesystems:“What are exactly spatio-temporal queries&quest;” We define spatio-temporalqueries to be computable mappings that are also generic; meaning that the result of a querymay only depend to a limited extent on the actual internal representation of the spatio-temporal data. Genericity is defined as invariance under groups of geometrictransformations that preserve certain characteristics of spatio-temporal data (eg; collinearity;distance; velocity; acceleration;…). These groups depend on the notions that are relevant inparticular spatio-temporal database applications. These transformations also have thedistinctive property that they respect the monotone and unidirectional nature of time.

On the decidability of termination of query evaluation in transitive-closure logics for polynomial constraint databases,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers,Abstract The formalism of constraint databases; in which possibly infinite data sets aredescribed by Boolean combinations of polynomial inequality and equality constraints; has itsmain application area in spatial databases. The standard query language for polynomialconstraint databases is first-order logic over the reals. Because of the limited expressivepower of this logic with respect to queries that are important in spatial data baseapplications; various extensions have been introduced. We study extensions of first-orderlogic with different types of transitive-closure operators and we are in particular interested indeciding the termination of the evaluation of queries expressible in these transitive-closurelogics. It turns out that termination is undecidable in general. However; we show that thetermination of the transitive closure of a continuous function graph in the two-dimensional …,Theoretical Computer Science,2005,6
Deciding termination of query evaluation in transitive-closure logics for constraint databases,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers,Abstract We study extensions of first-order logic over the reals with different types oftransitive-closure operators as query languages for constraint databases that can bedescribed by Boolean combinations of polynomial inequalities over the reals. We are inparticular interested in deciding the termination of the evaluation of queries expressible inthese transitive-closure logics. It turns out that termination is undecidable in general.However; we show that the termination of the transitive closure of a continuous functiongraph in the two-dimensional plane; viewed as a binary relation over the reals; is decidable;and even expressible in first-order logic over the reals. Based on this result; we identify aparticular transitive-closure logic for which termination of query evaluation is decidable andwhich is more expressive than first-order logic over the reals.

On the data complexity of relative information completeness,Yang Cao; Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Databases in an enterprise are often partially closed: parts of their data must becontained in master data; which has complete information about the core business entities ofthe enterprise. With this comes the need for studying relative information completeness: apartially closed database is said to be complete for a query relative to master data if it hascomplete information to answer the query; ie; extending the database by adding more tupleseither does not change its answer to the query or makes it no longer partially closed wrt themaster data. This paper investigates three problems associated with relative informationcompleteness. Given a query Q and a partially closed database D wrt master data D m;(1)the relative completeness problem is to decide whether D is complete for Q relative to Dm;(2) the minimal completeness problem is to determine whether D is a minimal database …,Information Systems,2014,4
Detecting errors in numeric attributes,Grace Fan; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract To detect errors in numeric data; this paper proposes numeric functionaldependencies (NFDs); a class of dependencies that allow us to specify arithmeticrelationships among numeric attributes. We show that NFDs subsume conditional functionaldependencies (CFDs); hence; we can catch data inconsistencies; numeric or not; in auniform logic framework by using NFDs as data quality rules. Better still; NFDs do notincrease the complexity of reasoning about data quality rules. We show that the satisfiabilityand implication problems for NFDs remain NP-complete and coNP-complete; respectively;the same as their counterparts for CFDs. Moreover; NFDs can be implemented in SQL andhence; error detection can be readily supported by DBMS. In addition; we show that NFDsand CFDs can be extended across multiple tables; without increasing the complexity of …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2014,4
Real algebraic geometry and constraint databases,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers,The constraint database model can be seen as a generalization of the classical relationaldatabase model that was introduced by Codd in the 1970s to deal with the management ofalpha-numerical data; typically in business applications (Codd; 1970). A relational databasecan be viewed as a finite collection of tables or relations that each contain a finite number oftuples. Fig. 13.1 shows an instance of a relational database that contains the two relationsBeer and Pub. This database contains tourist information about beers and the pubs wherethey are served. It also contains the location of the pubs; given in (x; y)-coordinates on sometourist map. Each relation contains a finite number of tuples. A relational database is usuallymodeled following a database schema. A schema contains information on the relationnames and on the names of the attributes appearing in relation. In this example; the …,*,2007,4
Expressing the box cone radius in the relational calculus with real polynomial constraints,Floris Geerts,Abstract We show that there is a query expressible in first-order logic over the reals thatreturns; on any given semi-algebraic set A; for every point; a radius around which A isconical in every small enough box. We obtain this result by combining results fromdifferential topology and real algebraic geometry; with recent algorithmic results by Rannou.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2003,4
Linear approximation of semi-algebraic spatial databases using transitive closure logic; in arbitrary dimension,Floris Geerts,Abstract We consider n-dimensional semi-algebraic spatial databases. We compute in first-order logic extended with a transitive closure operator; a linear spatial database whichcharacterizes the semi-algebraic spatial database up to a homeomorphism. In this way; wegeneralize our earlier results to semi-algebraic spatial databases in arbitrary dimensions;our earlier results being true for only two dimensions. Consequently; we can prove that first-order logic with a transitive closure operator extended with stop conditions; can express allBoolean topological queries on semi-algebraic spatial databases of arbitrary dimension.,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2001,4
Space-bounded query approximation,Boris Cule; Floris Geerts; Reuben Ndindi,Abstract When dealing with large amounts of data; exact query answering is not alwaysfeasible. We propose a query approximation method that; given an upper bound on theamount of data that can be used (ie; for which query evaluation is still feasible); identifies apart C of the data D that (i) fits in the available space budget; and (ii) provides accuratequery results. That is; for a given query Q; the query result Q (C) is close to the exact answerQ (D). In this paper; we present the theoretical framework underlying our queryapproximation method and provide an experimental validation of the approach.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2015,3

Our algorithms are on-line---they react to updates on the data; keepingthe simplification up-to-date. We provide both analytical and empirical evaluations of theefficiency of our algorithms. We prove an O (log n) upper bound on the amortized timecomplexity of our maintenance algorithms; with n the number of insertions.

Topological formulation of termination properties of iterates of functions,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers,Abstract We consider a number of decision problems; that appear in the dynamical systemsand database literature; concerning the termination of iterates of real functions. Thesedecision problems take a function f: R n→ R n as input and ask; for example; whether thisfunction is mortal; nilpotent; terminating; or reaches a fixed point on a given point in R n. Weassociate topologies to functions f: R n→ R n and study some basic properties of thesetopologies. The contribution of this paper is a translation of the above mentioned decisionproblems into decision problems concerning well-known properties of topologies; eg;connectivity. We also show that connectivity of topologies on R n is undecidable for n> 1.,Information processing letters,2004,3
What you store is what you get,Floris Geerts; Bart Goethals; Taneli Mielikäinen,Recent studies emerged the need for representations of frequent itemsets that allow toestimate supports. Several methods have been proposed that achieve this goal bygenerating only a subset of all frequent itemsets. In this paper; we propose anotherapproach; that given a minimum support threshold; stores only a small portion of the originaldatabase from which the supports of frequent itemsets can be estimated. This representationis especially valuable in case one is interested in frequent itemset of size at least somethreshold value. However; we also present methods for estimating the support of smallerfrequent itemsets.,*,2003,3
Interactive correlation clustering,Floris Geerts; Reuben Ndindi,Correlation clustering is to partition a set of objects into clusters such that the number of falsepositives and negatives is minimised. In this paper; we combine correlation clustering anduser interaction. More specifically; we allow the user to control the quality of the clustering byproviding error bounds on the number of false positives and negatives. If no clusterings existthat satisfy these bounds; a set of edges is returned for user inspection such that the deletionor relabelling of these edges guarantees the existence of a clustering consistent with theerror bounds. However; a user may reject the deletion or relabelling of certain edges andask for an alternative set of edges to be provided. If no such set of edges exists; a minimalchange to the error bounds should be provided; after which the interactive processcontinues.

Mapping and Cleaning: the Llunatic Way,Floris Geerts; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Donatello Santoro,Abstract We address the problem of bringing together two crucial activities in dataintegration and data quality; ie; transforming data using schema mappings; and fixingconflicts and inconsistencies using data repairing. This problem is made complex by severalfactors. First; schema mappings and data repairing have traditionally been considered asseparate activities; and research has progressed in a largely independent way in the twofields. Second; the elegant formalizations and the algorithms that have been proposed forboth tasks have had mixed fortune in scaling to large databases. In the paper; we introducea very general notion of a mapping and cleaning scenario that incorporates a wide variety offeatures; like; for example; user interventions.

Capturing Missing Tuples and Missing Values,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Databases in real life are often neither entirely closed-world nor entirely open-world. Databases in an enterprise are typically partially closed; in which a part of the data isconstrained by master data that contains complete information about the enterprise incertain aspects. It has been shown that; despite missing tuples; such a database may turnout to have complete information for answering a query. This article studies partially closeddatabases from which both tuples and attribute values may be missing. We specify such adatabase in terms of conditional tables constrained by master data; referred to as c-instances. We first propose three models to characterize whether a c-instance T is completefor a query Q relative to master data. That is; depending on how missing values in T areinstantiated; the answer to Q in T remains unchanged when new tuples are added. We …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1

Cell-based causality for data repairs,Maxime Debosschere; Floris Geerts,Abstract In recent work; Salimi and Bertossi provide a tight connection between causalityand tuple-based data repairs. We investigate this connection between causality and twoother kinds of repair models. First; we consider cell-based V-repairs; ie; repairs that areobtained by modifying cells in the data. In contrast; tuple-based repairs only allow for thedeletion of tuples. Second; we introduce a new notion of repairs; called chase repairs; thattake into account the procedural (chase) steps that lead to a repair. We establish aconnection between causes (and the associated notion of responsibility) and V-repairs; andanalyse the complexity of verifying whether a cell is a cause and whether its responsibility isabove a certain threshold. Our understanding of chase repairs is still very preliminary; andwe argue that provenance models that are specifically targeted to data repairs and data …,7th {USENIX} Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP 15),2015,1
On recommendation problems beyond points of interest,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Recommendation systems aim to recommend items or packages of items that arelikely to be of interest to users. Previous work on recommendation systems has mostlyfocused on recommending points of interest (POI); to identify and suggest top-k items orpackages that meet selection criteria and satisfy compatibility constraints on items in apackage; where the (packages of) items are ranked by their usefulness to the users. Asopposed to prior work; this paper investigates two issues beyond POI recommendation thatare also important to recommendation systems. When there exist no sufficiently many POIthat can be recommended; we propose (1) query relaxation recommendation to help usersrevise their selection criteria; or (2) adjustment recommendation to guide recommendationsystems to modify their item collections; such that the users׳ requirements can be satisfied …,Information Systems,2015,1

Geometric and algorithmic aspects of topological queries to spatial databases,Floris Geerts,Excerpt from the introduction: Overview The following chapters are organized as follows.Chapter 2 provides the necessary background on constraint databases and querylanguages. It gives the definition of topological queries and introduces transitive closurelogics. Chapter 3 shows that FO+ LIN+ TCS is computationally complete on Z-linearconstraint databases; and that FO+ Po1v+ TCS is computationally complete on polynomialconstraint databases with respect to Boolean topological queries.

Querying big data by accessing small data,*,A processor executes instructions stored in non-transitory memory to determine whether aquery to big data is bounded evaluable; or may be rewritten to access a bounded amount ofdata or information in a dataset. A query plan may retrieve the information by using indicesin access constraints of the query. The cost associated with obtaining the information byusing the query plan may be dependent on the query and access constraints and not thesize of the dataset. A query plan to obtain the information may be formed for different typesor classes of queries; such as conjunctive queries (CQ); unions of conjunctive queries(UCQ) and positive existential FO (first order) conjunctive queries (∃ FO+). When a query isnot bounded evaluable; a determination is made whether an approximation to theinformation may be retrieved. An approximation may be obtained by using upper and …,*,2017,*
On the expressive power of query languages for matrices,Robert Brijder; Floris Geerts; Jan Van den Bussche; Timmy Weerwag,Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of $\mathsf {MATLANG} $; a formal languagefor matrix manipulation based on common matrix operations and linear algebra. Thelanguage can be extended with the operation $\mathsf {inv} $ of inverting a matrix. In$\mathsf {MATLANG}+\mathsf {inv} $ we can compute the transitive closure of directedgraphs; whereas we show that this is not possible without inversion. Indeed we show thatthe basic language can be simulated in the relational algebra with arithmetic operations;grouping; and summation. We also consider an operation $\mathsf {eigen} $ fordiagonalizing a matrix; which is defined so that different eigenvectors returned for a sameeigenvalue are orthogonal. We show that $\mathsf {inv} $ can be expressed in $\mathsf{MATLANG}+\mathsf {eigen} $. We put forward the open question whether there are …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.08359,2017,*
Cleaning data with forbidden itemsets,Joeri Rammelaere; Floris Geerts; Bart Goethals,Methods for cleaning dirty data typically rely on additional information about the data; suchas user-specified constraints that specify when a database is dirty. These constraints ofteninvolve domain restrictions and illegal value combinations. Traditionally; a database isconsidered clean if all constraints are satisfied. However; many real-world scenario's onlyhave a dirty database available. In such a context; we adopt a dynamic notion of dataquality; in which the data is clean if an error discovery algorithm does not find any errors. Weintroduce forbidden itemsets which capture unlikely value co-occurrences in dirty data; andwe derive properties of the lift measure to provide an efficient algorithm for mining low liftforbidden itemsets. We further introduce a repair method which guarantees that the repaireddatabase does not contain any low lift forbidden itemsets. The algorithm uses nearest …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*
First-order under-approximations of consistent query answers,Floris Geerts; Fabian Pijcke; Jef Wijsen,Abstract Consistent Query Answering (CQA) is a principled approach for answering querieson inconsistent databases. The consistent answer to a query q on an inconsistent databasedb is the intersection of the answers to q on all repairs; where a repair is any consistentdatabase that is maximally close to db. Unfortunately; computing consistent answers underprimary key constraints has already exponential data complexity for very simple conjunctivequeries; and is therefore completely impracticable. In this paper; we propose a newframework for divulging an inconsistent database to end users; which adopts two postulates.The first postulate complies with CQA and states that inconsistencies should never bedivulged to end users. Therefore; end users should only get consistent query answers. Thesecond postulate states that only those queries can be answered whose consistent …,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2017,*
Topological elementary equivalence of regular semi-algebraic sets in three-dimensional space,Floris Geerts; Bart Kuijpers,We consider semi-algebraic sets and properties of these sets that are expressible bysentences in first-order logic over the reals. We are interested in first-order properties thatare invariant under topological transformations of the ambient space. Two semi-algebraicsets are called topologically elementarily equivalent if they cannot be distinguished by suchtopological first-order sentences. So far; only semi-algebraic sets in one and two-dimensional space have been considered in this context. Our contribution is a naturalcharacterisation of topological elementary equivalence of regular closed semi-algebraic setsin three-dimensional space; extending a known characterisation for the two-dimensionalcase. Our characterisation is based on the local topological behaviour of semi-algebraic setsand the key observation that topologically elementarily equivalent sets can be …,*,2016,*
Scale Independence: Using Small Data to Answer Queries on Big Data (Invited Talk),Floris Geerts,Abstract Large datasets introduce challenges to the scalability of query answering. Given aquery Q and a dataset D; it is often prohibitively costly to compute the query answers Q (D)when D is big. To this end; one may want to use heuristics;" quick and dirty" algorithmswhich return approximate answers. However; in many applications it is a must to find exactquery answers. So; how can we efficiently compute Q (D) when D is big or when we onlyhave limited resources? One idea is to find a small subset D_Q of D such that Q (D_Q)= Q(D) where the size of D_Q is independent of the size of the underlying dataset D. Intuitively;when such a D_Q can be found for a query Q; the query is said to be scale independent(Armbrust et al. 2011; Armbrust et al. 2013; Fan et al. 2014). Indeed; for answering suchqueries the size of the underlying database does not matter; ie; query processing is …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2016,*

An Overview of the Llunatic System.,Floris Geerts; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Donatello Santoro,Data transformation and data cleaning are two very important research and applicationproblems. Data transformation; or data exchange [7]; relies on declarative schema mappingsto translate and integrate data coming from one or more source schemas into a differenttarget schema. Data cleaning; or data repairing [8]; uses declarative dataquality rules inorder to detect and remove errors and inconsistencies from the data. It is widely recognisedthat whenever mappings among different sources are in place; there is a strong need toclean and repair data. Despite this need; database research has so far investigated schemamappings and data repairing essentially in isolation. We present the LLUNATIC [11; 12]mapping and cleaning system; the first comprehensive proposal to handle schemamappings and data repairing in a uniform way. LLUNATIC is based on the intuition that …,SEBD,2014,*
Looking at the World Thru Colored Glasses,Floris Geerts; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Heiko Müller,Abstract There are two central issues in the curation of (scientific) databases: annotationmanagement and archiving. Both issues have been addressed by the Edinburgh databasegroup and led to the MONDRIAN annotation management system and the XArch archivingsystem; respectively. In this paper; we present an application of MONDRIAN to representand query the history of evolving databases. We show how the annotation model and querylanguage underlying MONDRIAN not only allows to answer queries about how individualdata values change over time; but also allows to capture and query structural changes thatoccur in a database over time; beyond the querying functionalities that XArch currentlyoffers.,*,2013,*
Constraint Databases,Floris Geerts,Query processing algorithms are designed to efficiently exploit the available cache units inthe memory hierarchy. Cache-conscious algorithms typically employ knowledge ofarchitectural parameters such as cache size and latency. This knowledge can be used toensure that the algorithms have good temporal and/or spatial locality on the target platform.,*,2009,*
