On rigorous transaction scheduling,Yuri Breitbart; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Marek Rusinkiewicz; Abraham Silberschatz,The class of transaction scheduling mechanisms in which the transaction serialization ordercan be determined by controlling their commitment order; is defined. This class oftransaction management mechanisms is important; because it simplifies transactionmanagement in a multidatabase system environment. The notion of analogous executionand serialization orders of transactions is defined and the concept of strongly recoverableand rigorous execution schedules is introduced. It is then proven that rigorous schedulersalways produce analogous execution and serialization orders. It is shown that the systemsusing the rigorous scheduling can be naturally incorporated in hierarchical transactionmanagement mechanisms. It is proven that several previously proposed multidatabasetransaction management mechanisms guarantee global serializability only if all …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1991,222
On serializability of multidatabase transactions through forced local conflicts,Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Marek Rusinkiewicz; Amit Sheth,A multidatabase transaction management mechanism called the optimistic ticket method(OTM) is introduced for enforcing global serializability. It permits the commitment ofmultidatabase transactions only if their relative serialization order is the same in allparticipating local database systems (LDBSs). OTM requires the LDBSs to guarantee onlylocal serializability. The basic idea in OTM is to create direct conflicts between multidatabasetransactions at each LDBS in order to determine the relative serialization order of theirsubtransactions. A refinement of OTM; called the implicit ticket method (ITM); is alsointroduced that uses implicit tickets and eliminates ticket conflicts but works only when theparticipating LDBSs use rigorous transaction scheduling mechanisms. ITM uses the localcommitment order of each subtransaction to determine its implicit ticket value. It achieves …,Data Engineering; 1991. Proceedings. Seventh International Conference on,1991,218
Modeling and composing service-based and reference process-based multi-enterprise processes,Hans Schuster; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Andrzej Cichocki; Donald Baker,Abstract Multi-enterprise processes (MEPs) are workflows consisting of a set of activities thatare implemented by different enterprises. Tightly coupled Virtual Enterprises (VEs) typicallyagree on abstract MEPs (reference MEPs); to which each enterprise contributes single-enterprise processes (SEPs) that implement and refine the activities in the reference MEP.On the other end of the spectrum; loosely coupled VEs use service-based MEPs that fusetogether heterogeneous services implemented and provided by different enterprises.Existing process models usually couple activities with their implementation. Therefore; theycannot effectively support such MEPs. In this paper; we introduce a Polymorphic ProcessModel (PPM) that supports both reference process-and service-based MEPs. To accomplishthis; PPM decouples activity interface from activity implementation; and provides process …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2000,208

Managing process and service fusion in virtual enterprises,Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Hans Schuster; Andrzej Cichocki; Donald Baker,Abstract Virtual Enterprises (VEs) are businesses providing services and products that relyon the resources of multiple enterprises. VEs can achieve their business objectives onlythrough effective collaboration between the autonomous enterprises that comprise them. Inthis paper we advocate the position that effective multi-enterprise collaboration can beachieved by integrating the business processes of the participant enterprises; and bymanaging the resulting multi-enterprise (business) processes. A key requirement for this isdeveloping multi-enterprise processes that explicitly capture and manage the functional andcontractual relationships between the enterprises in a VE. In particular; this includes the inter-enterprise services each enterprise in a VE provides to others as needed to realize multi-enterprise processes.

Using tickets to enforce the serializability of multidatabase transactions,Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Marek Rusinkiewicz; Amit P.  Sheth,To enforce global serializability in a multidatabase environment the multidatabasetransaction manager must take into account the indirect (transitive) conflicts betweenmultidatabase transactions caused by local transactions. Such conflicts are difficult toresolve because the behavior or even the existence of local transactions is not known to themultidatabase system. To overcome these difficulties; we propose to incorporate additionaldata manipulation operations in the subtransactions of each multidatabase transaction. Weshow that if these operations create direct conflicts between subtransactions at eachparticipating local database system; indirect conflicts can be resolved even if themultidatabase system is not aware of their existence. Based on this approach; we introduceoptimistic and conservative multidatabase transaction management methods that require …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1994,126

A security framework in G-Hadoop for big data computing across distributed Cloud data centres,Jiaqi Zhao; Lizhe Wang; Jie Tao; Jinjun Chen; Weiye Sun; Rajiv Ranjan; Joanna Kołodziej; Achim Streit; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,Abstract MapReduce is regarded as an adequate programming model for large-scale data-intensive applications. The Hadoop framework is a well-known MapReduce implementationthat runs the MapReduce tasks on a cluster system. G-Hadoop is an extension of theHadoop MapReduce framework with the functionality of allowing the MapReduce tasks torun on multiple clusters. However; G-Hadoop simply reuses the user authentication and jobsubmission mechanism of Hadoop; which is designed for a single cluster. This workproposes a new security model for G-Hadoop. The security model is based on severalsecurity solutions such as public key cryptography and the SSL protocol; and is dedicatedlydesigned for distributed environments.

Method for enforcing the serialization of global multidatabase transactions through committing only on consistent subtransaction serialization by the local database...,*,Our invention guarantees global serializability by preventing multidatabase transactionsfrom being serialized in different ways at the participating local database systems (LDBS). Inone embodiment tickets are used to inform the MDBS of the relative serialization order of thesubtransactions of each global transactions at each LDBS. A ticket is a (logical) timestampwhose value is stored as a regular data item in each LDBS. Each substransaction of a globaltransaction is required to issue the take-a-ticket operations which consists of reading thevalue of the ticket (ie; read ticket) and incrementing it (ie; write (ticket+ 1)) through regulardata manipulation operations. Only the subtransactions of global transactions take tickets.When different global transactions issue subtransactions at a local database; eachsubtransaction will include the take-a-ticket operations. Therefore; the ticket values …,*,1993,63

A framework for enforceable specification of extended transaction models and transactional workflows,Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Mark F Hornick,A variety of extensions to the traditional (ACID) transaction model have resulted in a plethoraof extended transaction models (ETMs). Many of these ETMs are application-specific; ie theyare designed to provide correctness guarantees adequate for a particular application; butnot others. Similarly; an application-specific ETM may impose restrictions that areunacceptable in one application; yet required in another. To define new ETMs; to determinewhether an ETM is appropriate for an application; and to integrate ETMs to produce newETMs; we need a framework for ETM specification and reasoning. In this paper; we describesuch a framework. Our framework supports implementation-independent specification ofETMs described in terms of dependencies between transactions.

A decentralized deadlock-free concurrency control method for multidatabase transactions,Raj Kumar Batra; Marek Rusinkiewicz; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,A global concurrency control mechanism for multidatabase systems that preserves theautonomy of local databases and is free from global deadlocks is presented. Themechanism extends the notion of timestamps to a multidatabase environment to enforce theglobal serialization order through additional data operations on a data item stored in localsystems. The main advantage of the mechanism is that it allows a fully distributedarchitecture; in which concurrency control decisions can be made on the basis of locallyavailable information. Since no centralized information is maintained by the mechanism; itprovides a higher degree of fault tolerance and allows incremental growth.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1992.; Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on,1992,36

The extant correctness criteria used toschedule the execution of concurrent transactions are either time independent or use strict;difficult to satisfy real-time constraints. On one end of the spectrum; serializability completelyignores time. On the other end; deadline scheduling approaches consider the outcome ofeach transaction execution correct only if the transaction meets its real-time deadline. In thisarticle; we explore new correctness criteria and scheduling methods that capture temporaltransaction dependencies and belong to; the broad area between these two extremeapproaches. We introduce the concepts of succession dependency and chronologicaldependency and define correctness criteria under which temporal dependencies …,The VLDB Journal,1994,31
Dynamic configuration of sensors using mobile sensor hub in internet of things paradigm,Charith Perera; Prem Jayaraman; Arkady Zaslavsky; Peter Christen; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors to be connected to the Internet. Bydeploying intelligent low-level computational devices such as mobile phones in-betweensensors and cloud servers; we can reduce data communication with the use of intelligentprocessing such as fusing and filtering sensor data; which saves significant amount ofenergy. This is also ideal for real world sensor deployments where connecting sensorsdirectly to a computer or to the Internet is not practical. Most of the leading IoT middlewaresolutions require manual and labour intensive tasks to be completed in order to connect amobile phone to them. In this paper we present a mobile application called Mobile SensorHub (MoSHub). It allows variety of different sensors to be connected to a mobile phone andsend the data to the cloud intelligently reducing network communication.

Semantic-driven configuration of internet of things middleware,Charith Perera; Arkady Zaslavsky; Michael Compton; Peter Christen; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,We are currently observing emerging solutions to enable the Internet of Things (IoT).Efficient and feature rich IoT middeware platforms are key enablers for IoT. However; due tocomplexity; most of these middleware platforms are designed to be used by IT experts. Inthis paper; we propose a semantics-driven model that allows non-IT experts (eg plantscientist; city planner) to configure IoT middleware components easier and faster. Such toolsallow them to retrieve the data they want without knowing the underlying technical details ofthe sensors and the data processing components.

Transaction management in multidatabase systems,Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,Abstract The concept of Multidatabase Systems (MDBS) was introduced to supportapplications that access data stored in multiple databases; controlled by autonomous andpossibly heterogeneous Local Database Systems (LDBSs). The autonomy and theheterogeneity of the LDBSs causes several new problems in multidatabase transactionmanagement that do not exist in other distributed database systems. The primary difficulty inenforcing global serializability in a multidatabase environment is due to the fact thattransaction execution and serialization orders can be different. To determine theserialization order of global transactions the MDBS must take into account conflicts causedby local transactions. However; due to the autonomy of the LDBSs such information is notavailable. A serious problem in multidatabase recovery is that MDBS recovery actions …,*,1991,21

Privacy protection for wireless medical sensor data,Xun Yi; Athman Bouguettaya; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Andy Song; Jan Willemson,In recent years; wireless sensor networks have been widely used in healthcare applications;such as hospital and home patient monitoring. Wireless medical sensor networks are morevulnerable to eavesdropping; modification; impersonation and replaying attacks than thewired networks. A lot of work has been done to secure wireless medical sensor networks.The existing solutions can protect the patient data during transmission; but cannot stop theinside attack where the administrator of the patient database reveals the sensitive patientdata. In this paper; we propose a practical approach to prevent the inside attack by usingmultiple data servers to store patient data.

From events to awareness,Donald Baker; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Marian Nodine; Andrzej Cichocki,We define" awareness" as information that is highly relevant to the needs of users and that isdelivered in a timely manner. We advocate an event composition approach for computingawareness from various event sources and we describe the events to awarenessarchitecture (E2A) as an embodiment of that approach. E2A is an event-drivenpublish/subscribe architecture that can be implemented using existing technologies andapplied to various domains to provide awareness to users. We describe two differentsystems where the E2A has been employed to meet the awareness needs of differentdomains; specifically video surveillance for physical security and human coordination,Services Computing Workshops; 2006.

Analytics‐as‐a‐service in a multi‐cloud environment through semantically‐enabled hierarchical data processing,Prem Prakash Jayaraman; Charith Perera; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Schahram Dustdar; Dhavalkumar Thakker; Rajiv Ranjan,Summary A large number of cloud middleware platforms and tools are deployed to support avariety of internet-of-things (IoT) data analytics tasks. It is a common practice that such cloudplatforms are only used by its owners to achieve their primary and predefined objectives;where raw and processed data are only consumed by them. However; allowing third partiesto access processed data to achieve their own objectives significantly increases integrationand cooperation and can also lead to innovative use of the data. Multi-cloud; privacy-awareenvironments facilitate such data access; allowing different parties to share processed datato reduce computation resource consumption collectively.

Business process learning for real time enterprises,Rodion Podorozhny; Anne Ngu; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,Abstract Existing approaches for business process mining cannot satisfy Real-TimeEnterprise (RTE) goals; such as time-based competition. To support RTE requirements wepropose a Process Learning System (PLS) that is capable of learning business processesfrom a few observed traces and do this in a timeframe that is close to the actual time forcompleting the process. Unlike existing approaches PLS employs a rich process model thatfacilitates “guessing” business processes; utilizes domain-specific knowledge captured byactivity and resource ontologies; ensures that learned processes comply with specifiedbusiness rules; and optimizes them to reduce required cost and time. In this paper we focuson the architecture of PLS; and describe the functionality and algorithms employed by keyPLS components.

The Collaboration Management Model (CMM) developed in MCC provides aframework for modeling and implementing MEPs. In this paper we propose to extend theCMM with workflow migration; that is; with the ability of workflows to transfer their code andexecution state to another host during run time. This permits the enterprises in a VE to agreeupon abstract workflows that consist of placeholder activities capturing the need for inter-enterprise services. Abstract workflow execution involves its migration to the enterprise sitesthat provide the services its requires.

Do-it-yourself content delivery network orchestrator,Rajiv Ranjan; Karan Mitra; Suhit Saha; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Content delivery networks (CDNs)[1] provide fast and reliable content access to theend-users. CDN providers (eg; Akamai [2]); either own the entire infrastructure or it isoutsourced to a single Cloud provider. Content owners (eg; clients and end-users) need toestablish expensive contracts with third party ISPs or CDN providers. Hence; existing CDNservices are out of reach for all but large enterprises. Current CDNs do not provide servicesthat allow an end-user to create dynamic content such as combining music videos from anexisting content source on the Internet. Finally; the content owners do not have low-levelcontrol over the orchestration operations such as; multiple Cloud provider selection andresource management for hosting content. Hence; the content owners are dependent ontheir CDN providers to perform these operations behind the scene.,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2012,3

Transaction management in a distributed database system for local area networks,Marek Rusinkiewicz; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,The design and implementation of an experimental fault-tolerant distributed databasemanagement system is described. The system provides a logically integrated view of datawith distribution transparency and a controlled data replication. A commitment protocol usedto guarantee atomicity of update operations is discussed. Efficient algorithms used torecover a site from a failure and restore data consistency are described. Recovery can beinterleaved with the processing of regular database transactions and does not seriously limitthe availability of data. The proposed solutions to the problems of fault recovery aredesigned to take advantage of the properties of a high-bandwidth local area network.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 1988.

REQUEST II—a distributed database system for local area networks,Marek Rusinkiewicz; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,ABSTRACT The design and implementation of a distributed database management system;organized as a collection of a central database and several member databases is described.The central database contains copies of all data items that reside in member databases; and(possibly) some additional data that are not replicated. All updates are applied first to themaster copy of the data item at a member database; and then propagated to the central site.Distributed concurrency control uses the Two-Phase Locking with primary copies. Protectionfrom the loss of data consistency; due to site network failures; is provided by" i spoolingmechanism which is used to keep logs of all incomplete update operations. The controlleddata replication scheme used in the system simplifies the implementation of transactionprocessing; concurrency control and fault recovery facilities.,Proceedings of 1986 ACM Fall joint computer conference,1986,3

Software architecture for flexible integration of process model synthesis methods,Rodion Podorozhny; Anne Hee Hiong Ngu; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Dewayne Perry,In this paper we suggest an architecture that would integrate various methods for synthesisof a software process model based on domain knowledge about artifacts; processfragments; tools; and limited process execution observations. Our approach suggests usinga meta-process specification for integration of various process synthesis methods to providea generalized process model. We also propose using a process execution observation forconfirmation of a synthesized process model.,*,2006,1

RDS: A Primitive for the Maintenance of Replicated Data Objects,Marek Rusinkiewicz; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Roshan Thomas,A reliable data server (RDS) is a distributed system that encapsulates replicated dataobjects (either main memory or secondary storage copies on different sites) and theirmaintenance primitives. RDS is seen by its clients as a single entity regardless of thenumber of sites that constitute it. Since different applications may have different reliabilityrequirements; RDS can provide uninterrupted service while tolerating a user-definednumber of failures. To achieve a desired degree of resiliency free sites may be dynamicallyincorporated into RDS to bold additional copies of data objects. Under this approach; a sitefailure does not cause the abortion of transactions in progress and the availability of thereplicated data is not limited during recovery. The design of the system is presented andsome preliminary results of the evaluation of its performance are discussed.,2nd IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing,1990,1

A note on resource management techniques and systems for big data workflow processing,Rajiv Ranjan; Prem Prakash Jayaraman; Massimo Villari; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos,The continuous shift towards data-driven enterprises and the necessity of getting real-timeinsights from streaming data (eg tweets; web clicks) has expedited the development ofdozens of big data analytics workflows (eg click-stream analytics). Resource management ofsuch analytics workflows is vital; since it enables cost-effective usage of cloud servicesagainst unpredictable time-varying workloads (characterised by 3Vs—volume; velocity andveracity). A typical streaming data analytics workflow consists of three layers: data ingestion;analytics; and storage; each of which is backed by different data processing platforms (egAmazon Kinesis; Apache Storm; DynamoDB; respectively) and is served by different cloudservices (eg VM; Queues). Moreover; the application workloads processed by the dataanalytics workflows are heterogeneous and demand different performance and quality of …,*,2018,*

Context-driven Granular Disclosure Control for Internet of Things Applications,Arezou Soltani Panah; Ali Yavari; Ron van Schyndel; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Xun Yi,The Internet of Things represents a technology revolution transforming the currentenvironment into a ubiquitous world; whereby everything that benefits from being connectedwill be connected. Despite the benefits; the privacy of these things becomes a great concernand it is imperative to apply privacy preservation techniques to IoT data collection. One suchtechnique is called data obfuscation in which data is deliberately modified to blur thesensitive information. The current obfuscation techniques; however; focus on the privacy ofpublished datasets. The high connectivity and distributed nature of IoT; opens up thepossibility of privacy compromise before obfuscation can take effect; and therefore privacyenforcement should be deployed at earlier stages. Classical privacy treatments are toorestrictive for IoT; where coarser/finer data details should be revealed. Motivated by these …,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2017,*

More complex practical problems frequently have some specialstructure that might be exploited. In the field of mixed integer linear programming; three decompositiontechniques are particularly well known for taking advantage of special structures: Lagrangiandecomposition; Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition(column generation); and Benders´decomposition. It has been recognized that these concepts may also provide a very fruitful basisfor effective hybrid metaheuristics.

Collaborative information analysis for sensor-enabled scientific applications,Ali Salehi; Mukaddim Pathan; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; David Deery,Data collected from sensor networks are often analysed by cross-domain scientists whoproduce results that are requested by a variety of clients. In such a collaborativeenvironment; scientific experiments include data collection form sensors; and data analysisperformed by scientists. To meet the client requirements these activities have to bedynamically coordinated. Furthermore; this coordination must occur whenever data analysisresults indicate that sensor data streams need to be adjusted to provide desirable results. Inthis paper; we present a platform and the design of its architecture that enable such real-timecollaborative analysis of sensor data. We also discuss a case study from plant phenomicsresearch. We illustrate that our solution permits scientists to build executable data modelsand conduct immediate data analysis that are driven by direct feedback from clients.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2010 6th International Conference on,2010,*

In this paper we focus on the development of IoT-based smart services for solvingurban problems that involve IoT-enabled Observation; Orientation; Decision; and Action(OODA) loops. We also focus on how to efficiently support such OODA loops in situationswhere such loops involve internet-scale data. More specifically; IoT supports Observation viathe discovery of sensors and the integration of their data. It supports Orientation via acontextualisation process that refines such data to include only those that are relevant to thesituation and/or activities of each specific individual or group. As IoT contextualisationpotentially involves internet-scale data; performing this process efficiently allows for fastdecision making; and this in turn permits carrying out a timely Action.

Dimitrios Georgakopoulos Alex Buchmann,Alex Buchmann,The roots of wavelet theory reach back to the end of the 19th century. The so-called;developed in 1909 by A. Haar; still serves as the foundation of modern wavelet theory. It tooka long time; however; until the wavelet-based hierarchical data decomposition found itswidespread application in computer science. Wavelets are seen as the"(re) discovery of thelast decade" in Computer Graphics and; in the meantime; they are used in a wide variety ofapplications including a number of diverse database applications. Examples are: similaritysearch; data compression; dimensionality reduction; time series analysis; and dataclustering. The wavelet theory is well founded and of very high practical impact. The largenumber of advantages include the strict hierarchical and multiresolutional nature of thewavelet decomposition; the linear time and space complexity of the wavelet …,*,*,*
