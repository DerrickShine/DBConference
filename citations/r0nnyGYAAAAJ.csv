Swarm: Mining relaxed temporal moving object clusters,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Roland Kays,Abstract Recent improvements in positioning technology make massive moving object datawidely available. One important analysis is to find the moving objects that travel together.Existing methods put a strong constraint in defining moving object cluster; that they requirethe moving objects to stick together for consecutive timestamps. Our key observation is thatthe moving objects in a cluster may actually diverge temporarily and congregate at certaintimestamps. Motivated by this; we propose the concept of swarm which captures the movingobjects that move within arbitrary shape of clusters for certain timestamps that are possiblynon-consecutive. The goal of our paper is to find all discriminative swarms; namely closedswarm. While the search space for closed swarms is prohibitively huge; we design amethod; ObjectGrowth; to efficiently retrieve the answer. In ObjectGrowth; two effective …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,237
Generalized fisher score for feature selection,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Fisher score is one of the most widely used supervised feature selection methods.However; it selects each feature independently according to their scores under the Fishercriterion; which leads to a suboptimal subset of features. In this paper; we present ageneralized Fisher score to jointly select features. It aims at finding an subset of features;which maximize the lower bound of traditional Fisher score. The resulting feature selectionproblem is a mixed integer programming; which can be reformulated as a quadraticallyconstrained linear programming (QCLP). It is solved by cutting plane algorithm; in eachiteration of which a multiple kernel learning problem is solved alternatively by multivariateridge regression and projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark data setsindicate that the proposed method outperforms Fisher score as well as many other state …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3725,2012,220
Mining periodic behaviors for moving objects,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Roland Kays; Peter Nye,Abstract Periodicity is a frequently happening phenomenon for moving objects. Findingperiodic behaviors is essential to understanding object movements. However; periodicbehaviors could be complicated; involving multiple interleaving periods; partial time span;and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper; we address the problem of miningperiodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect theperiods in complex movement; and how to mine periodic movement behaviors. Our mainassumption is that the observed movement is generated from multiple interleaved periodicbehaviors associated with certain reference locations. Based on this assumption; wepropose a two-stage algorithm; Periodica; to solve the problem. At the first stage; the notionof observation spot is proposed to capture the reference locations. Through observation …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,198
Joint feature selection and subspace learning,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Dimensionality reduction is a very important topic in machine learning. It can begenerally classified into two categories: feature selection and subspace learning. In the pastdecades; many methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction. However; mostof these works study feature selection and subspace learning independently. In this paper;we present a framework for joint feature selection and subspace learning. We reformulatethe subspace learning problem and use L2; 1-norm on the projection matrix to achieverowsparsity; which leads to selecting relevant features and learning transformationsimultaneously. We discuss two situations of the proposed framework; and present theiroptimization algorithms. Experiments on benchmark face recognition data sets illustrate thatthe proposed framework outperforms the state of the art methods overwhelmingly.,IJCAI Proceedings-International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2011,110
Incremental clustering for trajectories,Zhenhui Li; Jae-Gil Lee; Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Trajectory clustering has played a crucial role in data analysis since it revealsunderlying trends of moving objects. Due to their sequential nature; trajectory data are oftenreceived incrementally; eg; continuous new points reported by GPS system. However; sinceexisting trajectory clustering algorithms are developed for static datasets; they are notsuitable for incremental clustering with the following two requirements. First; clusteringshould be processed efficiently since it can be frequently requested. Second; huge amountsof trajectory data must be accommodated; as they will accumulate constantly. Anincremental clustering framework for trajectories is proposed in this paper. It contains twoparts: online micro-cluster maintenance and offline macro-cluster creation. For online part;when a new bunch of trajectories arrives; each trajectory is simplified into a set of directed …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,108

Temporal outlier detection in vehicle traffic data,Xiaolei Li; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han; Jae-Gil Lee,Outlier detection in vehicle traffic data is a practical problem that has gained traction latelydue to an increasing capability to track moving vehicles in city roads. In contrast to otherapplications; this particular domain includes a very dynamic dimension: time. Many existingalgorithms have studied the problem of outlier detection at a single instant in time. This studyproposes a method for detecting temporal outliers with an emphasis on historical similaritytrends between data points. Outliers are calculated from drastic changes in the trends.Experiments with real world traffic data show that this approach is effective and efficient.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Differentially private data cubes: optimizing noise sources and consistency,Bolin Ding; Marianne Winslett; Jiawei Han; Zhenhui Li,Abstract Data cubes play an essential role in data analysis and decision support. In a datacube; data from a fact table is aggregated on subsets of the table's dimensions; forming acollection of smaller tables called cuboids. When the fact table includes sensitive data suchas salary or diagnosis; publishing even a subset of its cuboids may compromise individuals'privacy. In this paper; we address this problem using differential privacy (DP); whichprovides provable privacy guarantees for individuals by adding noise to query answers. Wechoose an initial subset of cuboids to compute directly from the fact table; injecting DP noiseas usual; and then compute the remaining cuboids from the initial set. Given a fixed privacyguarantee; we show that it is NP-hard to choose the initial set of cuboids so that the maximalnoise over all published cuboids is minimized; or so that the number of cuboids with noise …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,101
Geo-friends recommendation in gps-based cyber-physical social network,Xiao Yu; Ang Pan; Lu-An Tang; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,The popularization of GPS-enabled mobile devices provides social network researchers ataste of cyber-physical social network in advance. Traditional link prediction methods aredesigned to find friends solely relying on social network information. With location andtrajectory data available; we can generate more accurate and geographically related results;and help web-based social service users find more friends in the real world. Aiming torecommend geographically related friends in social network; a three-step statisticalrecommendation approach is proposed for GPS-enabled cyber-physical social network.

Analyzing such data has deep implications in many applications; such as; ecologicalstudy; traffic control; mobile communication management; and climatological forecast.

Keyword extraction for social snippets,Zhenhui Li; Ding Zhou; Yun-Fang Juan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Today; a huge amount of text is being generated for social purposes on socialnetworking services on the Web. Unlike traditional documents; such text is usually extremelyshort and tends to be informal. Analysis of such text benefit many applications such asadvertising; search; and content filtering. In this work; we study one traditional text miningtask on such new form of text; that is extraction of meaningful keywords. We propose severalintuitive yet useful features and experiment with various classification models. Evaluation isconducted on Facebook data. Performances of various features and models are reportedand compared.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,63
Correlated multi-label feature selection,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Multi-label learning studies the problem where each instance is associated with aset of labels. There are two challenges in multi-label learning:(1) the labels areinterdependent and correlated; and (2) the data are of high dimensionality. In this paper; weaim to tackle these challenges in one shot. In particular; we propose to learn the labelcorrelation and do feature selection simultaneously. We introduce a matrix-variate Normalprior distribution on the weight vectors of the classifier to model the label correlation. Ourgoal is to find a subset of features; based on which the label correlation regularized loss oflabel ranking is minimized. The resulting multi-label feature selection problem is a mixedinteger programming; which is reformulated as quadratically constrained linearprogramming (QCLP). It can be solved by cutting plane algorithm; in each iteration of …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,51
Mining periodic behaviors of object movements for animal and biological sustainability studies,Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han; Bolin Ding; Roland Kays,Abstract Periodicity is one of the most frequently occurring phenomena for moving objects.Animals usually have periodic movement behaviors; such as daily foraging behaviors oryearly migration behaviors. Such periodic behaviors are the keys to understand animalmovement and they also reflect the seasonal; climate; or environmental changes of theecosystem. However; periodic behaviors could be complicated; involving multipleinterleaving periods; partial time span; and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper;we address the problem of mining periodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect the periods in complex movements; and how to mine periodicbehaviors. A period is usually a single value; such as 24 h. And a periodic behavior is astatistical description of the periodic movement for one specific period. For example; we …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,45
Mining event periodicity from incomplete observations,Zhenhui Li; Jingjing Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Advanced technology in GPS and sensors enables us to track physical events; suchas human movements and facility usage. Periodicity analysis from the recorded data is animportant data mining task which provides useful insights into the physical events andenables us to report outliers and predict future behaviors. To mine periodicity in an event; wehave to face real-world challenges of inherently complicated periodic behaviors andimperfect data collection problem. Specifically; the hidden temporal periodic behaviors couldbe oscillating and noisy; and the observations of the event could be incomplete. In thispaper; we propose a novel probabilistic measure for periodicity and design a practicalmethod to detect periods. Our method has thoroughly considered the uncertainties andnoises in periodic behaviors and is provably robust to incomplete observations …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,41
Linear discriminant dimensionality reduction,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Fisher criterion has achieved great success in dimensionality reduction. Tworepresentative methods based on Fisher criterion are Fisher Score and Linear DiscriminantAnalysis (LDA). The former is developed for feature selection while the latter is designed forsubspace learning. In the past decade; these two approaches are often studiedindependently. In this paper; based on the observation that Fisher score and LDA arecomplementary; we propose to integrate Fisher score and LDA in a unified framework;namely Linear Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LDDR). We aim at finding a subset offeatures; based on which the learnt linear transformation via LDA maximizes the Fishercriterion. LDDR inherits the advantages of Fisher score and LDA and is able to do featureselection and subspace learning simultaneously. Both Fisher score and LDA can be seen …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,38

There is an imminent need for scalable andflexible data analysis over moving-object information; and thus mining moving-object datahas become one of major challenges in data mining.

Learning a Kernel for Multi-Task Clustering.,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Multi-task learning has received increasing attention in the past decade. Manysupervised multi-task learning methods have been proposed; while unsupervised multitasklearning is still a rarely studied problem. In this paper; we propose to learn a kernel for multi-task clustering. Our goal is to learn a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space; in which thegeometric structure of the data in each task is preserved; while the data distributions of anytwo tasks are as close as possible. This is formulated as a unified kernel learning framework;under which we study two types of kernel learning: nonparametric kernel learning andspectral kernel design. Both types of kernel learning can be solved by linear programming.Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that kernel k-means on thelearned kernel can achieve better clustering results than traditional single-task clustering …,AAAI,2011,34
Semantic annotation of mobility data using social media,Fei Wu; Zhenhui Li; Wang-Chien Lee; Hongjian Wang; Zhuojie Huang,Abstract Recent developments in sensors; GPS and smart phones have provided us with alarge amount of mobility data. At the same time; large-scale crowd-generated social mediadata; such as geo-tagged tweets; provide rich semantic information about locations andevents. Combining the mobility data and surrounding social media data enables us tosemantically understand why a person travels to a location at a particular time (eg; attendinga local event or visiting a point of interest). Previous research on mobility data mining hasbeen mainly focused on mining patterns using only the mobility data. In this paper; we studythe problem of using social media to annotate mobility data. As social media data is oftennoisy; the key research problem lies in using the right model to retrieve only the relevantwords with respect to a mobility record. We propose frequency-based method; Gaussian …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,29
PGT: Measuring mobility relationship using personal; global and temporal factors,Hongjian Wang; Zhenhui Li; Wang-Chien Lee,Rich location data of mobile users collected from smart phones and location-based socialnetworking services enable us to measure the mobility relationship strength based on theirinteractions in the physical world. A commonly-used measure for such relationship is thefrequency of meeting events (ie; Co-locate at the same time). That is; the more frequently twopersons meet; the stronger their mobility relationship is. However; we argue that not all themeeting events are equally important in measuring the mobility relationship and propose toconsider personal and global factors to differentiate meeting events. Personal factor modelsthe probability for an individual user to visit a certain location; whereas the global factormodels the popularity of a location based on the behavior of general public. In addition; weintroduce the temporal factor to further consider the time gaps between meeting events …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,25
Attraction and avoidance detection from movements,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Fei Wu; Tobias Kin Hou Lei; Roland Kays; Margaret C Crofoot,Abstract With the development of positioning technology; movement data has becomewidely available nowadays. An important task in movement data analysis is to mine therelationships among moving objects based on their spatiotemporal interactions. Among allrelationship types; attraction and avoidance are arguably the most natural ones. However;rather surprisingly; there is no existing method that addresses the problem of miningsignificant attraction and avoidance relationships in a well-defined and unified framework. Inthis paper; we propose a novel method to measure the significance value of relationshipbetween any two objects by examining the background model of their movements viapermutation test. Since permutation test is computationally expensive; two effective pruningstrategies are developed to reduce the computation time. Furthermore; we show how the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,17
Mining GPS data for trajectory recommendation,Peifeng Yin; Mao Ye; Wang-Chien Lee; Zhenhui Li,Abstract The wide use of GPS sensors in smart phones encourages people to record theirpersonal trajectories and share them with others in the Internet. A recommendation serviceis needed to help people process the large quantity of trajectories and select potentiallyinteresting ones. The GPS trace data is a new format of information and few works focus onbuilding user preference profiles on it. In this work we proposed a trajectoryrecommendation framework and developed three recommendation methods; namely;Activity-Based Recommendation (ABR); GPS-Based Recommendation (GBR) and HybridRecommendation. The ABR recommends trajectories purely relying on activity tags. ForGBR; we proposed a generative model to construct user profiles based on GPS traces. TheHybrid recommendation combines the ABR and GBR. We finally conducted extensive …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,14
Mining following relationships in movement data,Zhenhui Li; Fei Wu; Margaret C Crofoot,Movement data have been widely collected from GPS and sensors; allowing us to analyzehow moving objects interact in terms of space and time and to learn about the relationshipsthat exist among the objects. In this paper; we investigate an interesting relationship that hasnot been adequately studied so far: the following relationship. Intuitively; a follower hassimilar trajectories as its leader but always arrives at a location with some time lag. Thechallenges in mining the following relationship are:(1) the following time lag is usuallyunknown and varying;(2) the trajectories of the follower and leader are not identical; and (3)the relationship is subtle and only occurs in a short period of time. In this paper; we proposea simple but practical method that addresses all these challenges. It requires only twointuitive parameters and is able to mine following time intervals between two trajectories …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,13
Crime Rate Inference with Big Data,Hongjian Wang; Zhenhui Li; Daniel Kifer; Corina Graif,Abstract Crime is one of the most important social problems in the country; affecting publicsafety; children development; and adult socioeconomic status. Understanding what factorscause higher crime is critical for policy makers in their efforts to reduce crime and increasecitizens' life quality. We tackle a fundamental problem in our paper: crime rate inference atthe neighborhood level. Traditional approaches have used demographics and geographicalinfluences to estimate crime rates in a region. With the fast development of positioningtechnology and prevalence of mobile devices; a large amount of modern urban data havebeen collected and such big data can provide new perspectives for understanding crime. Inthis paper; we used large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data in the city ofChicago; IL in the USA.

Spatiotemporal pattern mining: algorithms and applications,Zhenhui Li,Abstract With the fast development of positioning technology; spatiotemporal data hasbecome widely available nowadays. Mining patterns from spatiotemporal data has manyimportant applications in human mobility understanding; smart transportation; urbanplanning and ecological studies. In this chapter; we provide an overview of spatiotemporaldata mining methods. We classify the patterns into three categories:(1) individual periodicpattern;(2) pairwise movement pattern and (3) aggregative patterns over multipletrajectories. This chapter states the challenges of pattern discovery; reviews the state-of-the-art methods and also discusses the limitations of existing methods.,*,2014,12
MoveMine 2.0: mining object relationships from movement data,Fei Wu; Tobias Kin Hou Lei; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract The development in positioning technology has enabled us to collect a hugeamount of movement data from moving objects; such as human; animals; and vehicles. Thedata embed rich information about the relationships among moving objects and haveapplications in many fields; eg; in ecological study and human behavioral study. Previously;we have proposed a system MoveMine that integrates several start-of-art movement miningmethods. However; it does not include recent methods on relationship pattern mining. Thus;we propose to extend MoveMine to MoveMine 2.0 by adding substantial new methods inmining dynamic relationship patterns. Newly added methods focus on two types of pairwiserelationship patterns:(i) attraction/avoidance relationship; and (ii) following pattern.

Mining periodicity from dynamic and incomplete spatiotemporal data,Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract As spatiotemporal data becomes widely available; mining and understanding suchdata have gained a lot of attention recently. Among all important patterns; periodicity isarguably the most frequently happening one for moving objects. Finding periodic behaviorsis essential to understanding the activities of objects; and to predict future movements anddetect anomalies in trajectories. However; periodic behaviors in spatiotemporal data couldbe complicated; involvingmultiple interleaving periods; partial time span; and spatiotemporalnoises and outliers. Even worse; due to the limitations of positioning technology or itsvarious kinds of deployments; real movement data is often highly incomplete and sparse. Inthis chapter; we discuss existing techniques to mine periodic behaviors from spatiotemporaldata; with a focus on tackling the aforementioned difficulties risen in real applications. In …,*,2014,11
Mining significant time intervals for relationship detection,Zhenhui Li; Cindy Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatio-temporal data collected from GPS have become an important resource tostudy the relationships of moving objects. While previous studies focus on mining objectsbeing together for a long time; discovering real-world relationships; such as friends orcolleagues in human trajectory data; is a fundamentally different challenge. For example; itis possible that two individuals are friends but do not spend a lot of time being together everyday. However; spending just one or two hours together at a location away from work on aSaturday night could be a strong indicator of friend relationship. Based on the aboveobservations; in this paper we aim to analyze and detect semantically meaningfulrelationships in a supervised way. That is; with an interested relationship in mind; a user canlabel some object pairs with and without such relationship. From labeled pairs; we will …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,11
Locality preserving feature learning,Quanquan Gu; Marina Danilevsky; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) has been quite successful in tackling documentanalysis problems; such as clustering or classification. The approach relies on the LocalityPreserving Criterion; which preserves the locality of the data points. However; LPI takesevery word in a data corpus into account; even though many words may not be useful fordocument clustering. To overcome this problem; we propose an approach called LocalityPreserving Feature Learning (LPFL); which incorporates feature selection into LPI.Specifically; we aim to find a subset of features; and learn a linear transformation to optimizethe Locality Preserving Criterion based on these features. The resulting optimizationproblem is a mixed integer programming problem; which we relax into a constrainedFrobenius norm minimization problem; and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction …,Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2012,10
Can back-of-the-book indexes be automatically created?,Zhaohui Wu; Zhenhui Li; Prasenjit Mitra; C Lee Giles,Abstract Automatic creation of back-of-the-book indexes remains one of the few manualtasks related to publishing. Inspired by how human indexers work on back-of-the-bookindexes creation; we present a new domain-independent; corpus-free and training-freeautomation approach. Given a book; the index terms will be sequentially selected accordingto an indexability score encoded by the structure information residing in a book as well as anovel context-aware term informativeness measurement utilizing the power of the webknowledge base such as Wikipedia. By extensive experiments on books from variousdomains; we show our approach to be a more effective and practical than ones that usedprevious keyword extraction and supervised learning.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,9
Where did you go: Personalized annotation of mobility records,Fei Wu; Zhenhui Li,Abstract Recent advances in positioning technology have generated massive volume ofhuman mobility data. At the same time; large amount of spatial context data are availableand provide us with rich context information. Combining the mobility data with surroundingspatial context enables us to understand the semantics of the mobility records; eg; what is auser doing at a location; eg; dining at a restaurant or attending a football game). In thispaper; we aim to answer this question by annotating the mobility records with surroundingvenues that were actually visited by the user. The problem is non-trivial due to highambiguity of surrounding contexts. Unlike existing methods that annotate each locationrecord independently; we propose to use all historical mobility records to capture userpreferences; which results in more accurate annotations.

Searching for anomalous methane in shallow groundwater near shale gas wells,Zhenhui Li; Cheng You; Matthew Gonzales; Anna K Wendt; Fei Wu; Susan L Brantley,Abstract Since the 1800s; natural gas has been extracted from wells drilled into conventionalreservoirs. Today; gas is also extracted from shale using high-volume hydraulic fracturing(HVHF). These wells sometimes leak methane and must be re-sealed with cement. Someresearchers argue that methane concentrations; C; increase in groundwater near shale-gaswells and that “fracked” wells leak more than conventional wells. We developed techniquesto mine datasets of groundwater chemistry in Pennsylvania townships where contaminationhad been reported. Values of C measured in shallow private water wells were discovered toincrease with proximity to faults and to conventional; but not shale-gas; wells in the entirearea. However; in small subareas; C increased with proximity to some shale-gas wells.

A simple baseline for travel time estimation using large-scale trip data,Hongjian Wang; Yu-Hsuan Kuo; Daniel Kifer; Zhenhui Li,Abstract The increased availability of large-scale trajectory data provides rich information forthe study of urban dynamics. For example; New York City Taxi & Limousine Commissionregularly releases source/destination information of taxi trips; where 173 million taxi tripsreleased for Year 2013 [1]. Such a big dataset provides us potential new perspectives toaddress the traditional traffic problems. In this paper; we study the travel time estimationproblem. Instead of following the traditional route-based travel time estimation; we proposeto simply use a large amount of taxi trips without using the intermediate trajectory points toestimate the travel time between source and destination. Our experiments show verypromising results. The proposed big data-driven approach significantly outperforms bothstate-of-the-art route-based method and online map services.

Enabling Direct Interest-Aware Audience Selection,Ariel Fuxman; Anitha Kannan; Zhenhui Li; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Advertisers typically have a fairly accurate idea of the interests of their targetaudience. However; today's online advertising systems are unable to leverage thisinformation. The reasons are two-fold. First; there is no agreed upon vocabulary of interestsfor advertisers and advertising systems to communicate. More importantly; advertisingsystems lack a mechanism for mapping users to the interest vocabulary. In this paper; wetackle both problems. We present a system for direct interest-aware audience selection. Thissystem takes the query histories of search engine users as input; extracts their interests; anddescribes them with interpretable labels. The labels are not drawn from a predefinedtaxonomy; but rather dynamically generated from the query histories; and are thus easy forthe advertisers to interpret and use for targeting users. In addition; the system enables …,a) A,2012,3
Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Demand Prediction,Huaxiu Yao; Fei Wu; Jintao Ke; Xianfeng Tang; Yitian Jia; Siyu Lu; Pinghua Gong; Jieping Ye,Abstract: Taxi demand prediction is an important building block to enabling intelligenttransportation systems in a smart city. An accurate prediction model can help the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis on streets which wasteenergy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the increasing popularity of taxi requestingservices such as Uber and Didi Chuxing (in China); we are able to collect large-scale taxidemand data continuously. How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction isan interesting and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostlyrely on time series forecasting techniques; which fail to model the complex non-linear spatialand temporal relations.

Detecting the effects of coal mining; acid rain; and natural gas extraction in Appalachian basin streams in Pennsylvania (USA) through analysis of barium and sulfate...,Xianzeng Niu; Anna Wendt; Zhenhui Li; Amal Agarwal; Lingzhou Xue; Matthew Gonzales; Susan L Brantley,Abstract To understand how extraction of different energy sources impacts water resourcesrequires assessment of how water chemistry has changed in comparison with thebackground values of pristine streams. With such understanding; we can develop betterwater quality standards and ecological interpretations. However; determination of pristinebackground chemistry is difficult in areas with heavy human impact. To learn to do this; wecompiled a master dataset of sulfate and barium concentrations ([SO 4];[Ba]) inPennsylvania (PA; USA) streams from publically available sources. These elements werechosen because they can represent contamination related to oil/gas and coal; respectively.We applied changepoint analysis (ie; likelihood ratio test) to identify pristine streams; whichwe defined as streams with a low variability in concentrations as measured over years …,Environmental geochemistry and health,2017,1

Discovery of causal time intervals,Zhenhui Li; Guanjie Zheng; Amal Agarwal; Lingzhou Xue; Thomas Lauvaux,Abstract Causality analysis; beyond “mere” correlations; has become increasingly importantfor scientific discoveries and policy decisions. Many of these real-world applications involvetime series data. A key observation is that the causality between time series could varysignificantly over time. For example; a rain could cause severe traffic jams during the rushhours; but has little impact on the traffic at midnight. However; previous studies mostly look atthe whole time series when determining the causal relationship between them. Instead; wepropose to detect the partial time intervals with causality. As it is time consuming toenumerate all time intervals and test causality for each interval; we further propose anefficient algorithm that can avoid unnecessary computations based on the bounds of F-testin the Granger causality test. We use both synthetic datasets and real datasets to …,*,2017,1
Modeling Spatial-Temporal Dynamics for Traffic Prediction,Huaxiu Yao; Xianfeng Tang; Hua Wei; Guanjie Zheng; Yanwei Yu; Zhenhui Li,Abstract: Spatial-temporal prediction has many applications such as climate forecasting andurban planning. In particular; traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention in data miningresearch field for the growing traffic related datasets and for its impacts in real-worldapplications. For example; an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies topre-allocate taxis to meet with commuting demands. The key challenge of traffic predictionlies in how to model the complex spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper; we maketwo important observations which have not been considered by previous studies:(1) thespatial dependency between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependencyfollows strong periodicity but is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. Basedon these two observations; we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.01254,2018,*
Non-Stationary Model for Crime Rate Inference Using Modern Urban Data,Hongjian Wang; Huaxiu Yao; Daniel Kifer; Corina Graif; Zhenhui Li,Crime is one of the most important social problems in the country; affecting public safety;children development; and adult socioeconomic status. We tackle a fundamental problem inour paper: crime rate inference at the neighborhood level. Traditional approaches haveused demographics and geographical influences to estimate crime rates in a region. Withthe fast development of positioning technology and prevalence of mobile devices; a largeamount of modern urban data have been collected and such big data can provide newperspectives for understanding crime. In this paper; we used large-scale Point-Of-Interestdata and taxi flow data in the city of Chicago; IL in the USA. We observed significantlyimproved performance in crime rate inference compared to using traditional features. Suchan improvement is consistent over multiple years. We also show that these new features …,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2017,*
Region Representation Learning via Mobility Flow,Hongjian Wang; Zhenhui Li,Abstract Increasing amount of urban data are being accumulated and released to public; thisenables us to study the urban dynamics and address urban issues such as crime; traffic; andquality of living. In this paper; we are interested in learning vector representations for regionsusing the large-scale taxi flow data. These representations could help us better measure therelationship strengths between regions; and the relationships can be used to better modelthe region properties. Different from existing studies; we propose to consider both temporaldynamics and multi-hop transitions in learning the region representations. We propose tojointly learn the representations from a flow graph and a spatial graph. Such a combinedgraph could simulate individual movements and also addresses the data sparsity issue. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our method using three different real datasets.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Structural Event Detection from Log Messages,Fei Wu; Pranay Anchuri; Zhenhui Li,Abstract A wide range of modern web applications are only possible because of thecomposable nature of the web services they are built upon. It is; therefore; often critical toensure proper functioning of these web services. As often; the server-side of web services isnot directly accessible; several log message based analysis have been developed tomonitor the status of web services. Existing techniques focus on using clusters of messages(log patterns) to detect important system events. We argue that meaningful system eventsare often representable by groups of cohesive log messages and the relationships amongthese groups. We propose a novel method to mine structural events as directed workflowgraphs (where nodes represent log patterns; and edges represent relations amongpatterns). The structural events are inclusive and correspond to interpretable episodes in …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*
Contextual Spatial Outlier Detection with Metric Learning,Guanjie Zheng; Susan L Brantley; Thomas Lauvaux; Zhenhui Li,Abstract Hydraulic fracturing (or" fracking") is a revolutionary well stimulation technique forshale gas extraction; but has spawned controversy in environmental contamination. Ifmethane from gas wells leaks extensively; this greenhouse gas can impact drinking waterwells and enhance global warming. Our work is motivated by this heated debate onenvironmental issue and focuses on general data analytical techniques to detect anomalousspatial data samples (eg; water samples related to potential leakages). Specifically; wepropose a spatial outlier detection method based on contextual neighbors. Different fromexisting work; our approach utilizes both spatial attributes and non-spatial contextualattributes to define neighbors. We further use robust metric learning to combine differentcontextual attributes in order to find meaningful neighbors. Our technique can be applied …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*
Data Mining Techniques Applied to Marcellus Shale Gas Development in Northeastern Pennsylvania,Anna Wendt; Zhenhui Li; Cheng You; Matthew Gonzales; Fei Wu; Susan Brantley,Abstract The rapid development in the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing inPennsylvania; USA; since 2004 has led to public scrutiny of water quality. To investigatecontroversies about whether methane concentration in groundwater increases near gaswells; we studied an area with reported problems in Bradford County; Pennsylvania where alarge publically available groundwater dataset has been published. Statistical investigationwas facilitated by a new data mining technique for analysis of spatial patterns; which isespecially useful in this region where drilling-related incidents are rare and sites of naturalmethane emission are common. Results show that over the whole study area with 1690analyses; methane concentrations correlate with the distance to conventional; but notunconventional; wells. A smaller subarea (730 analyses) showed a very weak; but …,AAPG Annual Convention and Exhibition,*,*
