Deadline scheduling for real-time systems: EDF and related algorithms,John A Stankovic; Marco Spuri; Krithi Ramamritham; Giorgio C Buttazzo,Many real-time systems rely on static scheduling algorithms. This includes cyclic scheduling;rate monotonic scheduling and fixed schedules created by off-line scheduling techniquessuch as dynamic programming; heuristic search; and simulated annealing. However; formany real-time systems; static scheduling algorithms are quite restrictive and inflexible. Forexample; highly automated agile manufacturing; command; control and communications;and distributed real-time multimedia applications all operate over long lifetimes and in highlynon-deterministic environments. Dynamic real-time scheduling algorithms are moreappropriate for these systems and are used in such systems. Many of these algorithms arebased on earliest deadline first (EDF) policies. There exists a wealth of literature on EDF-based scheduling with many extensions to deal with sophisticated issues such as …,*,2012,775
Real-time databases,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Data in real-time databases has to be logically consistent as well as temporallyconsistent. The latter arises from the need to preserve the temporal validity of data items thatreflect the state of the environment that is being controlled by the system. Some of the timingconstraints on the transactions that process real-time data come from this need. Theseconstraints; in turn; necessitate time-cognizant transaction processing so that transactionscan be processed to meet their deadlines. This paper explores the issues in real-timedatabase systems and presents an overview of the state of the art. After introducing thecharacteristics of data and transactions in real-time databases; we discuss issues that relateto the processing of time-constrained transactions. Specifically; we examine differentapproaches to resolving contention over data and processing resources. We also explore …,Distributed and parallel databases,1993,767
Scheduling algorithms and operating systems support for real-time systems,Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,This paper summarizes the state of the real-time field in the areas of scheduling andoperating system kernels. Given the vast amount of work that has been done by both theoperations research and computer science communities in the scheduling area; we discussfour paradigms underlying the scheduling approaches and present several exemplars ofeach. The four paradigms are: static table-driven scheduling; static priority preemptivescheduling; dynamic planning-based scheduling; and dynamic best effort scheduling. In theoperating system context; we argue that most of the proprietary commercial kernels as wellas real-time extensions to time-sharing operating system kernels do not fit the needs ofpredictable realtime systems. We discuss several research kernels that are currently beingbuilt to explicitly meet the needs of real-time applications.,Proceedings of the IEEE,1994,579
Efficient scheduling algorithms for real-time multiprocessor systems,Krithi Ramamritham; John A.  Stankovic; P-F Shiah,Efficient scheduling algorithms based on heuristic functions are developed for scheduling aset of tasks on a multiprocessor system. The tasks are characterized by worst-casecomputation times; deadlines; and resources requirements. Starting with an empty partialschedule; each step of the search extends the current partial schedule by including one ofthe tasks yet to be scheduled. The heuristic functions used in the algorithm actively direct thesearch for a feasible schedule; ie they help choose the task that extends the current partialschedule. Two scheduling algorithms are evaluated by simulation. To extend the currentpartial schedule; one of the algorithms considers; at each step of the search; all the tasksthat are yet to be scheduled as candidates. The second focuses its attention on a smallsubset of tasks with the shortest deadlines. The second algorithm is shown to be very …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed systems,1990,508
Distributed scheduling of tasks with deadlines and resource requirements,Krithi Ramamritham; John A.  Stankovic; Wei Zhao,A set of four heuristic algorithms is presented to schedule tasks that have headlines andresource requirements in a distributed system. When a task arrives at a node; the localscheduler at that node attempts to guarantee that the task will complete execution on thatnode before its deadline. If the attempt fails; the scheduling components on individual nodescooperate to determine which other node in the system has sufficient resource surplus toguarantee the task. Simulation studies are performed to compare the performance of thesealgorithms with respect to each other as well to two baselines. The first baseline is thenoncooperative algorithm where a task that cannot be guaranteed locally is not sent to anyother node. The second is an (ideal) algorithm that behaves exactly like the biddingalgorithm but incurs no communication overheads. The simulation studies examine how …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1989,454

The spring kernel: A new paradigm for real-time systems,John A.  Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,A real-time operating system kernel; called the Spring kernel; that provides some of thebasic support required for large; complex; next-generation real-time systems; especially inmeeting timing constraints; is presented. The approach meets the need to build predictableyet flexible real-time systems. Most current real-time operating systems contain the samebasic paradigms found in time-sharing operating systems and often use a basic priority-scheduling mechanism that provides no direct support for meeting timing constraints. Springuses two criteria to classify tasks' interaction with and effects on the environment: importanceand timing requirements. Implementation experience with Spring is described.,IEEE software,1991,379
Dynamic task scheduling in hard real-time distributed systems,Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Our scheme for distributed dynamic scheduling requires one schedulerper node. The schedulersinteract todetermine assignment for a newly arriving task. Associated with a node ina distributedsystem is a set; possiblynull; of periodic tasks guaranteed toexecute on that node. We assumethatthe characteristics of periodic tasksare known in advance and that suchtasks must meet theirdeadlines. Theexistence of enough processing powerat a node for all periodic tasks to meettheirdeadlines is verified at system initialization time. In addition to theperiodic tasks; we allow forthe arrival of nonperiodic tasks at any timeand attempt to guarantee these tasksdynamically;in the presence ofperiodic tasks and on a network-widebasis … In a multiprocessingenvironment;optimal scheduling is an NP-hardproblem and thus computationallyintractable.12 The problem is evenharder for loosely coupled distributedsystems.

Synthesis of extended transaction models using ACTA,Panos K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract ACTA is a comprehensive transaction framework that facilitates the formaldescription of properties of extended transaction models. Specifically; using ACTA; one canspecify and reason about (1) the effects of transactions on objects and (2) the interactionsbetween transactions. This article presents ACTA as a tool for the synthesis of extendedtransaction models; one which supports the development and analysis of new extendedtransaction models in a systematic manner. Here; this is demonstrated by deriving newtransaction definitions (1) by modifying the specifications of existing transaction models;(2)by combining the specifications of existing models; and (3) by starting from first principles. Toexemplify the first; new models are synthesized from atomic transactions and jointransactions. To illustrate the second; we synthesize a model that combines aspect of the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1994,336
What is predictability for real-time systems?,John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,Conclusion In summary; predictability in real-time systems has been defined in many ways.For static real-time systems we can predict the overall system performance over large timeframes (even over the life of the system) as well as predict the performance of individualtasks. If the prediction is that 100% of all tasks over the entire life of the system will meet theirdeadlines; then the system is predictable without resorting to any stochastic evaluation. Indynamic real-time systems we must resort to a stochastic evaluation for part of theperformance evaluation. Predictability for these systems should mean that we are able tosatisfy the timing requirements of critical tasks with 100% guarantee over the life of thesystem; be able to assess overall system performance over various time frames (a stochasticevaluation); and be able to assess individual task and task group performance at different …,*,1990,319
Preemptive scheduling under time and resource constraints,Wei Zhao; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,We consider the problem of scheduling a set of n preemptable tasks in a system having rresources. Each task has an arbitrary; but known; worst case processing time and adeadline; and may request simultaneous use of a number of resources. A resource can beused either in shared mode or exclusive mode. In this paper; we develop and evaluatealgorithms for determining whether or not a set of preemptive tasks is schedulable in such areal-time system; and if so; determining a schedule for it. This scheduling problem is knownto be computationally intensive. In many real-time application environments; tasks arescheduled dynamically; and hence the scheduling algorithms used must have low run-timecosts. To keep run-time costs low; we propose the use of suboptimal but practical algorithmsthat employ computationally simple heuristics.

Scheduling tasks with resource requirements in hard real-time systems,Wei Zhao; Krithi Ramamritham; John A.  Stankovic,This paper describes a heuristic approach for solving the problem of dynamically schedulingtasks in a real-time system where tasks have deadlines and general resource requirements.The crux of our approach lies in the heuristic function used to select the task to be schedulednext. The heuristic function is composed of three weighted factors. These factors explicitlyconsider information about real-time constraints of tasks and their utilization of resources.Simulation studies show that the weights for the various factors in the heuristic function haveto be fine-tuned in order to obtain a degree of success in the range of 75-88 percent of thatobtained via exhaustive search. However; modifying the approach to use limitedbacktracking improves the degree of success substantially to as high as 99.5 percent. Thisimprovement is observed even when the initial set of weights are not tailored for a …,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1987,311
Semantics-based concurrency control: Beyond commutativity,BR Badrinath; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The concurrency of transactions executing on atomic data types can be enhancedthrough the use of semantic information about operations defined on these types. Hitherto;commutativity of operations has been exploited to provide enchanced concurrency whileavoiding cascading aborts. We have identified a property known as recoverability which canbe used to decrease the delay involved in processing noncommuting operations while stillavoiding cascading aborts. When an invoked operation is recoverable with respect to anuncommitted operation; the invoked operation can be executed by forcing a commitdependency between the invoked operation and the uncommitted operation; the transactioninvoking the operation will not have to wait for the uncommitted operation to abort or commit.Further; this commit dependency only affects the order in which the operations should …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1992,301
ACTA: A framework for specifying and reasoning about transaction structure and behavior,Panayiotis K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Recently; a number of extensions to the traditional transaction model have beenproposed to support new information-intensive applications such as CAD/CAM and softwaredevelopment. However; these extended models capture only a subset of interactions thatcan be found in such applications; and represent only some of the points within the spectrumof interactions possible in competitive and cooperative environments. ACTA is aformalizable framework developed for characterizing the whole spectrum of interactions. TheACTA framework is not yet another transaction model; but is intended to unify the existingmodels. ACTA allows for specifying the structure and the behavior of transactions as well asfor reasoning about the concurrency and recovery properties of the transactions. In ACTA;the semantics of interactions are expressed in terms of transactions' effects on the commit …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1990,266
Verifying completeness of relational query results in data publishing,HweeHwa Pang; Arpit Jain; Krithi Ramamritham; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In data publishing; the owner delegates the role of satisfying user queries to a third-party publisher. As the publisher may be untrusted or susceptible to attacks; it could produceincorrect query results. In this paper; we introduce a scheme for users to verify that theirquery results are complete (ie; no qualifying tuples are omitted) and authentic (ie; all theresult values originated from the owner). The scheme supports range selection on key andnon-key attributes; project as well as join queries on relational databases. Moreover; theproposed scheme complies with access control policies; is computationally secure; and canbe implemented efficiently.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,261
Evaluation of a flexible task scheduling algorithm for distributed hard real-time systems,John A Stankovic; Krithivasan Ramamritham; Shengchang Cheng,Most systems which are required to operate under severe real-time constraints assume thatall tasks and their characteristics are known a priori. Scheduling of such tasks can be donestatistically. Further; scheduling algorithms operating under such conditions are usuallylimited to multiprocessor configurations. The authors present a scheduling algorithm whichworks dynamically and on loosely coupled distributed systems for tasks with hard real-timeconstraints; ie; the tasks must meet their deadlines. It uses a scheduling component local toevery node and a distributed scheduling scheme which is specifically suited to hard real-time constraints and other timing considerations.

Allocation and scheduling of complex periodic tasks,Krithi Ramamritham,A static algorithm for allocating and scheduling components of complex periodic tasksacross sites in distributed systems is discussed. Besides dealing with the periodicityconstraints (which have been the sole concern of many previous algorithms); this algorithmhandles precedence; communication; and fault-tolerance requirements of subtasks of thetasks. The algorithm determines the allocation of subtasks of periodic tasks to sites; thescheduled start times of subtasks allocated to a site; and the schedule for communicationalong the communication channel (s). Experimental evaluation of the algorithm shows thatthe heuristics and search techniques incorporated in the algorithm are extremely effective.Specifically; they show that; if a task set can be feasibly allocated and scheduled; thealgorithm is highly likely to find it without any backtracking during the search.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1990.

Materialized view selection and maintenance using multi-query optimization,Hoshi Mistry; Prasan Roy; S Sudarshan; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Materialized views have been found to be very effective at speeding up queries;and are increasingly being supported by commercial databases and data warehousesystems. However; whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse and the number ofmaterialized views are rapidly increasing; the time window available for maintainingmaterialized views is shrinking. These trends necessitate efficient techniques for themaintenance of materialized views. In this paper; we show how to find an efficient plan forthe maintenance of a set of materialized views; by exploiting common subexpressionsbetween different view maintenance expressions. In particular; we show how to efficientlyselect (a) expressions and indices that can be effectively shared; by transientmaterialization;(b) additional expressions and indices for permanent materialization; and …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,243

Specifically; the system movesfrom one mode of execution to another as its mission progresses.

Adaptive push-pull: disseminating dynamic web data,Pavan Deolasee; Amol Katkar; Ankur Panchbudhe; Krithi Ramamritham; Prashant Shenoy,ABSTRACT An important issue in the dissemination of time-varying web data such as sportsscores and stock prices is the maintenance of temporal coherency. In the case of serversadhering to the HTTP protocol; clients need to frequently pull the data based on thedynamics of the data and a user's coherency requirements. In contrast; servers that possesspush capability maintain state information pertaining to clients and push only those changesthat are of interest to a user. These two canonical techniques have complementaryproperties with respect to the level of temporal coherency maintained; communicationoverheads; state space overheads; and loss of coherency due to (server) failures.

Our first goal is to understand thebehavior of queries in the presence of conflicts and to show how ESR in fact is ageneralization of SR. So; using the ACTA framework; we formally express theintertransaction conflicts that are recognized by ESR and through that define ESR;analogous to the manner in which conflict-based serializability is defined. Secondly;expressions are derived for the amount of inconsistency (in a data item) viewed by a queryand its effects on the results of a query.

Efficient concurrency control for broadcast environments,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Arvind Nithrakashyap; Rajendran Sivasankaran; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract A crucial consideration in environments where data is broadcast to clients is the lowbandwidth available for clients to communicate with servers. Advanced applications in suchenvironments do need to read data that is mutually consistent as well as current. However;given the asymmetric communication capabilities and the needs of clients in mobileenvironments; traditional serializability-based approaches are too restrictive; unnecessary;and impractical. We thus propose the use of a weaker correctness criterion called updateconsistency and outline mechanisms based on this criterion that ensure (1) the mutualconsistency of data maintained by the server and read by clients; and (2) the currency ofdata read by clients. Using these mechanisms; clients can obtain data that is current andmutually consistent “off the air”; ie; without contacting the server to; say; obtain locks …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,175

Virtual time CSMA protocols for hard real-time communication,Wei Zhao; Krithi Ramamritham,We study virtual time CSMA protocols for hard real time communication systems; i; e.;systems where messages have explicit deadlines. In this class of CSMA protocols; eachnode maintains two clocks; a real time clock and a virtual time clock. Whenever a node findsthe channel to be idle; it resets its virtual clock. The virtual clock then runs at a higher ratethan the real clock. A node transmits a waiting message when the time on the virtual clock isequal to some parameter of the message. Using different message parameters inconjunction with the virtual clock; different transmission policies can be implemented. Inparticular; use of message arrival time; message length; message laxity; and messagedeadline implements FCFS; Minimum-Length-First; Minimum-Laxity-First; and Minimum-Deadline-First transmission policies; respectively.,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1987,170
The meaning and role of value in scheduling flexible real-time systems1,Alan Burns; Divya Prasad; Andrea Bondavalli; Felicita Di Giandomenico; Krithi Ramamritham; John Stankovic; Lorenzo Strigini,Abstract The real-time community is devoting considerable attention to flexible schedulingand adaptive systems. One popular means of increasing the flexibility; and henceeffectiveness; of real-time systems is to use value-based scheduling. It is surprisinghowever; how little attention has been devoted; in the scheduling field; to the actualassignment of value. This paper deals with value assignment and presents a framework forundertaking value-based scheduling and advises on the different methods that areavailable. A distinction is made between ordinal and cardinal value functions. Appropriatetechniques from utility theory are reviewed. An approach based on constant value modes isintroduced and evaluated via a case example.,Journal of systems architecture,2000,155

Both algorithms are based on a heuristic approach and explicitly account for boththe deadlines and criticality of tasks when making scheduling decisions. In analyzing thealgorithms; a performance metric called the weighted guarantee ratio is defined. It reflectsboth the percentage of tasks that make their deadlines and their relative worth to the system.The performance is analyzed by simulating the behavior of the algorithms as well as that ofseveral other pertinent baseline algorithms under a wide range of system conditionsincluding a nonhomogeneous task arrival rate.

A window protocol for transmission of time-constrained messages,Wei Zhao; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,The authors propose and study a window protocol suitable for transmitting time-constrainedmessages in a multiaccess network. The protocol differs from traditional window protocols inthat it explicitly takes time constraints into account. The window is formed on the basis of thelatest time to send a message (LS). A major advantage of the window protocol is that anewly arriving message is immediately considered for transmission if its LS is less than thatof all pending messages in the system. As a result; the protocol closely approximates theoptimal minimum-laxity-first policy. A performance evaluation through simulation shows thatthe protocol performs well in a wide range of environments; including under overloadedconditions.,IEEE Transactions on computers,1990,138

In WFMSs; data inconsistencies can arise due to: the interactionbetween steps of concurrent threads within a workflow (intra-workflow coordination); theinteraction between steps of concurrent workflows (inter-workflow coordination); and thepresence of failures. Since these problems have not received adequate attention; this paperfocuses on developing the necessary concepts and infrastructure to handle them. First; todeal with inter-and intra-workflow coordination requirements we have identified a set of highlevel building blocks. Secondly; to handle failures we propose a novel and pragmaticapproach called opportunistic compensation and re-execution that allows a workflowdesigner to customize workflow recovery from correctness as well as performance …,Data Engineering; 1998.

On using priority inheritance in real-time databases,Jiandong Huang; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley,The authors investigate solutions to the priority inversion problem in a real-time databasewhere two-phase locking is employed for concurrency control. They examine two basicschemes for addressing the priority inversion problem; one based on priority inheritance andthe other based on priority abort. The authors also study a new scheme; called conditionalpriority inheritance; which attempts to capitalize on the advantage of each of the two basicschemes. The performance studies; conducted on a real-time database testbed; indicatedthat the basic priority inheritance protocol is inappropriate for solving the priority inversionproblem in real-time database systems. The authors also show that the conditional priorityinheritance scheme and the priority abort scheme perform well for a wide range of systemworkloads.,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1991.

Scheduling messages with deadlines in multi-hop real-time sensor networks,Huan Li; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham,Consider a team of robots equipped with sensors that collaborate with one another toachieve a common goal. Sensors on robots produce periodic updates that must betransmitted to other robots and processed in real-time to enable such collaboration. Sincethe robots communicate with one another over an ad-hoc wireless network; we consider theproblem of providing timeliness guarantees for multihop message transmissions in such anetwork. We derive the effective deadline and the latest start time for per-hop messagetransmissions from the validity intervals of the sensor data and the constraints imposed bythe consuming task at the destination. Our technique schedules messages by carefullyexploiting spatial channel reuse for each per-hop transmission to avoid MAC layercollisions; so that deadline misses are minimized.

Resource reclaiming in multiprocessor real-time systems,Chia Shen; Krithi Ramamritham; John A.  Stankovic,Most real-time scheduling algorithms schedule tasks with regard to their worst casecomputation times. Resources reclaiming refers to the problem of utilizing the resources leftunused by a task when it executes in less than its worst case computation time; or when atask is deleted from the current schedule. Dynamic resource reclaiming algorithms that areeffective; avoid any run time anomalies; and have bounded overhead costs that areindependent of the number of tasks in the schedule are presented. Each task is assumed tohave a worst case computation time; a deadline; and a set of resource requirements. Thealgorithms utilize the information given in a multiprocessor task schedule and perform onlinelocal optimization. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated through simulationstudies.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1993,119
A taxonomy of correctness criteria in database applications,Krithi Ramamritham; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Whereas serializability captures database consistency requirements andtransaction correctness properties via a single notion; recent research has attempted tocome up with correctness criteria that view these two types of requirements independently.The search for more flexible correctness criteria is partily motivated by the introduction ofnew transaction models that extend the traditional atomic transaction model. Theseextensions came about because the atomic transaction model in conjunction withserializability is found to be very constraining when used in advanced applications (eg;design databases) that function in distributed; cooperative; and heterogeneousenvironments. In this article we develop a taxonomy of various correctness criteria that focuson database consistency requirements and transaction correctness properties from the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,1996,117
The PROMPT real-time commit protocol,Jayant R Haritsa; Krithi Ramamritham; Ramesh Gupta,We investigate the performance implications of providing transaction atomicity for firm-deadline real-time applications; operating on distributed data. Using a detailed simulationmodel; the real-time performance of a representative set of classical transaction commitprotocols is evaluated. The experimental results show that data distribution has a significantinfluence on real-time performance and that the choice of commit protocol clearly affects themagnitude of this influence. We also propose and evaluate a new commit protocol; PROMPT(Permits Reading Of Modified Prepared-data for Timeliness); that is specifically designed forthe real-time domain. PROMPT allows transactions to" optimistically" borrow; in a controlledmanner; the updated data of transactions currently in their commit phase. This controlledborrowing reduces the data inaccessibility and the priority inversion that is inherent in …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2000,116
Deriving deadlines and periods for real-time update transactions,Ming Xiong; Krithi Ramamritham,Typically; temporal validity of real-time data is maintained by periodic update transactions.We examine the problem of period and deadline assignment for these update transactionssuch that 1) these transactions can be guaranteed to complete by their deadlines and 2) theimposed CPU workload is minimized. To this end; we propose a novel approach; named theMore-Less approach. By applying this approach; updates occur with a period which is morethan the period obtained through traditional approaches; but with a deadline which is lessthan the traditional period. We show that the More-Less approach is better than existingapproaches in terms of schedulability and the imposed load. We examine the issue ofdetermining the assignment order in which transactions must be considered for period anddeadline assignment so that the resulting CPU workloads can be minimized. To this end …,IEEE Transactions on computers,2004,111

Adaptive dissemination of data in time-critical asymmetric communication environments,Jesus Fernandez; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The proliferation of new data-intensive applications in asymmetric communicationenvironments has led to an increasing interest in the development of push-basedtechniques; in which the information is broadcast to a large population of clients in order toachieve the most efficient use of the limited server and communication resources. It isimportant to note that quite often the data that is broadcast is time-critical in nature. Most ofthe related current research focuses on a pure push-based approach (Broadcast Disksmodel); where the transmission of data is done without allowing explicit requests from theusers. More recently; some bidirectional models incorporating a low-capacity uplink channelhave been proposed in order to increase the functionality of the Broadcast Disks model.However; the impact of integration of the uplink channel has been investigated using only …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2004,109
The spring scheduling coprocessor: a scheduling accelerator,Wayne Burleson; Jason Ko; Douglas Niehaus; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic; Gary Wallace; Charles Weems,The spring scheduling coprocessor is a novel very large scale integration (VLSI) acceleratorfor multiprocessor real-time systems. The coprocessor can be used for static as well asonline scheduling. Many different policies and their combinations can be used (eg; earliestdeadline first; highest value first; or resource-oriented policies such as earliest available timefirst). In this paper; we describe a coprocessor architecture; a CMOS implementation; animplementation of the host/coprocessor interface and a study of the overall performanceimprovement. We show that the current VLSI chip speeds up the main portion of thescheduling operation by over three orders of magnitude. We also present an overall systemimprovement analysis by accounting for the operating system overheads and identify thenext set of bottlenecks to improve.

Continuous media sharing in multimedia database systems,M Kamath K Ramamritham D Towsley,Abstract The timeliness and synchronization requirements of multimedia data demandefficient buffer management and disk access schemes for multimedia database sys-tems.The data rates involved are very high and despite the development of efficient storage andretrieval strate-gies; disk I/O is a potential bottleneck; which limits the number of concurrentsessions supported by a system. This calls for more efficient use of data that has alreadybeen brought into the buffer. We introduce the notion of continuous media caching; which isa simple and novel technique where data that have been played back by a user arepreserved in a controlled fashion for use by subsequent users requesting the same data. Wepresent heuristics to determine when continuous media sharing is beneficial and describethe buffer management algorithms. Simulation studies indicate that our technique …,Proc. 4th Int. Conf.

A local area network architecture for communication in distributed real-time systems,K Arvind; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Abstract Distributed real-time systems of the future will require specialized networkarchitectures that incorporate new classes of services and protocols in order to support time-constrained communication. In this paper; we propose a new local area network architecturefor such systems. This four-layered architecture is characterized by new classes ofconnection-oriented and connectionless services that take into account the timingconstraints of messages. We describe various aspects of the logical link control layer of thearchitecture and various real-time protocols that may be employed at the medium accesscontrol layer in order to support the new classes of services. We also describe ahomogeneous approach to the implementation of medium access control protocols tosupport both connection-oriented and connectionless services; based on a uniform …,Real-Time Systems,1991,109
Improving quality-of-control using flexible timing constraints: metric and scheduling,Pau Martí; Josep M Fuertes; Gerhard Fohler; Krithi Ramamritham,Closed-loop control systems are dynamic systems subject to perturbations. One of the mainconcerns of the control is to design controllers to correct or limit the deviation that transientperturbations cause in the controlled system response. The smaller and shorter thedeviation; the better the achieved performance. However; such controllers have beentraditionally implemented using fixed timing constraints (periods and deadlines). Thisprecludes controllers to execute dynamically; accordingly to the system dynamics; whichmay lead to sub-optimal implementations: although higher execution rates may bepreferable when reacting to perturbations in order to minimize the response deviations; theyimply wastage of resources when the system is in equilibrium. In this paper we argue anddemonstrate that the responsibility of maximizing the performance of closed-loop systems …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 2002. RTSS 2002. 23rd IEEE,2002,106
Determining redundancy levels for fault tolerant real-time systems,Fuxing Wang; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Many real-time systems have both performance requirements and reliability requirements.Performance is usually measured in terms of the value in completing tasks on time.Reliability is evaluated by hardware and software failure models. In many situations; thereare trade-offs between task performance and task reliability. Thus; a mathematicalassessment of performance-reliability trade-offs is necessary to evaluate the performance ofreal-time fault-tolerance systems. Assuming that the reliability of task execution is achievedthrough task replication; we present an approach that mathematically determines thereplication factor for tasks. Our approach is novel in that it is a task schedule based analysisrather than a state based analysis as found in other models. Because we use a taskschedule based analysis; we can provide a fast method to determine optimal redundancy …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1995,100
Priority inheritance in soft real-time databases,Jiandong Huang; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley; Bhaskar Purimetla,Abstract Due to resource sharing among tasks; priority inversion can occur during priority-driven preemptive scheduling. In this work; we investigate solutions to the priority inversionproblem in a soft real-time database environment where two-phhse locking is employed forconcurrency control. We examine two basic schemes for addressing the priority inversionproblem; one based on priority inheritance and the other based on priority abort. We alsostudy a new scheme; called conditional priority inheritance; which attempts to capitalize onthe advantages of each of the two basic schemes. In contrast with previous results obtainedin real-time operating systems; our performance studies; conducted on an actual real-timedatabase testbed; indicate that the basic priority inheritance protocol is inappropriate forsolving the priority inversion problem in real-time database systems.

Correctness issues in workflow management,Mohan Kamath; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Workflow management is a technique to integrate and automate the execution ofsteps that comprise a complex process; eg; a business process. Workflow managementsystems (WFMSs) primarily evolved from industry to cater to the growing demand for officeautomation tools among businesses. Coincidentally; database researchers developedseveral extended transaction models to handle similar applications. Although the goals ofboth the communities were the same; the issues they focused on were different. Theworkflow community primarily focused on modelling aspects to accurately capture the dataand control flow requirements between the steps that comprise a workflow; while thedatabase community focused on correctness aspects to ensure data consistency of sub-transactions that comprise a transaction. However; we now see a confluence of some of …,Distributed Systems Engineering,1996,94
Simple and integrated heuristic algorithms for scheduling tasks with time and resource constraints,Wei Zhao; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract We consider the problem of scheduling a set of n tasks in a system having rresources. Each task has an arbitrary; but known; processing time and a deadline; and mayrequest use of a number of resources. A resource can be used either in shared mode orexclusive mode. In this article; we study algorithms used for determining whether or not a setof tasks is schedulable in such a system; and if so; determining a schedule for it. Thisscheduling problem is known to be NP-complete and hence we methodically study a set ofheuristics that can be used by such an algorithm. Due to the complexity of the problem;simple heuristics do not perform satisfactorily. However; an algorithm that uses combinationsof these simple heuristics works very well compared to an optimal algorithm that takesexponential time complexity. For the combination that performs the best; we also …,Journal of Systems and Software,1987,94
Transquid: Transcoding and caching proxy for heterogenous e-commerce environments,Anuj Maheshwari; Aashish Sharma; Krithi Ramamritham; Prashant Shenoy,With the advent of the wireless Internet; the client space has become heterogeneous interms of device capabilities. To cater to the needs of these devices in e-commerceapplications; smart intermediaries have been developed to increase the user satisfaction byhiding the inherent weakness of some of the small although handy devices like the PDAsand Web-tops. Transcoding has been a popular technique to render data for small devicesthat have smaller displays; and lesser colour capabilities; but transcoding comes at the costof caching at the intermediary. We describe a transcoding and caching proxy that cachesobjects for heterogeneous client spaces by maintaining separate caches for differentcategories of clients (PC; PDAs; mobiles; etc.) and transcoding the lower fidelity; versionsfrom the high fidelity variants at the proxies as opposed to fetching the transcoded …,Research Issues in Data Engineering: Engineering E-Commerce/E-Business Systems; 2002.

Revisiting commit processing in distributed database systems,Ramesh Gupta; Jayant Haritsa; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract A significant body of literature is available on distributed transaction commitprotocols. Surprisingly; however; the relative merits of these protocols have not been studiedwith respect to their quantitative impact on transaction processing performance. In thispaper; using a detailed simulation model of a distributed database system; we profile thetransaction throughput performance of a representative set of commit protocols. A newcommit protocol; OPT; that allows transactions to “optimistically” borrow uncommitted data ina controlled manner is also proposed and evaluated. The new protocol is easy to implementand incorporate in current systems; and can coexist with most other optimizations proposedearlier. For example; OPT can be combined with current industry standard protocols such asPresumed Commit and Presumed Abort. The experimental results show that distributed …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,92
Priority assignment in real-time active databases,Rajendran M Sivasankaran; John A Stankovic; Don Towsley; Bhaskar Purimetla; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract. Active databases and real-time databases have been important areas of researchin the recent past. It has been recognized that many benefits can be gained by integratingreal-time and active database technologies. However; not much work has been done in thearea of transaction processing in real-time active databases. This paper deals with animportant aspect of transaction processing in real-time active databases; namely theproblem of assigning priorities to transactions. In these systems; time-constrainedtransactions trigger other transactions during their execution. We present three policies forassigning priorities to parent; immediate and deferred transactions executing on amultiprocessor system and then evaluate the policies through simulation. The policies usedifferent amounts of semantic information about transactions to assign the priorities. The …,The VLDB Journal,1996,90
Using Windows NT for real-time applications: Experimental observations and recommendations,Krithi Ramamritham; Chia Shen; Oscar González; Subhabrata Sen; Shreedhar Shirgurkar,Windows NT was not designed as a real time operating system; but market forces and theacceptance of NT in industrial applications have generated a need for achieving real timefunctionality with NT. As its use for real time applications proliferates; based on anexperimental evaluation of NT; we quantitatively characterize the obstacles placed by NT. Asa result of these observations; we provide a set of recommendations for users to considerwhile building real time applications on NT. These are validated by the use of NT for aprototype application involving real time control that includes multimedia informationprocessing. The results of the above study should provide system designers with guidelines;as well as insight; into the design of an architecture based on NT for supporting applicationswith components having real time constraints.,Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium; 1998.

Where do time constraints come from? Where do they go?,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract While a lot of work has been done in real-time systems; in real-time databasesystems; and more recently; in real-time active databases on the topic of time constrainedprocessing of tasks and transactions; very little work exists that deals with the origin of thetime constraints associated with the data; the events; and the actions. In this paper weidentify the sources and semantics of time constraints and show that it is important tominimize the number of “mandated” timing requirements and also weaken the implicationsof timing constraint violations. The Event-Condition-Action rules of active real-timedatabases provide a useful framework to specify the timing properties of interest as well asthe actions to be taken when the properties are violated. That is; an active real-timedatabase can be made to store the data pertaining to the controlled system as well as the …,Journal of Database Management (JDM),1996,89
Maintaining temporal coherency of virtual data warehouses,Raghav Srinivasan; Chao Liang; Krithi Ramamritham,In electronic commerce applications such as stock trading; there is a need to consult sourcesavailable on the web for informed decision making. Because information such as stockprices keep changing; the web sources must be queried continually to maintain temporalcoherency of the collected data; thereby avoiding decisions based on stale information.However because network infrastructure has failed to keep pace with ever growing webtraffic; the frequency of contacting web servers must be kept to a minimum. This paperpresents adaptive approaches for the maintenance of temporal coherency of data gatheredfrom web sources. Specifically; it introduces mechanisms to obtain timely updates from websources; based on the dynamics of the data and the users' need for temporal accuracy byjudiciously; combining push and pull technologies and by using virtual data warehouses …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1998.

Automating the detection of snapshot isolation anomalies,Sudhir Jorwekar; Alan Fekete; Krithi Ramamritham; S Sudarshan,Abstract Snapshot isolation (SI) provides significantly improved concurrency over 2PL;allowing reads to be non-blocking. Unfortunately; it can also lead to non-serializableexecutions in general. Despite this; it is widely used; supported in many commercialdatabases; and is in fact the highest available level of consistency in Oracle and Post-greSQL. Sufficient conditions for detecting whether SI anomalies could occur in a given setof transactions were presented recently; and extended to necessary conditions fortransactions without predicate reads. In this paper we address several issues in extendingthe earlier theory to practical detection/correction of anomalies. We first show how tomechanically find a set of programs which is large enough so that we ensure that allexecutions will be free of SI anomalies; by modifying these programs appropriately.

Scheduling transactions with temporal constraints: exploiting data semantics,Ming Xiong; Rajendran Sivasankaran; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley,In this paper; issues involved in the design of a real-time database which maintains datatemporal consistency are discussed. The concept of data-deadline is introduced and timecognizant non-waiting transaction scheduling policies are proposed. Further; two timecognizant forced wait policies which improve performance significantly by forcing atransaction to delay further execution until a new version of sensor data becomes availableare proposed. A way to exploit temporal data similarity to improve performance is alsoproposed. Finally; these policies are evaluated through detailed simulation experiments.The simulation results show that taking advantage of temporal data semantics in transactionscheduling can significantly improve the performance of user transactions in real-timedatabase systems. In particular; it is demonstrated that under the forced wait policy; the …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1996.; 17th IEEE,1996,82

Real-time concurrent C: A language for programming dynamic real-time systems,Narain Gehani; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Concurrent C; is a parallel superset of C (and of C++) that provides facilities such asspecifying timeouts during process interactions; delaying program execution; acceptingmessages in a user-specified order; and asynchronous messages that can be used forwriting real-time programs. However; Concurrent C does not provide facilities for specifyingstrict timing constraints; eg; Concurrent C only ensures that the lower bounds on thespecified delay and timeout periods are satisfied. Real-Time Concurrent C extendsConcurrent C by providing facilities to specify periodicity or deadline constraints; to seekguarantees that timing constraints will be met; and to perform alternative actions when eitherthe timing constraints cannot be met or the guarantees are not available.

Consistency maintenance in peer-to-peer file sharing networks,Jiang Lan; Xiaotao Liu; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham,While the current generation of peer-to-peer networks share predominantly static files; futurepeer-to-peer networks will support sharing of files that are modified frequently by their users.We present techniques to maintain temporal consistency of replicated files in a peer-to-peernetwork. We consider the Gnutella P2P network and present techniques for maintainingconsistency in Gnutella even when peers containing replicated files dynamically join andleave the network. An experimental evaluation of our techniques shows that:(i) a hybridapproach based on push and pull achieves high fidelity in highly dynamic P2P networks and(ii) the run-time overheads of our techniques are small; making them a practical choice forP2P networks.,Internet Applications.

A new approach for scheduling of parallelizable tasks in real-time multiprocessor systems,G Manimaran; C Siva Ram Murthy; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In a parallelizable task model; a task can be parallelized and the component taskscan be executed concurrently on multiple processors. We use this parallelism in tasks tomeet their deadlines and also obtain better processor utilisation compared to non-parallelized tasks. Non-preemptive parallelizable task scheduling combines the advantagesof higher schedulability and lower scheduling overhead offered by the preemptive and non-preemptive task scheduling models; respectively. We propose a new approach to maximizethe benefits from task parallelization. It involves checking the schedulability of periodic tasks(if necessary; by parallelizing them) off-line and run-time scheduling of the schedulableperiodic tasks together with dynamically arriving aperiodic tasks. To avoid the run-timeanomaly that may occur when the actual computation time of a task is less than its worst …,Real-Time Systems,1998,78
Monitoring the dynamic web to respond to continuous queries,Sandeep Pandey; Krithi Ramamritham; Soumen Chakrabarti,Abstract Continuous queries are queries for which responses given to users must becontinuously updated; as the sources of interest get updated. Such queries occur; forinstance; during on-line decision making; eg; traffic flow control; weather monitoring; etc. Theproblem of keeping the responses current reduces to the problem of deciding how often tovisit a source to determine if and how it has been modified; in order to update earlierresponses accordingly. On the surface; this seems to be similar to the crawling problemsince crawlers attempt to keep indexes up-to-date as pages change and users pose searchqueries. We show that this is not the case; both due to the inherent differences between thenature of the two problems as well as the performance metric.

Enabling scalable online personalization on the Web,Debra VanderMeer; Kaushik Dutta; Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamritham; Shamkant B Navanthe,ABSTRACT Online personalization is of great interest to e-companies. Virtually allpersonalization technologies are based on the idea of storing as much historical customersession data as possible; and then querying the data store as customers navigate through aweb site. The holy grail of on-line personalization is an environment where fine-grained;detailed historical session data can be queried based on current online navigation patternsfor use in formulating real-time responses. Unfortunately; as more consumers become e-shoppers; the user load and the amount of historical data continue to increase; causingscalability-related problems for almost all current personalization technologies.

Cooperative leases: Scalable consistency maintenance in content distribution networks,Anoop Ninan; Purushottam Kulkarni; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham; Renu Tewari,Abstract In this paper; we argue that cache consistency mechanisms designed for stand-alone proxies do not scale to the large number of proxies in a content distribution networkand are not flexible enough to allow consistency guarantees to be tailored to object needs.To meet the twin challenges of scalability and flexibility; we introduce the notion ofcooperative consistency along with a mechanism; called cooperative leases; to achieve it.By supporting &Dgr;-consistency semantics and by using a single lease for multiple proxies;cooperative leases allows the notion of leases to be applied in a flexible; scalable manner toCDNs. Further; the approach employs application-level multicast to propagate servernotifications to proxies in a scalable manner.

Maintaining coherency of dynamic data in cooperating repositories,Shetal Shah; Krithi Ramaritham; Prashant Shenoy,This chapter considers techniques for disseminating dynamic data; such as stock prices andreal-time weather information from sources to a set of repositories. Online decision makingoften involves significant amount of time-varying data. Examples of such data includefinancial information such as stock prices and currency exchange rates; real-time traffic andweather information; and data from sensors in industrial process control applications. Theseoften occur in the form of data streams. Due to their time-varying nature; users accessingsuch data items need to be provided with up-to-date values of these items. The coherencyrequirements associated with a time-varying data item depend on the nature of the item anduser tolerances. To illustrate; a user involved in exploiting exchange disparities in differentmarkets or an online stock trader may impose stringent coherency requirements (for …,*,2002,73
A comparative study of alternative middle tier caching solutions to support dynamic web content acceleration,Anindya Datta; Kaushik Dutta; Helen M Thomas; Debra E VanderMeer; Krithi Ramamritham; Dan Fishman,E-business sites are increasingly utilizing dynamic web pages since they enable a muchwider range of interaction than static HTML pages can provide.

Synchronizing transactions on objects,BR Badrinath; Krithi Ramamritham,A method is discussed for synchronizing operations on objects when the operations areinvoked by transactions. The technique; which is motivated by a desire to make use ofpossible concurrency in accessing objects; takes into consideration the granularity at whichoperations affect an object. A dynamic method is presented for determining the compatibilityof an invoked operation with respect to operations in progress. In making decisions; itutilizes the state of the object; the semantics of the uncommitted operations; the actualparameters of the invoked operation; and the effect of the operations on the objects. One ofthe attractive features of this technique is that a single framework can be used to deal withthe problem of synchronizing access to simple objects as well as compound objects; ieobjects in which some components are themselves objects.,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1988,71

Adaptive fault tolerance and graceful degradation under dynamic hard real-time scheduling,Oscar González; H Shrikumar; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,Static redundancy allocation is inappropriate in hard real-time systems that operate invariable and dynamic environments;(eg; radar tracking; avionics). Adaptive fault tolerance(AFT) can assure adequate reliability of critical modules; under temporal and resourceconstraints; by allocating just as much redundancy to less critical modules as can beafforded thus gracefully reducing their resource requirement. We propose a mechanism forsupporting adaptive fault tolerance in a real-time system. Adaptation is achieved bychoosing a suitable redundancy strategy for a dynamically arriving computation to assurerequired reliability and to maximize the potential for fault tolerance while ensuring thatdeadlines are met. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-life workloadsimulating radar tracking software in AWACS early warning aircraft. The results …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1997.

MIRROR: A state-conscious concurrency control protocol for replicated real-time databases,Ming Xiong; Krithi Ramamritham; Jayant R Haritsa; John A Stankovic,Abstract Data replication can help database systems meet the stringent temporal constraintsof current real-time applications; especially Web-based directory and electronic commerceservices. A prerequisite for realizing the benefits of replication; however; is the developmentof high-performance concurrency control mechanisms. In this paper; we present managingisolation in replicated real-time object repositories (MIRROR); a concurrency control protocolspecifically designed for firm-deadline applications operating on replicated real-timedatabases. MIRROR augments the classical O2PL concurrency control protocol with a novelstate-based real-time conflict resolution mechanism. In this scheme; the choice of conflictresolution method is a dynamic function of the states of the distributed transactions involvedin the conflict. A feature of the design is that acquiring the state knowledge does not …,Information systems,2002,69
Scheduling communication in real-time sensor applications,Huan Li; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham,We consider a class of wireless sensor applications-such as mobile robotics-that imposetimeliness constraints. We assume that these applications are built using commodity 802.11wireless networks and focus on the problem of providing qualitatively-better QoS duringnetwork transmission of sensor data. Our techniques are designed to explicitly avoidnetwork collisions and minimize the completion time to transmit a set of sensor messages.We argue that this problem is NP-complete and present three heuristics; based on edgecoloring; to achieve these goals. Our simulations results show that the minimum weight colorheuristic is robust to increases in communication density and yields results that are close tothe optimal solution.,Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium; 2004.

Ace in the hole: Adaptive contour estimation using collaborating mobile sensors,Sumana Srinivasan; Krithi Ramamritham; Purushottam Kulkarni,This paper focuses on the use of mobile sensors to estimate contours in a field. In particular;we focus onstrategies to estimate the contour with minimum latency and maximum precision.We propose a novel algorithm; ACE (Adaptive Contour Estimation); that (a) estimates andexploits information regarding the gradients in the field to move towards the contour and (b)uses a spread component to surround the contour in order to optimize latency. While it ispossible for sensors to spread as they approach the contour; it is crucial to judiciouslydetermine when and how much to spread. Spreading too early or too much may result inincreasing the latency or affecting the precision.

Real-time transaction processing: design; implementation; and performance evaluation,Jiandong Huang; J Stankovic; D Towsley; K Ramamritham,Abstract In addition to satisfying database consistency requirements; as in traditionaldatabase systems; real-time transaction processing systems must also satisfy timingconstraints. To support real-time transaction processing; some new criteria and issuesshould be considered in design and implementation of real-time database systems. In thispaper; we design algorithms for handling CPU scheduling; data conﬂict resolution; deadlockresolution; transaction wakeup; and transaction restart; based on a locking scheme forconcurrency control.

Interestingness and Pruning of Mined Patterns.,Devavrat Shah; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Krithi Ramamritham; S Sudarshan,Abstract We study the following question: when can a mined pattern; which may be anassociation; a correlation; ratio rule; or any other; be regarded as interesting? Previousapproaches to answering this question have been largely numeric. Speci cally; we show thatthe presence of some rules may make others redundant; and therefore uninteresting. Wearticulate these principles and formalize them in the form of pruning rules. Pruning rules;when applied to a collection of mined patterns; can be used to eliminate redundant ones. Asa concrete instance; we applied our pruning rules on association rules/positive associationrules derived from a census database; and demonstrate that signi cant pruning results.,1999 ACM SIGMOD workshop on research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,1999,63
In search of acceptability criteria: Database consistency requirements and transaction correctness properties,Krithi Ramamritham; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Whereas serializability captures database consistency requirements andtransaction correctness properties via a single notion; recent research has attempted tocome up with correctness criteria that view these two types of requirements indepen-dently.The search for more flexible correctness criteria is partly motivated by the introduction of newtransaction models that extend the traditional atomic transaction model. These extensionscame about because the atomic transac-tion model in conjunction with serializability isfound to be very constraining when applied in advanced applications; such as; designdatabases; that function in distributed; cooperative; and heterogeneous environments.

See what's enBlogue: real-time emergent topic identification in social media,Foteini Alvanaki; Sebastian Michel; Krithi Ramamritham; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract With the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 streams; people become overwhelmed bythe available information. This is partly countered by tagging blog posts and tweets; so thatusers can filter messages according to their tags. However; this is insufficient for detectingnewly emerging topics that are not reflected by a single tag but are rather expressed byunusual tag combinations. This paper presents enBlogue; an approach for automaticallydetecting such emergent topics. EnBlogue uses a time-sliding window to compute statisticsabout tags and tag-pairs. These statistics are then used to identify unusual shifts incorrelations; most of the time caused by real-world events. We analyze the strength of theseshifts and measure the degree of unpredictability they include; used to rank tag-pairsexpressing emergent topics.

Maintaining Temporal Consistency: Issues and Algorithms.,Ming Xiong; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Donald F Towsley; Rajendran M Sivasankaran,Abstract Although transaction scheduling and concurrency control issues that arise in real-time databases have been studied in detail; insufficient attention has been paid to issuesthat arise when real-time transactions access data with temporal validity. Such transactionsmust not only meet their deadlines but also read and use data that correctly reflects theenvironment. In this paper; we discuss the issues involved in the design of a real-time activedatabase which maintains data temporal consistency. The concept of data-deadline isintroduced and time cognizant transaction scheduling algorithms which exploit thesemantics of data and transactions based on data-deadline are proposed.,RTDB,1996,62
Performance evaluation of semantics-based multilevel concurrency control protocols,BR Badrinath; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract For next generation information systems; concurrency control mechanisms arerequired to handle high level abstract operations and to meet high throughput demands. Thecurrently available single level concurrency control mechanisms for reads and writes areinadequate for future complex information systems. In this paper; we will present a newmultilevel concurrency protocol that uses a semantics-based notion of conflict; which isweaker than commutativity; called recoverability.

It considers techniques for creating a resilient and efficient contentdistribution network for such dynamically changing streaming data. The chapter addressesthe problem of maintaining the coherency of dynamic data items in a network of repositories:Data disseminated to one repository is filtered by that repository and disseminated torepositories dependent on it. The method is resilient to link failures and repository failures.This resiliency implies that data fidelity is not lost even when the repository from which auser obtains data experiences failures.

Maintaining mutual consistency for cached web objects,Bhuvan Urgaonkar; Anoop George Ninan; Mohammad S Raunak; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham,Existing Web proxy caches employ cache consistency mechanisms to ensure that locallycached data is consistent with that at the server. We argue that techniques for maintainingconsistency of individual objects are not sufficient; a proxy should employ additionalmechanisms to ensure that related Web objects are mutually consistent with one another.We formally define the notion of mutual consistency and the semantics provided by a mutualconsistency mechanism to end users. We then present techniques for maintaining mutualconsistency in the temporal and value domains. A novel aspect of our techniques is that theycan adapt to the variations in the rate of change of the source data; resulting in judicious useof proxy and network resources.

Existing techniques for discovering suchevents from a microblog stream in real time (such as Twitter trending topics); have severallacunae when used for discovering emerging events; extant graph based event detectiontechniques are not practical in microblog settings due to their complexity; and conventionaltechniques; which have been developed for blogs; web-pages; etc.; involving the use ofkeyword search; are only useful for finding information about known events.

Two main challenges of the boundary tracking problemare accurate boundary estimation from noisy observations and continuous tracking of theboundary. We propose Dynamic Boundary Tracking (DBTR); an algorithm that combines thespatial estimation and temporal estimation techniques. The regression-based spatialestimation technique determines discrete points on the boundary and estimates aconfidence band around the entire boundary. In addition; a Kalman Filter-based temporalestimation technique tracks changes in the boundary and aperiodically updates the spatialestimate to meet accuracy requirements.

Static scheduling of pipelined periodic tasks in distributed real-time systems,Gerhard Fohler; Krithi Ramamritham,Many distributed real time applications involve periodic activities with end to end timingconstraints that are larger than the periods. That is; a new instance of a periodic activity willcome into existence before the previous instance has been completed. Also; such activitiestypically involve communicating modules in a distributed system where some modules maybe replicated for resilience. For such activities; pipelined execution allows us to meet thevarious resource and timing constraints imposed on them. We discuss an approach todealing with the pipelined execution of a set of periodic activities that have the abovecharacteristics. It can be called a meta algorithm since it works in conjunction with anotherscheduling algorithm-one that creases the actual schedules.

The holy grail of online personalization is an environment where fine-grained;detailed historical session data can be queried based on current online navigation patternsfor use in formulating real-time responses.

Experimental evaluations showed the new OPT protocol to behighly successful; as compared to the classical distributed commit protocols; in minimizingthe number of missed transaction deadlines.

While someof the limitations are due to the process-centric approach adopted by WFMS developers;others are due to the lack of support for emerging technologies like mobile computing. Thelimitations are in the form of inadequacies in modeling and/or execution support.

Issues in the static allocation and scheduling of complex periodic tasks,Krithi Ramamritham; Gerhard Fohler; Juan Manuel Adan,Resources needed to meet the deadlines of safety-critical tasks are typically preallocated.Also; these tasks are usually statically scheduled such that their deadlines will be met evenunder worst-case conditions. Besides periodicity constraints; algorithms that do allocationand scheduling must be able to handle the resource; precedence; communication; and faulttolerance constraints associated with the subtasks of the tasks. In 6]; an allocation andscheduling algorithm was presented for dealing with these tasks. It assumed a set of taskswhose deadlines were less than their periods and assumed that only safety-critical periodictasks were present. Our recent work extends the applicability of static algorithms such asthis; when these assumptions are removed. This extended abstract discusses the salientaspects of the resulting approach.

Resource reclaiming in real time,Chia Shen; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Resource reclaiming refers to the problem of utilizing the resources left unused by a taskwhen it executes in less than its worst-case computation time; or when a task is deleted fromthe current schedule. In dynamic real-time multiprocessor environments; resourcereclaiming can be used to improve the average performance. Dynamic resource reclaimingalgorithms must be effective in reclaiming unused time and also avoiding any anomalies.The authors present resource reclaiming algorithms with these properties. These algorithmsare designed to have time complexity independent of the number of tasks in a schedule. Theeffectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated through simulation studies. The algorithmshave also been implemented in the Spring Kernel.,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1990. Proceedings.; 11th,1990,40

Channel characteristics in local-area hard real-time systems,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In many distributed hard real-time systems; ie; systems in which tasks havedeadlines; it is essential that messages between nodes be delivered in a timely manner. Ifthe nodes are connected by a local area network; the channel access protocol shouldprovide for message delivery within bounded time. Real-time systems can then be designedassuming bounded message delivery delays. Recently a number of protocols have beenproposed for bounding channel access delays. But the bound mainly applies to themessage that is in front of a node's queue of messages waiting to be transmitted. This paperconcerns the computation of maximum channel access delay for any message generated bya node. This computation utilizes one of the above mentioned protocols.

On earliest deadline first scheduling for temporal consistency maintenance,Ming Xiong; Qiong Wang; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract A real-time object is one whose state may become invalid with the passage of time.A temporal validity interval is associated with the object state; and the real-time object istemporally consistent if its temporal validity interval has not expired. Clearly; the problem ofmaintaining temporal consistency of data is motivated by the need for a real-time system totrack its environment correctly. Hence; sensor transactions must be able to executeperiodically and also each instance of a transaction should perform the relevant data updatebefore its deadline. Unfortunately; the period and deadline assignment problem for periodicsensor transactions has not received the attention that it deserves. An exception is the More-Less scheme; which uses the Deadline Monotonic (DM) algorithm for scheduling periodicsensor transactions. However; there is no work addressing this problem from the …,Real-Time Systems,2008,38
Implementation of a real-time database system,Rohan FM Aranha; Venkatesh Ganti; Srinivasa Narayanan; CR Muthukrishnan; STS Prasad; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract A real-time database system is a database system in which transactions haveexplicit timing constraints such as deadlines. Apart from satisfying the database consistencyconstraints; transaction executions must also satisfy these timing constraints. The goal oftransaction and query processing in real-time databases is to maximise the number ofsuccessful transactions in the system.

Scheduling in real-time transaction systems,John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley,Abstract In many application areas database management systems may have to operateunder real-time constraints. We have taken an integrated approach to developing algorithmsfor cpu scheduling; con-currency control (based both on locking and on optimisticconcurrency control); conflict resolution; transaction restart; transaction wakeup; deadlock;buffer management; and disk I/O scheduling. In all cases the algorithms directly address real-time constraints. We have developed new algorithms; implemented them on anexperimental testbed called RT-CARAT; and evaluated their performance. We have paidparticular note to how the algorithms interact with each other and to actual implementationcosts and their impact on performance. The experimental results are numerous andconstitute the first such results on an actual real-time database testbed. The main …,*,1991,38
Curio: A novel solution for efficient storage and indexing in data warehouses,Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamritham; Helen Thomas,Abstract Efficient query processing is a critical requirement for data warehousing systems asdecision support applications often require interactive response times to answer complex;ad-hoc queries (eg; aggregations; multi-way joins) over vast repositories of data (eg;hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size). The most common approach used to improve On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) query performance is to utilize indexes or accessstructures to quickly access the base data. A major drawback to this approach is that it oftenincurs significant overhead as the access structures must be stored in addition to the basedata. In this paper; we present Curio; a data repository and OLAP query server; whichprovides drastically improved performance for ad-hoc queries; while simultaneouslyreducing the storage costs associated with warehousing.

Scheduling strategies adopted in spring: An overview,Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Abstract In managing the tasks and resources in a real-time system; there are three phasesto consider: allocation-the assignment of the tasks and resources to the appropriate nodesor processors in the system scheduling-ordering the execution of tasks such that their timingconstraints are met and the consistency of resources is maintained; and dispatching-executing the tasks in conformance with the scheduler's decisions. Whereas a large part ofour work deals with scheduling; more recently we have begun to examine allocation anddispatching issues in the context of our scheduling approach. To date; the main results ofour work include (i) the adoption and development of guarantee; a notion fundamental topredictable scheduling;(ii) algorithms for the guarantee of dynamically arriving tasks;(iii) ananalysis of the quality of the schedules produced by the basic version of our algorithm;(iv) …,*,1991,36
Performance characteristics of epsilon serializability with hierarchical inconsistency bounds,Mohan Kamath; Krithi Ramamritham,The notion of hierarchical inconsistency bounds that allows inconsistency to be specified atdifferent granularities-with transactions being at the top of the hierarchy; objects at thebottom; and groups in between-is introduced. The mechanisms needed to control theinconsistency so that it lies within the specified bounds are described. The performanceimprovement due to epsilon serializability (ESR) is evaluated. Two important observationsare made. First; the thrashing point shifts to a higher multiprogramming level whentransaction inconsistency bounds are increased. Second; for a particular multiprogramminglevel and a particular transaction inconsistency bound; the throughput does not increasewith increasing object inconsistency bounds but peaks at some intermediate value.,Data Engineering; 1993.

Consistency maintenance in dynamic peer-to-peer overlay networks,Xiaotao Liu; Jiang Lan; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramaritham,Abstract In this paper; we present techniques to maintain temporal consistency of replicatedobjects in data-centric peer-to-peer overlay applications. We consider both structured andunstructured overlay networks; represented by Chord and Gnutella; respectively; andpresent techniques for maintaining consistency of replicated data objects in the presence ofdynamic joins and leaves. We present extensions to the Chord and Gnutella protocol toincorporate our consistency techniques and implement our extensions to Gnutella into a Gtk-Gnutella prototype. An experimental evaluation of our techniques shows that:(i) a push-based approach achieves near-perfect fidelity in a stable overlay network;(ii) a hybridapproach based on push and pull achieves high fidelity in highly dynamic overlay networksand (iii) the run-time overheads of our techniques are small; making them a practical …,Computer Networks,2006,34
Executing incoherency bounded continuous queries at web data aggregators,Rajeev Gupta; Ashish Puri; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Continuous queries are used to monitor changes to time varying data and toprovide results useful for online decision making. Typically a user desires to obtain the valueof some function over distributed data items; for example; to determine when and whether(a) the traffic entering a highway from multiple feed roads will result in congestion in athoroughfare or (b) the value of a stock portfolio exceeds a threshold. Using the standardWeb infrastructure for these applications will increase the reach of the underlyinginformation. But; since these queries involve data from multiple sources; with sourcessupporting standard HTTP (pull-based) interfaces; special query processing techniques areneeded. Also; these applications often have the flexibility to tolerate some incoherency; ie;some differences between the results reported to the user and that produced from the …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,34
Parallel star join+ dataindexes: Efficient query processing in data warehouses and olap,Anindya Datta; Debra VanderMeer; Krithi Ramamritham,On-line analytical processing (OLAP) refers to the technologies that allow users to efficientlyretrieve data from the data warehouse for decision-support purposes. Data warehouses tendto be extremely large; it is quite possible for a data warehouse to be hundreds of gigabytesto terabytes in size (Chauduri and Dayal; 1997). Queries tend to be complex and ad hoc;often requiring computationally expensive operations such as joins and aggregation. Giventhis; we are interested in developing strategies for improving query processing in datawarehouses by exploring the applicability of parallel processing techniques. In particular; weexploit the natural partitionability of a star schema and render it even more efficient byapplying DataIndexes-a storage structure that serves both as an index as well as data andlends itself naturally to vertical partitioning of the data. DataIndexes are derived from the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,34
Priority assignment in real-time active databases,Bhaskar Purimetla; Rajendran M Sivasankaran; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley,Active databases and real-time databases have been important areas of research in therecent past. It has been recognized that many benefits can be gained by integrating activeand real-time database technologies. However; there has not been much work done in thearea of transaction processing in active real-time databases. This paper deals with animportant aspect of transaction processing in active real-time databases; namely theproblem of assigning priorities to transactions. In these systems; time-constrainedtransactions trigger other transactions during their execution. We present various policies forassigning priorities to parent; immediate and deferred transactions executing on amultiprocessor system and then evaluate the policies using simulation. The simulator hasbeen validated by comparing to three sets of published results.

A study of distributed real-time active database applications,Bhaskar Purimetla; Rajendran M Sivasankaran; John A Stankovic; K Ramamritham; D Towsley,Real-time database systems has been an active research area in recent times. In spite ofthis; their applicability to speci c applications has not been well studied. We attempt to rectifythis shortcoming by studying two applications: 1) cooperative distributed navigation systemsand 2) network services database systems. The former is a hard real-time system and thelatter a soft/rm real-time system. Cooperative distributed navigation systems appear inseveral complex applications such as road following and robot navigation. These systemsusually consist of multiple sensor-based agents which work in a distributed and cooperativefashion towards a common goal. These agents are guided by a high level controller whichfacilitates coordination and cooperation among the agents.

Asynchronous in-network prediction: Efficient aggregation in sensor networks,Pavan Edara; Ashwin Limaye; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Given a sensor network and aggregate queries over the values sensed by subsetsof nodes in the network; how do we ensure that high quality results are served for themaximum possible time&quest; The issues underlying this question relate to the fidelity ofquery results and lifetime of the network. To maximize both; we propose a novel techniquecalled asynchronous in-network prediction incorporating two computationally efficientmethods for in-network prediction of partial aggregate values. These values are propagatedvia a tree whose construction is cognizant of (a) the coherency requirements associated withthe queries;(b) the remaining energy at the sensors; and (c) the communication andmessage processing delays. Finally; we exploit in-network filtering and in-networkaggregation to reduce the energy consumption of the nodes in the network. Experimental …,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN),2008,32

Merge algorithms for intelligent vehicles,Gurulingesh Raravi; Vipul Shingde; Krithi Ramamritham; Jatin Bharadia,There is an increased concern towards the design and development of computer-controlledautomotive applications to improve safety; reduce accidents; increase traffic flow; andenhance comfort for drivers. Automakers are trying to make vehicles more intelligent byembedding processors which can be used to implement Electronic and Control Software(ECS) for taking smart decisions on the road or assisting the driver in doing the same. TheseECS applications are high-integrity; distributed and real-time in nature. Inter-VehicleCommunication and Road-Vehicle Communication (IVC/RVC) mechanisms will only add tothis intelligence by enabling distributed implementation of these applications.

Optimized query planning of continuous aggregation queries in dynamic data dissemination networks,Rajeev Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Continuous queries are used to monitor changes to time varying data and toprovide results useful for online decision making. Typically a user desires to obtain the valueof some aggregation function over distributed data items; for example; to know (a) theaverage of temperatures sensed by a set of sensors (b) the value of index of mid-cap stocks.In these queries a client specifies a coherency requirement as part of the query. In this paperwe present a low-cost; scalable technique to answer continuous aggregation queries usinga content distribution network of dynamic data items. In such a network of data aggregators;each data aggregator serves a set of data items at specific coherencies. Just as variousfragments of a dynamic web-page are served by one or more nodes of a content distributionnetwork; our technique involves decomposing a client query into sub-queries and …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,30
Efficient data management on lightweight computing devices,Rajkumar Sen; Krithi Ramamritham,Lightweight computing devices are becoming ubiquitous and an increasing number ofapplications are being developed for these devices. Many of these applications deal withsignificant amounts of data and involve complex joins and aggregate operations; whichnecessitate a local database management system on the device. This is a challenge asthese devices are constrained by limited stable storage and main memory. Hence newstorage models that reduce storage costs are needed and a storage scheme should beselected based on data characteristics; nature of queries; and updates. Also; queryexecution plan should be chosen depending on the amount of available memory and theunderlying storage scheme; memory should be optimally allocated among the databaseoperators involved in the query. To achieve these goals; we utilize a novel storage model …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,30
New algorithms for resource reclaiming from precedence constrained tasks in multiprocessor real-time systems,G Manimaran; C Siva Ram Murthy; Machiraju Vijay; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The scheduling of tasks in multiprocessor real-time systems has attracted manyresearchers in the recent past. Tasks in these systems have deadlines to be met; and mostof the real-time scheduling algorithms use worst case computation times to schedule thesetasks. Many resources will be left unused if the tasks are dispatched purely based on theschedule produced by these scheduling algorithms; since most of the tasks will take lesstime to execute than their respective worst case computation times. Resource reclaimingrefers to the problem of reclaiming the resources left unused by a real-time task when ittakes less time to execute than its worst case computation time. In this paper; we proposetwo algorithms to reclaim these resources from real-time tasks that are constrained byprecedence relations and resource requirements; in shared memory multiprocessor …,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,1997,30
Adaptive fault-tolerance with statically scheduled real-time systems,Gerhard Fohler,Safety critical real-time systems need to complement their methods for meeting timingconstraints with fault tolerance for real-world applications. While scheduling algorithms toprovide fixed reliability levels have been introduced; methods to enable a real-time systemto adapt to changing reliability requirements at run-time have been given little attention. Theauthor presents an approach for adaptive fault tolerance with statically scheduled real-timesystems. The idea is to provide a minimum reliability level by constructing a static schedule.At run-time; he uses a method to integrate static and dynamic scheduling; slot shifting. It isused to incorporate a variety of fault tolerance activities into the static schedule dynamicallywithout impairing the feasibility of the pre-guaranteed tasks and minimum reliabilityactivities.

Buffer Management For Continuous Media Sharing In Multimedia Databse Systems,Mohan Kamath; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley,Abstract Buffer management in database systems deals with allocation; search andreplacement of buffers for the data to be accessed so as to promote data sharing and reducethe number of disk accesses. These activities are much more complex in multimediadatabase systems (MMDBS) which handle time variant data. Mul-timedia data havetimeliness and synchronization requirements and hence traditional buffer managementschemes like FIFO and LRU are not quite suitable for multimedia buffer management. Sincethe data rates involved are very high; despite the development of ef-ficient storage andretrieval strategies; disk I/O is likely to be a bottleneck; thereby limiting the number ofconcurrent ses-sions supported by a system.

Scalable consistency maintenance in content distribution networks using cooperative leases,Anoop George Ninan; Purushottam Kulkarni; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham; Renu Tewari,We argue that cache consistency mechanisms designed for stand-alone proxies do notscale to the large number of proxies in a content distribution network and are not flexibleenough to allow consistency guarantees to be tailored to object needs. To meet the twinchallenges of scalability and flexibility; we introduce the notion of cooperative consistencyalong with a mechanism; called cooperative leases; to achieve it. By supporting/spl Delta/-consistency semantics and by using a single lease for multiple proxies; cooperative leasesallow the notion of leases to be applied in a flexible; scalable manner to CDNs. Further; theapproach employs application-level multicast to propagate server notifications to proxies ina scalable manner.

Middleware versus native os support: Architectural considerations for supporting multimedia applications,Prashant Shenoy; Saif Hasan; Purushottam Kulkarni; Krithi Ramamritham,In this paper; we examine two architectural alternatives-native OS support versusmiddleware-for supporting multimedia applications. Specifically; we examine whetherextensions to OS functionality are necessary for supporting multimedia applications; orwhether much of these benefits can be accrued by implementing resource managementmechanisms in a middleware system. To answer these questions; we use QLinux and TAOas representative examples of a multimedia operating system and a multimedia middleware;respectively; and examine their effectiveness in supporting distributed applications. Ourresults show that although the run-time overheads of a middleware can impact applicationperformance; middleware resource management mechanisms can; nevertheless; be aseffective as native OS mechanisms for many applications.

Scheduling access to temporal data in real-time databases,Ming Xiong; Rajendran Sivasankaran; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham; Don Towsley,Abstract A real-time database system is a transaction processing system designed to handleworkloads in which transactions have deadlines. However; many realworld applicationsinvolve not only transactions with time constraints; but also data with time constraints. Suchdata; typically obtained from sensors; become inaccurate with the passage of time.Examples of such applications include autopilot systems; robot navigation; and programstock trading [14]. While considerable work has been done on real-time databases; most of itassumes that only transactions have deadlines [1; 7]. New solutions that consider data timeconstraints are required for both concurrency control and cpu scheduling. In this chapter;new solutions are presented based on data-deadlines and time cognizant forced waitpolicies. Informally; data-deadline can be viewed as the deadline that a transaction …,*,1997,28

The latter is especially important since intelligentautomotive applications deal with critical data and involve deadline bound computations ondata gathered from the automobiles' environment. These applications have stringentrequirements on the freshness of data items and completion time of the tasks.

Scalability and schedulability in large; coordinated; distributed robot systems,John D Sweeney; Huan Li; Roderic A Grupen; Krithi Ramamritham,Multiple; independent robot platforms promise significant advantage with respect torobustness and flexibility. However; coordination between otherwise independent robotsrequires the exchange of information; either implicitly (as in gestural communication); orexplicitly (as in message passing in a communication network.) In either case; controlprocesses resident on all coordinated peers must participate in the collective behavior. Thispaper evaluates the potential to scale such a coupled control framework to manyparticipating individuals; where scalability is evaluated in terms of the schedulability ofcoupled; distributed control processes.

Implications of proxy caching for provisioning networks and servers,Mohammad S Raunak; Prashant Shenoy; Pawan Goyal; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In this paper; we examine the potential benefits of web proxy caches in improvingthe effective capacity of servers and networks. Since networks and servers are typicallyprovisioned based on a high percentile of the load; we focus on the effects of proxy cachingon the tail of the load distribution. We find that; unlike their substantial impact on the averageload; proxies have a diminished impact on the tail of the load distribution. The exactreduction in the tail and the corresponding capacity savings depend on the percentile of theload distribution chosen for provisioning networks and servers—the higher the percentile;the smaller the savings. In particular; compared to over a 50% reduction in the average load;the savings in network and server capacity is only 20-35% for the 99 th percentile of the loaddistribution.

A Two-Phase Approach to Predictably Scheduling Real-Time Transactions.,Patrick E O'Neil; Krithi Ramamritham; Calton Pu,Abstract We consider the problem of designing a database system that schedules ACIDtransactions to meet real-time deadlines. Two complementary algorithms are proposed;valid for a large class of applications; that minimize the unproductive data contention andlimit to one the number of transaction aborts and subsequent retries arising from achievingserializability in concurrent execution. This is a crucial step in providing predictabletransaction scheduling capability for real-time needs. Both algorithms proposed envision twophases of transaction execution; a first phase that gathers needed information to make thetransaction predictable; and a second phase where transactions are scheduled forexecution so as to avoid data and resource contention.

Don't trash your intermediate results; cache'em,Prasan Roy; Krithi Ramamritham; S Seshadri; Pradeep Shenoy; S Sudarshan,Abstract: In data warehouse and data mart systems; queries often take a long time toexecute due to their complex nature. Query response times can be greatly improved bycaching final/intermediate results of previous queries; and using them to answer laterqueries. In this paper we describe a caching system called Exchequer which incorporatesseveral novel features including optimization aware cache maintenance and the use of acache aware optimizer. In contrast; in existing work; the module that makes cost-benefitdecisions is part of the cache manager and works independent of the optimizer whichessentially reconsiders these decisions while finding the best plan for a query. In our work;the optimizer takes the decisions for the cache manager. Furthermore; existing approachesare either restricted to cube (slice/point) queries; or cache just the query results.

Delegation: Efficiently rewriting history,Cris Pedregal Martin; Krithi Ramamritham,Transaction delegation; as introduced in ACTA; allows a transaction to transfer responsibilityfor the operations that it has performed on an object to another transaction. Delegation canbe used to broaden the visibility of the delegatee; and to tailor the recovery properties of atransaction model. Delegation has been shown to be useful in synthesizing advancedtransaction models. With an efficient implementation of delegation it becomes practicable torealize various advanced transaction models whose requirements are specified at a highlevel language instead of the current expensive practice of building them from scratch.

This paper is concerned with the application oftemporal logic to the specification of factors affecting the synchronization of concurrentprocesses. Towards this end; we first introduce a model for synchronization and axiomatizeits behavior. SYSL; a very high-level language for specifying synchronization properties; isthen described. It is designed using the primitives of temporal logic and features constructsto express properties that affect synchronization in a fairly natural and modular fashion.Since the statements in the language have intuitive interpretations; specifications arehumanly readable. In addition; since they possess appropriate formal semantics;unambiguous specifications result.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1983,25

We also discuss practical implementation-oriented issues that arisewhen real-time databases are married to temporal databases.

A real-time system description language,Douglas Niehaus; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,Building complex real-time systems requires languages and tools that permit carefulspecification of the system design as well as providing automatic calculation and analysis. Ifthis design and analysis environment is well done; it should be able to accommodatemodification of the system design through simple specification changes and then rerunningthe analysis tools. A critical aspect of such an environment is simultaneous support forconflicting goals: design by layered abstractions which conceal implementation details; andaccounting for those implementation details which are necessary to ascertain timingcorrectness. In this paper; we discuss the implementation of a system description language(SDL) that is part of an environment developed to address these problems.

SpringNet: A scalable architecture for high performance; predictable; and distributed real-time computing,John A Stankovic; Douglas Niehaus; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Many next generation; critical; hard real—time systems will require greaterﬂexibility; dependability; and predictability than is commonly found in today's systems. Thesefuture systems include the space station; integrated vision/robotics/AI systems; collections ofhumans/robots coordinating to achieve common objectives (usually in hazardous en-vironments such as undersea exploration or chemical plants); and various command andcontrol applications. Such real-time applications also have demanding executionrequirements requiring high performance computing. Our research approach challengesseveral basic assumptions upon which most current real—time systems are built andsubsequently advocates a new paradigm based on the notion of predictability and on amethod for on—line dynamic guarantee of certain types of deadlines.

Query planning for continuous aggregation queries over a network of data aggregators,Rajeev Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham,Continuous queries are used to monitor changes to time varying data and to provide resultsuseful for online decision making. Typically a user desires to obtain the value of someaggregation function over distributed data items; for example; to know value of portfolio for aclient; or the AVG of temperatures sensed by a set of sensors. In these queries a clientspecifies a coherency requirement as part of the query. We present a low-cost; scalabletechnique to answer continuous aggregation queries using a network of aggregators ofdynamic data items. In such a network of data aggregators; each data aggregator serves aset of data items at specific coherencies. Just as various fragments of a dynamic webpageare served by one or more nodes of a content distribution network; our technique involvesdecomposing a client query into subqueries and executing subqueries on judiciously …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,22
Delegation in ACTA to control sharing in extended transactions,Panos K.  Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract ACTA is a comprehensive transaction framework that facilitates the formaldescription of properties of extended transaction models. Speci cally; using ACTA; one canspecify and reason about (1) the e ects of transactions on objects and (2) the interactionsbetween transactions. This paper focuses on one of the building blocks of ACTA; namelydelegation. A transaction ti can delegate to tj the responsibility for committing or aborting anoperation op. Once this delegation occurs; it is as if tj performed op and not ti. We discusshow the notion of delegation is useful to capture the interactions that take place in extendedtransactions.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1993,22
Bounds on the performance of heuristic algorithms for multiprocessor scheduling of hard real-time tasks,Fuxing Wang; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,The authors analyze the performance of a heuristic algorithm; H/sub k/; which tries to keep atleast k processors busy; if possible. H/sub k/combines the features of two known heuristicscheduling algorithms: list scheduling and the H scheduling algorithm. The authors analyzeits schedule length bound for both uniform tasks; ie tasks with the same computation time;and nonuniform tasks; ie tasks with arbitrary computation times. When k= 2; the timecomplexity of H is the same as the complexity of the H scheduling algorithm and listscheduling; which is O (n/sup 2/r); where n is the number of tasks and r is the number ofresources. Whereas the H scheduling algorithm has a poor schedule length bound butperforms very well in finding feasible schedules; and list scheduling does not perform well infinding feasible schedules but has a good bound; the results show that H/sub 2/has both …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1992,1992,22

Ratio threshold queries over distributed data sources,Rajeev Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham; Mukesh Mohania,Abstract Continuous aggregation queries over dynamic data are used for real time decisionmaking and timely business intelligence. In this paper we consider queries where a clientwants to be notified if the ratio of two aggregates over distributed data crosses a specifiedthreshold. Consider these scenarios: a mechanism designed to defend against distributeddenial of service attacks may be triggered when the fraction of packets arriving to a subnet ismore than 5% of the total packets; or a distributed store chain withdraws its discount onluxury goods when sales of luxury goods constitute more than 20% of the overall sales. Thechallenge in executing such ratio threshold queries (RTQs) lies in incurring the minimalamount of communication necessary for propagation of updates from data sources to theaggregator node where the client query is executed. We address this challenge by …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,21
Mutual consistency in real-time databases,Abhay Kumar Jha; Ming Xiong; Krithi Ramamritham,A real-time database is composed of real-time objects whose values remain valid only withintheir validity intervals. Each object in the database models a real world entity. The freshnessof these objects is maintained by update transactions that sample the real world entities. Theliterature proposes various ways to derive a schedule of transactions that preserves thefreshness (also known as absolute consistency) of these objects. But these approaches donot take care of the mutual consistency of the objects; ie; whether together they represent alogical state of the system. We investigate the problem of checking whether; given an updatetransaction schedule; a periodic query would be able to read mutually consistent values. Wepropose solutions for both single-and multiple-query cases in the presence of non-preemptable query executions. Specifically; we first investigate formulas that give the …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 2006. RTSS'06. 27th IEEE International,2006,21

Real-time event handling in an RFID middleware system,Kaushik Dutta; Krithi Ramamritham; B Karthik; Kamlesh Laddhad,Abstract Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags have emerged as a key technology forreal-time asset tracking. Wide application of RFID leads to huge amounts of data beinggenerated from scan of each of these RFID tags on individual items; for example; the RFIDsystem of a moderate size retail chain will generate 300 million RFID scans per day.Extracting meaningful information out of this huge amount of scan data is a challenging task.Moreover CIOs are looking for real time business decision from this RFID scan data. In thispaper we show how to add value to an RFID middleware system by enabling it to handle alarge number of RFID scan data and execute business rules in real-time.

Real-time support for mobile robotics,Huan Li; John Sweeney; Krithi Ramamritham; Roderic Grupen; Prashant Shenoy,Coordinated behavior of mobile robots is an important emerging application area. Differentcoordinated behaviors can be achieved by assigning sets of control tasks; or strategies; torobots in a team. These control tasks must be scheduled either locally on the robot ordistributed across the team. An application may have many control strategies to dynamicallychoose from; although some may not be feasible; given limited resource and timeavailability. Thus; dynamic feasibility checking becomes important as the coordinationbetween robots and the tasks that need to be performed evolves with time. This paperpresents an online algorithm for finding a feasible strategy given a functionally equivalentset of strategies for achieving an application's goals.

A unifying framework for transactions in competitive and cooperative environments,Panayiotis K Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Recently; a number of extensions to the traditional transaction model have beenproposed to support new information-intensive applications such as CAD/CAM and softwaredevelopment. However; these extended transaction models capture only a subset ofinteractions that can be found in such applications; and represent only some of the pointswithin the spectrum of interactions possible in competitive and cooperative environments.ACTA is a formalizable framework intended for characterizing the whole spectrum ofinteractions. The ACTA framework is not yet another transaction model; but it consolidatesthe different transaction models into a unified and versatile framework.

A survey of sensory data boundary estimation; covering and tracking techniques using collaborating sensors,Sumana Srinivasan; Subhasri Dattagupta; Purushottam Kulkarni; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Boundary estimation and tracking have important applications in the areas ofenvironmental monitoring and disaster management. A boundary separates two regions ofinterest in a phenomenon. It can be visualized as an edge if there is a sharp change in thefield value between the two regions or alternatively; as a contour with a field value f= τseparating two regions with field values f> τ and f< τ.

Transaction processing in broadcast disk environments,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Arvind Nithrakashyap; Jitendra Padhye; Rajendran Sivasankaran; Ming Xiong; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract An important limitation in broadcast disk environments is the low bandwidthavailable for clients to communicate with servers. Whereas advanced applications in suchenvironments do need transaction processing capabilities; given the asymmetriccommunication bandwidth; we show that serializability is too restrictive in such environmentsand hence propose a weaker alternative. Specifically; this paper considers the execution ofupdates under transactional semantics in broadcast disk environments; and develops aweaker correctness criterion. While this is applicable to transaction processing in general;this paper describes mechanisms to achieve this criterion in broadcast disk environments.We show that read-only transactions need not contact the server and can just readconsistent data “off the air” without; for example; obtaining locks.

In autonomous locking; transactions acquire and releaselocks via operations on shared memory; in contrast to conventional locking where communicationwith a lock manager is involved. We demonstrate the superior performance and scalability ofautonomous locking through benchmarks of a prototype lock manager implemented on a largescale shared memory multiprocessor. For instance; when contention is high (ie; for hot lockoperations); the performance of autonomous locking is nearly an order of magnitude better thanconventional locking.

This thesis is concerned with theapplication of temporal logic to the specification and synthesis of synchronizers. A very highlevel specification language founded on temporal logic is introduced. This language isdesigned for expressing properties required among operations accessing shared resourcesin a concurrent environment. The language posseses constructs for expressing propertiessuch as mutual exclusion of operation execution; priority among operations; invariance ofresource state; and scheduling disciplines. Each of the above is expressed independent ofthe others; resulting in modular specifications. Statements in the language possessappropriate temporal semantics.

Towards predictable transaction executions in real-time database systems,Patrick E O'Neil; Krithi Ramamritham; Calton Pu,Abstract Even though considerable research has been done on concurrency controlprotocols that take the timing constraints of transactions into account; most of these protocolsdo not predict {before a transaction begins execution {whether the transaction will meet itsdeadline. Hence the protocols do not directly tackle the problems introduced by the varioussources of unpredictability encountered in typical database systems; including datadependence of transaction execution; data and resource con icts; dynamic paging in virtualmemory systems; disk I/O; and transaction aborts with the resulting rollbacks and restarts. Onthe other hand; the approach described in this paper has the potential to provide predictabletransaction executions.

Efficient transaction support for dynamic information retrieval systems,Mohan Kamath; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract To properly handle concurrent accesses to documents by updates and queries ininformation retrieval(IR) systems; efforts are on to integrate IR features with databasemanagement system(DBMS) features. However; initial research has revealed that DBMSfeatures optimized for traditional databases; display degraded performance while handlingtext databases. Since efficiency is critical in IR systems; infrastructural extensions arenecessary for several DBMS features; transaction support being one of them. This paperfocuses on developing efficient transaction support for IR systems where updates andqueries arrive dynamically; by exploiting the data characteristics of the indexes as well as ofthe queries and updates that access the indexes.

Database Locking Protocols for Large-Scale Cache-Coherent Shared Memory Multiprocessors: Design; Implementation and Performance,Lory D Molesky; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Signi cant performance advantages can be realized by implementing a databasesystem on a cache-coherent shared memory multiprocessor. An e cient implementation of alock manager is a prerequisite for e cient transaction processing in multiprocessor databasesystems. To this end; we examine two approaches to the implementation of locking in acache-coherent shared memory multiprocessor database system. The rst approach; shared-memory locking (SML); allows each node (processor) of the multiprocessor to acquire andrelease locks directly via the use of cache-coherent shared memory.

Architecture and OS support for predictable real-time systems,Douglas Niehaus; E Nahum; J Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Real-time computer systems present a set of design challenges that are signi cantlydi erent from those of conventional computer systems. In hard real-time systems theexecution of a computation must be guaranteed to nish by a deadline. This means that thecomputation's worst case behavior; which includes its worst case execution time (WCET);must be predictable; so that su cient system resources can be allocated to ensure that it willnish executing by its deadline; even under pathological situations. The designs ofconventional systems generally concentrate on improving average case performance. Incontrast; architectural features in real-time systems must be considered according to their eects on at least three criteria: WCET; execution time variance; and average case executiontime. The average case is still relevant; since when a computation does not exhibit its …,Spring internal document,1992,16
A multi-access window protocol for transmission of time constrained messages,Wei Zhao; John A Stankovic; Krithi Ramamritham,A novel window protocol for transmitting time-constrained messages in a multiaccessnetwork is proposed that explicitly takes time constraints into account. The window is formedon the basis of latest time to send a message (LS). A newly arriving message is immediatelyconsidered for transmission if its LS is less than those of the all pending messages in thesystem. As a result; the protocol closely approximates the optimal minimum-laxity-first policy.A performance evaluation by simulation shows that the protocol performs well in a widerange of environments; even under overloaded conditions.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1988.; 8th International Conference on,1988,16

Dissemination of dynamic data,Pavan Deolasee; Amol Katkar; Ankur Panchbudhe; Krithi Ramamritham; Prashant Shenoy,Abstract—An important issue in the dissemination of timevarying web data such as sportsscores and stock prices is the maintenance of temporal coherency. In the case of serversadhering to the HTTP protocol; clients need to frequently pull the data based on thedynamics of the data and a user's coherency requirements. In contrast; servers that possesspush capability maintain state information pertaining to clients and push only those changesthat are of interest to a user. These two canonical techniques have complementaryproperties with respect to the level of temporal coherency maintained; communicationoverheads; state space overheads; and loss of coherency due to (server) failures.

In this paper we present a new join algorithm called bucket skipmerge join which does not always access all the data items of the join sets. The basic idea isto divide the datasets into buckets that contain monotonically increasing values andmaintain high and low values for each bucket. During join processing; the algorithm usesthese values to skip a whole bucket or parts of a bucket when it can be determined that amatch will not be found for the rest of the data items in the bucket. This considerably reducesthe number of memory accesses; disk accesses and CPU time.

The event representation discussed in this paper accountsfor the important event attributes; namely; time; space; and label. We introduce the notion ofsequence templates that not only provides event related semantics but also helps insemantically analyzing user queries. Finally; we discuss the design for our Query-EventAnalysis System; which is an integrated system to (a) identify a best sequence templategiven a user query;(b) select events based on the best sequence template; and (c) …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,13
Web-cam: monitoring the dynamic web to respond to continual queries,Shaveen Garg; Krithi Ramamritham; Soumen Chakrabarti,While the flexibility and autonomy of information production and sharing on the Web isphenomenal; it is daunting to navigate; collect; process; and track data in this dynamic andopen information space. The problem is aggravated when the sources of information changecontinually and unpredictably; and the queries are Continual Queries; ie; queries for whichresponses given to users must be continually updated; as the sources of interest getupdated. We need to frequently visit the sites of interest and fuse the newly updatedinformation to track the changes to determine if they are relevant to a user's informationneeds. We seek to relieve the user from maintaining personal Web-polling schedules bybuilding Web-CAM; a Web-based Continuous Adaptive Monitoring system. It continuouslypushes the updates to the user while they are still fresh. The term monitoring is used …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,13

ReDAL: an efficient and practical request distribution technique for application server clusters,Kaushik Dutta; Anindya Datta; Debra VanderMeer; Helen Thomas; Krithi Ramamritham,Modern Web-based application infrastructures are based on clustered multitieredarchitectures; where request distribution occurs in two sequential stages: over a cluster ofWeb servers and over a cluster of application servers. Much work has focused on strategiesfor distributing requests across a Web server cluster in order to improve the overallthroughput across the cluster. The strategies applied at the application layer are the same asthose at the Web server layer because it is assumed that they transfer directly. In this paper;we argue that the problem of distributing requests across an application server cluster isfundamentally different from the Web server request distribution problem due to coredifferences in request processing in Web and application servers. We devise an approachfor distributing requests across a cluster of application servers such that the overall …,IEEE transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2007,12
Context aware retrieval in web-based collaborations,Harish Kammanahalli; Srividya Gopalan; V Sridhar; Krithi Ramamritham,Provisioning goal specific information to the team enhances efficiency of the team. Contextawareness is very important to provide such relevant information. We propose a contextaware information retrieval system that retrieves; and presents; information of high utility to auser-taking into account user's implicit need for information; capabilities of the user's accessdevice; and other resource constraints of the user. The information retrieved assists users inachieving the collaboration goals. The proposed context-aware information retrieval systemanalyzes user's history to derive an enhanced" context" that indicates why user needs theinformation and what format of information is most useful for the user. The system uses thiscontext to determine the information most relevant to the immediate goal of the user.,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops; 2004.

Implications of proxy caching for provisioning networks and servers,Mohammad Raunak; Prashant Shenoy; Pawan Goyal; Krithi Ramamritham; Puru Kulkarni,In this paper; we examine the potential benefits of Web proxy caches in improving theeffective capacity of servers and networks. Since networks and servers are typicallyprovisioned based on a high percentile of the load; we focus on the effects of proxy cachingon the tail of the load distribution. We find that; unlike their substantial impact on the averageload; proxies have a diminished impact on the tail of the load distribution. The exactreduction in the tail and the corresponding capacity savings depend on the nature of theworkload and the percentile of the load distribution chosen for provisioning networks andservers-the higher the percentile; the smaller the savings. For workloads considered in thisstudy; compared with over a 50% reduction in the average load; the savings in network andserver capacity was only 20%-35% for the 99th percentile of the load distribution.

CReMeS: a CORBA compliant reflective memory based real-time communication service,Sun-Tae Chung; Oscar Gonzalez; Krithi Ramamritham; Chia Shen,Presents CReMeS (CORBA-compliant Reflective Memory-based Service); a CORBA-compliant design and implementation of a new real-time (RT) communication service. TheCReMeS architecture is based on MidART's RT-CRM (Real-Time Channel-based ReflectiveMemory); which supports the separation of QoS specification between data producers andconsumers and employs a user-level scheduling scheme for communicating RT tasks.Although RT-CRM provides a predictable and scalable asynchronous communicationinfrastructure for applications; it is not a standard middleware. To make its service widelyavailable; we developed CReMeS by adapting RT-CRM for CORBA environments. As aresult; CReMeS provides efficient; predictable and scalable communication betweeninformation producers and consumers.

To schedule or to execute: Decision support and performance implications,Babak Hamidzadeh; Yacine Atif; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract This paper addresses a fundamental trade-off in dynamic scheduling between thecost of scheduling and the quality of the resulting schedules. The time allocated toscheduling must be controlled explicitly; in order to obtain good-quality schedules inreasonable times. As task constraints are relaxed; the algorithms proposed in this paperincrease scheduling complexity to optimize longer and obtain high-quality schedules. Whentask constraints are tightened; the algorithms adjust scheduling complexity to reduce theadverse effect of long scheduling times on the schedule quality. We show that taking intoaccount the scheduling time is crucial for honoring the deadlines of scheduled tasks. Weinvestigate the performance of our algorithms in two scheduling models: one that allows idle-time intervals to exist in the schedule and another that does not. The model with idle-time …,*,1999,12
Accessing extra-database information: Concurrency control and correctness,Narain Gehani; Krithi Ramamritham; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Oded Shmueli,Abstract Traditional concurrency control theory views transactions in terms of read and writeoperations on database items. Thus; the effects of accessing non-database entities; such asthe system clock or the log; on a transaction's behavior are not explicitly considered. In thispaper; we are motivated by a desire to include accesses to such extra-data items within thepurview of transaction and database correctness. We provide a formal treatment ofconcurrency control when transactions are allowed access to extra-data by discussing theinter-transaction dependencies that are induced when transactions access extra-data. Wealso develop a spectrum of correctness criteria that apply when such transactions areconsidered and outline mechanisms to enforce these criteria. Furthermore; we show thatallowing databases to view data which has been traditionally kept hidden from users …,Information Systems,1998,12
Toward formalizing recovery of (advanced) transactions,Cris Pedregal Martin; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Current literature on database transaction recovery reveals a semantic gapbetween high-level requirements (such as the all-or-nothing property) and the low-leveldescriptions of how these requirements are implemented (in terms of buffers and theirpolicies; volatile and persistent storage; shadows; etc.). At the same time; fast growingdemands for recovery in both traditional and advanced transaction models require anincreased understanding of the relationships between requirements and mechanisms; andthe ability to craft recovery more flexibly and modularly. In this chapter we address thesechallenges; introducing a framework to unify the different components of recovery as well asproviding the concepts and notation needd to reason about recovery protocols.

The Gutenberg operating system kernel,Panayiotis Chrysanthis; Krithi Ramamritham; David Stemple; Stephen Vinter,ABSTRACT The Gutenberg system is a port-based; object-oriented operating system kerneldesigned to facilitate the design and structuring of distributed systems. This is achieved byproviding primitives for controlling process interconnections and thereby controlling accessto shared resources. Only shared resources are viewed as protected objects. Processescommunicate with each other and access protected objects through the use of ports. Eachport is associated with an abstract data type operation and can be created by a process onlyif the process possesses the privilege to execute that operation. Capabilities to create portsfor requesting operations are contained in the capability directory which is a kernel object. Atany time; each process is associated with a single subdirectory of the capability directorydesignated as its active directory.

Schedulability analysis of deferrablescheduling algorithms for maintainingreal-time data freshness,Song Han; Deji Chen; Ming Xiong; Kam-yiu Lam; Aloysius K Mok; Krithi Ramamritham,Although the deferrable scheduling algorithm for fixed priority transactions (DS-FP) hasbeen shown to provide a better performance compared with the More-Less (ML) method;there is still a lack of any comprehensive studies on the necessary and sufficient conditionsfor the schedulability of DS-FP. In this paper; we first analyze the necessary and sufficientschedulability conditions for DS-FP; and then propose a schedulability test algorithm for DS-FP by exploiting the fact that there always exists a repeating pattern in a DS-FP schedule. Toresolve the limitation of fixed priority scheduling in DS-FP; we then extend the deferrablescheduling to a dynamic priority scheduling algorithm called DS-EDF by applying theearliest deadline first (EDF) policy to schedule update jobs. We also propose aschedulability test for DS-EDF and compare its performance with DS-FP and ML through …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2014,11
Adaptive coherency maintenance techniques for time-varying data,RK Majumdar; Kannan M Moudgalya; Krithi Ramamritham,Often; data used in online decision making (for example; in determining how to react tochanges in process behavior; traffic flow control; etc.) is dynamic in nature and hence thetimeliness of the data delivered to the decision making process becomes very important. Thedelivered data must conform to certain time or value based application specificinconsistency bounds. A system designed to disseminate dynamic data can exploit user-specified coherency requirements by fetching and disseminating only those changes thatare of interest to users and ignoring immediate changes. But; the design of mechanisms forsuch data delivery is challenging given that dynamic data changes rapidly andunpredictably; the latter making it very hard to use simple prediction techniques. In thispaper; we address these challenges. Specifically; we develop mechanisms to obtain …,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 2003. RTSS 2003. 24th IEEE,2003,11

To minimize the probability ofmissing the arrival deadline associated with each navigation request; we use a time-stampwith prediction scheme to model the traffic data and replicated dynamic directed graphs toorganize the traffic data required for path searching and path calculation. Correctness of thebest path calculations and scalability of the system are improved through an adaptive Pushor Pull (APoP) scheme to monitor the best path and traffic data in navigation.,DEXA Workshops,2003,11
User action recovery in internet sagas (isagas),Kaushik Dutta; Debra VanderMeer; Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract With the expansion of Web sites to include business functions; a user's typicalinteraction with a Web site is a multi-step process. The loss of connection; or other systemfailure; can result in the loss of work accumulated before the disruption. This work must thenbe repeated—often at significant cost in time and computation. In some environments; suchas wireless scenarios; these costs can include battery power as well. This paper presents aprotocol for recovering from such scenarios. We first describe Internet-based interactionsusing the familiar concepts of transactions and recovery. Using these abstractions; we thendescribe a protocol for recovering users to valid states in Internet interactions.,International Workshop on Technologies for E-Services,2001,11
Recovery guarantees in mobile systems,Cris Pedregal Martin; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Mobile applications increasingly require transaction-like properties; particularlythose of recovery. Because there is a lack of abstractions to decompose the machinery ofrecovery; realizing recovery is difficult and error-prone; especially in a novel context likemobile systems. We introduce recovery guarantees to tackle this problem by characterizingthe assurances relevant to recovery that a subsystem must give to another. They describethe whar can be expected but not the how it is implemented for recovery. Guarantees arecomplemented by recovery protocols; which prescribe behaviors subsystems should followin order to take advantage of the guarantees. In this paper we use the notions of recoveryguarantees and protocols to show the relationships; vis-a-vis recovery; between thecomponents of a mobile system.

special section on dependable real-time systems,Neeraj Suri; Krithi Ramamritham,VER time; the discipline of computing systems has evolved and expanded in a multifaceted mannerto cover many distinct and (sometimes) disparate streams.

Specification and analysis of transactions in real-time active databases,Ming Xiong; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The distinction between real-time and non real-time database systems lies in thetiming constraints associated with transactions and data values in the real-time databasesystems. In real-time database systems; transactions have to complete before deadlines;and they have to read data values which are temporally valid because data values maybecome stale with the passage of time. Missing deadlines or using stale data may causedisastrous results in safety critical real-time applications. Examples of such applicationsinclude network services databases [9]; autopilot systems; industrial plant control and robotnavigation. The reliability of such software systems has been of much concern to designersand users. But there has been no work to formalize the properties of transactions in real-timeactive databases. In this paper; we attempt to address this lacuna.,*,1997,11
Verification of a reliable net protocol,Victor Yodaiken; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract We specify and prove correctness of a real-world fault-tolerance algorithm. Thealgorithm; developed by Chang and Maxemchuk [CM84]; guarantees delivery of broadcastmessages over a broadcast medium (eg; an ethernet) in the presence of faults that maycause messages to be lost or only partially delivered. Instead of describing the operation ofthe algorithm in pseudo-code; as the authors of the algorithm have done; we generate aprecise mathematical specification which is amenable to reasonably simple prooftechniques. The formal method that we use in this paper is based on modal (statedependent) functions called the modal primitive recursive (mpr) functions. Our analysisclarifies the workings of the algorithm by discarding the complex program scaffolding thatobscures the original exposition.,International Symposium on Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems,1992,11

Fusing sensors for occupancy sensing in smart buildings,Nabeel Nasir; Kartik Palani; Amandeep Chugh; Vivek Chil Prakash; Uddhav Arote; Anand P Krishnan; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Understanding occupant-building interactions helps in personalized energy andcomfort management. However; occupant identification using affordable infrastructure;remains unresolved. Our analysis of existing solutions revealed that for a building to havereal-time view of occupancy state and use it intelligently; there needs to be a smart fusion ofaffordable; not-necessarily-smart; yet accurate enough sensors. Such a sensor fusionshould aim for minimalistic user intervention while providing accurate building occupancydata. We describe an occupant detection system that accurately monitors the occupants'count and identities in a shared office space; which can be scaled up for a building.Incorporating aspects from data analytics and sensor fusion with intuition; we have built aSmart-Door using inexpensive sensors to tackle this problem.

In this paper; we present SolarCast; acloud-based web service; which automatically generates models that provide customizedsite-specific predictions of future solar generation. SolarCast utilizes a" black box" approachthat requires only i) a site's geographic location and ii) a minimal amount of historicalgeneration data. Since we intend SolarCast for small rooftop deployments; it does notrequire detailed site-and panel-specific information; which owners may not know; butinstead automatically learns these parameters for each site.

Tracking dynamic boundary fronts using range sensors,Subhasri Duttagupta; Krithi Ramamritham; Purushottam Kulkarni; Kannan M Moudgalya,Abstract We examine the problem of tracking dynamic boundaries occurring in naturalphenomena using range sensors. Two main challenges of the boundary tracking problemare energy-efficient boundary estimations from noisy observations and continuous trackingof the boundary. We propose a novel approach which uses a regression-based spatialestimation technique to determine discrete points on the boundary and estimates aconfidence band around the entire boundary. In addition; a Kalman Filter-based temporalestimation technique is used to selectively refresh the estimated boundary to meet theaccuracy requirements.

Handling client mobility and intermittent connectivity in mobile web accesses,Purushottam Kulkarni; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Wireless devices are being increasingly used to access data on the web. Sinceintermittent connectivity and client mobility are inherent in such environments; in this paper;we examine the impact of these factors on coherent dissemination of dynamic web data towireless devices. We introduce the notion of eventual-delta consistency; and in the contextof push and pull-based dissemination propose (i) buffering techniques at the proxy to maskthe effects of client disconnections and (ii) application-level handoff algorithms to handleclient mobility. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that push is better suited to handleclient disconnections due to its lower message overhead and better fidelity; while pull isbetter suited to handle client mobility due to its lower handoff overheads.,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2003,10

Dissemination of dynamic data on the internet,Krithi Ramamritham; Pavan Deolasee; Amol Katkar; Ankur Panchbudhe; Prashant Shenoy,Abstract Dynamic data is data which varies rapidly and unpredictably. This kind of data isgenerally used in on-line decision making and hence needs to be delivered to its usersconforming to certain time or value based application-specific requirements. The main issuein the dissemination of dynamic web data such as stock prices; sports scores or weatherdata is the maintenance of temporal coherency within the user specified bounds. Since mostof the web servers adhere to the HTTP protocol; clients need to frequently pull the datadepending on the changes in the data and user's coherency requirements. In contrast;servers that possess push capability maintain state information pertaining to user'srequirements and push only those changes that are of interest to a user. These twocanonical techniques have complementary properties. In pure pull approach; the level of …,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2000,10

Indexing and Compression in Data Warehouses.,Kiran B Goyal; Krithi Ramamritham; Anindya Datta; Helen M Thomas,Abstract E cient query processing is critical in a data warehouse environment because thewarehouse is very large; queries are often adhoc and complex; and decision supportapplications typically require interactive response times. Existing approaches often useindexes to speed up such queries. However; the addition of index structures can signi cantlyincrease storage costs. In this paper; we consider the application of compression techniquesto data warehouses. In particular; we examine a recently proposed access structure forwarehouses known as DataIndexes; and discuss the application of several wellknowncompression methods to this approach. We also include a brief performance analysis; whichindicates that the DataIndexing approach is well-suited to compression techniques in manycases.,DMDW,1999,10

Computer science research in India,Krithi Ramamritham,The computer industry is playing an increasingly important role in India's economy.However; for a number of reasons; many researchers are not doing high-quality work.Computer science research in India takes place at academic; government-sponsored; andindustry-sponsored institutions. These major institutions can conduct effective researchbecause they have sufficient funding; high-quality programs; good equipment; and aneffective infrastructure. This is not the case at India's many other institutions. Many localobservers say that Indian computer scientists make advances in existing areas of researchbut rarely do cutting-edge work. This occurs; in part; because many Indian computerscientists receive little direction and have few co-workers in their fields; which means theywork in relative isolation.,Computer,1997,10

Such systemsmust consider the worst case; rather than the average case; behavior of the system andapplication software. The Spring system uses a scheduler constructing explicit plans forexecuting application programs to ensure that both logical and temporal constraints aresatisfied. Such scheduling requires a detailed representation of the worst case run-timebehavior of the application.

Theseinclude the intelligent network services database described in [5] and the mobiletelecommunication system discussed in [29]. More recent applications include the multitudeof directory; data-feed and electronic commerce services that have become available on theWorld Wide Web. An essential requirement for most distributed real-time database system(DRTDBS) applications is transaction atomicity–this is satisfied by implementing atransaction commit protocol. Commit protocols typically require exchange of multiplemessages; in multiple phases; between the participating sites where the distributedtransaction executed.

We develop a datadissemination technique for the Web where (a) such queries access data from multiplesources and (b) the HTTP protocol; which is inherently pull based; is used for accessing thesources. Key challenges in supporting such queries; which also arise in a diverse set ofcontexts including monitoring of patients; network traffic; and experiments; lie in meetingusers' consistency requirements while minimizing network and server overheads; withoutthe loss of fidelity in the responses provided to users.

Recovery protocols for shared memory database systems,Lory D Molesky; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Significant performance advantages can be gained by implementing a databasesystem on a cache-coherent shared memory multiprocessor. However; problems arise whenfailures occur. A single node (where a node refers to a processor/memory pair) crash mayrequire a reboot of the entire shared memory system. Fortunately; shared memorymultiprocessors that isolate individual node failures are currently being developed. Evenwith these; because of the side effects of the cache coherency protocol; a transactionexecuting strictly on a single node may become dependent on the validity of the memory ofmany nodes thereby inducing unnecessary transaction aborts. This happens whendatabase objects; such as records; and database support structures; such as indexstructures and shared lock tables; are stored in shared memory.

Proxy-based caching approaches store content at various locationsoutside the site infrastructure and can improve Web site performance by reducing contentgeneration delays; firewall processing delays; and bandwidth requirements. However;existing proxy-based caching approaches either:(a) cache at the page level; which does notguarantee that correct pages are served and provides very limited reusability; or (b) cache atthe fragment level; which requires the use of pre-defined page layouts. To address theseissues; several back end caching approaches have been proposed; including query resultcaching and fragment level caching. While back end approaches guarantee the …,Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Based Information Systems; 2002.(WECWIS 2002). Proceedings. Fourth IEEE International Workshop on,2002,8
Applying parallel processing techniques in data warehousing and OLAP,Anindya Datta; Debra VanderMeer; Krithi Ramamritham; Bongki Moon,Abstract We explore the applicability of parallel processing techniques for OLAP queryprocessing. In particular; we exploit the natural partitionability of a star schema and render iteven more e cient by applying a storage and access structure that serves both as an indexas well as data and lends itself naturally to vertical partitioning of the data. We propose adeclustering strategy which incorporates both task and data partitioning and present theParallel Star Join (PSJ) algorithm; which provides a means to perform a star join in parallelusing e cient operations involving only rowsets and projection columns. We compare theperformance of this algorithm with two parallel query processing strategies. The rst strategyis a parallel join strategy utilizing the Bitmap Join Index (BJI); arguably the state of the artOLAP join structure in use today. For the second strategy we choose a well known …,submitted for publication,1998,8
" Have your Data and Index it; too". Efficient Storage and Indexing for Data Warehouses,Anindya Datta; Bongki Moon; Krithi Ramamritham; Helen Thomas; Igor Viguier,Abstract Two possible strategies may be utilized to enhance the efficiency of processingOLAP queries:(a) precomputation strategies (eg; view materialization; realizing data cubes);and (b) ad-hoc strategies. While a significant amount of work has been done in developingprecomputation strategies; it is generally recognized that it is difficult to materialize theanswers to all possible queries. Thus; ad-hoc querying must be supported in datawarehouses. This realization has sparked an interest in exploring indexing strategiessuitable for OLAP queries. There appears to have been relatively little work done in ad-hocquery support for data warehouses [45; 46; 55; 39]. In this paper we propose DataIndexes asa new paradigm for storing the base data. An attractive feature of DataIndexes is that theyserve as indexes as well as the store of base data. Thus; DataIndexes actually define a …,*,1998,8
Window MAC protocols for real-time communication services,K Arvind; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Abstract In this paper; we consider a distributed real-time system based on a local areanetwork with a bus topology; and propose a new suite of real-time medium access controlprotocols. The proposed suite is devoid of deficiencies (in supporting real-timecommunication) found in existing standards for bus-based systems. The suite consists of fivemedium access control protocols; viz.; PRI; RTDG; RTVC; INTPVC; and INTPDG; all basedon a uniform window splitting paradigm. The proto-col PRI implements priority-based on auniform window splitting paradigm. The protocol RTDG implements real-time datagramarbitration; and the protocol RTVC may be used to implement the abstraction of real-timevirtual circuits. The protocols INTPVC and INTPDG are integrated protocols that may beused to support both real-time datagram and real-time virtual circuit arbi-tration in an …,*,1991,8

Functional addressing in Gutenberg: Interprocess communication without process identifiers,David W Stemple; Stephen T Vinter; Krithivasan Ramamritham,An interprocess communication facility provided by the kernel of the Gutenberg experimentaloperating system is presented. In Gutenberg all interprocess communication is via channels(ports) that are typed by the service which can be requested on them. Ports are created byreference to their service without using the identifier of the process providing the service; atechnique the authors refer to as functional addressing. By using functional addressing;interprocess transfer of port use privileges and a new concept of cooperation class; arbitraryprocess interconnection topologies can be achieved without any explicit use of processidentifiers by processes. Examples of object sharing with abstract data type managers anddata-driven protocols of database query execution are presented to illustrate the methods ofconstructing systems of cooperation processes using the Gutenberg system.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1986,8
Privilege transfer and revocation in a port-based system,Krithivasan Ramamritham; David Stemple; David A Briggs; Stephen Vinter,Gutenberg is a port-based operating system being designed to study protection issues indistributed systems. All shared resources are viewed as protected objects and hence can beassessed only via specific operations defined on them. Processes communicate and accessobjects through the use of ports. Each port is associated with an abstract data type operationand can be created by a process only if the process has the capability to execute theoperation on the type. Thus; a port represents the privilege of the port's client process torequest a service. Capabilities to create ports for requesting operations are contained in acapability directory; which is navigated by processes to gain these capabilities. Privilegetransfer is a means of providing servers access to the resources they need to perform theirservices. In Gutenberg; privilege transfer is accomplished by allowing access to …,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1986,8
Putting smart meters to work: Beyond the usual,Kartik Palani; Nabeel Nasir; Vivek Chil Prakash; Amandeep Chugh; Rohit Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The paper shows how smart meters can be put to work; beyond their traditional use;towards explaining abnormal and unexpected patterns in the behavior of electricalappliances. We describe two kinds of uses; by visualizing and analyzing smart meter datafor an academic building. The first gives us the ability to find anomalous appliance behaviorsand the other helps to discover sub-optimal energy consumption patterns. The goal is tostress the fact that the ubiquitous smart meter can act as a sensor not only for monitoringconsumption but also for detecting interesting energy usage patterns.,Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Future energy systems,2014,7

Discovering critical edge sequences in e-commerce catalogs,Kaushik Dutta; Debra VanderMeer; Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Web sites allow the collection of vast amounts of navigational data--clickstreams ofuser traversals through the site. These massive data stores offer the tantalizing possibility ofuncovering interesting patterns within the dataset. For e-businesses; always looking for anedge in the hyper-competitive online marketplace; this possibility is of particular interest. Ofsignificant particular interest to e-businesses is the discovery of Critical Edge Sequences(CES); which denote frequently traversed subpaths in the catalog. CESs can be used toimprove site performance and site management; increase the effectiveness of advertising onthe site; and gather additional knowledge of customer interest patterns on the site. Usingtraditional graph-based and web mining strategies to find CESs could turn out to beexpensive in both space and time.

Enabling generic keyword search over raw XML data,Manoj K Agarwal; Krithi Ramamritham,Classical XML keyword search based on the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) frameworkrequires users to be well versed with data and semantic relationships between the querykeywords to extract meaningful response; restricting its applicability. GKS (Generic KeywordSearch); on the other hand; allows users to browse and navigate XML data without suchconstraints. GKS enables discovery of deeper insights (DI) in the XML data; found in thecontext of the search results. Such insights not only expose patterns hidden in the searchresults but also help users tune their queries; thus enabling the navigation of complex XMLrepositories with ease. We further show how; for a search query; different insights can bediscovered from the data by varying a single parameter.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6
Category-Based Infidelity Bounded Queries over Unstructured Data Streams,Manish Bhide; Krithi Ramamritham,We present the Caicos system that supports continuous infidelity bounded queries over adata stream; where each data item (of the stream) belongs to multiple categories. Caicos ismade up of four primitives: Keywords; Queries; Data items; and Categories. A Category is avirtual entity consisting of all those data items that belong to it. The membership of a dataitem to a category is decided by evaluating a Boolean predicate (associated with eachcategory) over the data item. Each data item and query in turn are associated with multiplekeywords. Given a keyword query; unlike conventional unstructured data queryingtechniques that return the top-(K) documents; Caicos returns the top-(K) categories withinfidelity less than the user specified infidelity bound. Caicos is designed to continuouslytrack the evolving information present in a highly dynamic data stream. It; hence …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,6
TL-Tree: flash-optimized storage for time-series sensing data on sensor platforms,Huan Li; Dong Liang; Lihui Xie; Gong Zhang; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Extending NAND flash to off-the-shelf sensor platforms has great potential forimproving in-network processing for sensor networks. However; due to the specificread/write characteristics of NAND; the strict resource constraints of sensor devices; eg;main memory and energy; and the time-series sensing property of sensor applications;designing an efficient resource-aware flash storage system on sensor platforms is achallenging work. In this paper; we propose Time-Log Tree (TL-Tree); a novel indexingstructure that is designed to consider time-series as a primary characteristic for optimizingboth memory and energy constraints. TL-Tree is an unbalanced tree tailored to temporalsensor data.

SParK: safety partition kernel for integrated real-time systems,S Ghaisas; Gopinath Karmakar; D Shenai; S Tirodkar; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In safety critical systems; huge manpower and cost goes towards the qualificationand certification of software that requires rigorous V&V (Verification & Validation) effort. Inpractice it has been observed that considerable parts of a safety-critical software do notperform safety-critical tasks (eg; communication to operator station; hardware diagnostics).Therefore; if the non-critical modules of the class IA/IB systems are partitioned and if theintegrity of the partitions is ensured while sharing the same hardware; V&V effort can beminimized while reducing hardware resource needs. We have designed and implemented aSafety Partition Kernel (SParK) to provide such a strictly partitioned operating environment;where partitions reside on top of SParK and are provided with temporal guarantees andspatial isolation from each other.

Efficient execution of continuous incoherency bounded queries over multi-source streaming data,Manish Bhide; Krithi Ramamritham; Mukund Agrawal,On-line decision making often involves query processing over time-varying data whicharrives in the form of data streams from distributed locations. In such environments typically;a user application is interested in the value of some function defined over the data items. Forexample; the traffic management system can make control decisions based on the observedtraffic at major intersections; stock investors can manage their investments based on thevalue of their portfolios. In this paper we present a system that supports pull based datarefresh and query processing techniques where such queries access data from multipledistributed sources. Key challenges in supporting such Continuous Multi-Data IncoherencyBounded Queries lie in minimizing network and source overheads; without loss of fidelity inthe query responses provided to users. We address these challenges by using …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007. ICDCS'07. 27th International Conference on,2007,6

The event representation discussed in this paper accounts for three important eventattributes; namely; time; space; and label. We introduce the notion of sequence templatesthat appears natural for capturing event related semantics; and in semantically analyzinguser queries. To harness this potential; we present a formal structure to represent thequeries related to real world events as well as an approach to semantically analyze a userquery; and collate event related information to be dispatched to the user.

System failure and recovery,Rajendran M Sivasankaran; Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic,Current databases need logging and recovery to maintain the correctness properties oftransactions and consistency of the database under failures. Also; logging and recoveryhave tremendous performance implications. While there has been a lot of work that dealswith logging and recovery algorithms for traditional disk resident databases ([1; 2; 3; 4; 5])and Main Memory Databases (MMDB)([6; 7]); researchers have not systematically exploredthe issue of logging and recovery in Real-Time Databases (RTDB). In fact; there is a needfor designing new algorithms for logging and recovery in RTDBs because the sequentialnature of logging and the lack of time and priority cognizance during recovery are not in tunewith the priority oriented and preemptive nature of activities in RTDBs.,*,2002,6
Deriving deadlines and periods for update transactions in real-time databases,Ming Xiong; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Typically; temporal validity of real-time data is maintained by periodic updatetransactions. In this paper; we examine the problem of period and deadline assignment forthese update transactions such that (1) these transactions can be guaranteed to complete bytheir deadlines and (2) the imposed workload is minimized. To this end; we propose a novelapproach; named More-Less principle. By applying this principle; updates occur with aperiod which is more than the period obtained through traditional approaches but with adeadline which is less than the traditional period. We show that the More-Less principle isbetter than existing approaches in terms of schedulability and the imposed load.

In this article; we present a novel architecture; called VeShare; to supporthighly dynamic and time-sensitive social behaviors in vehicle networks. VeShare clearlyseparates a vehicle network into control and data planes. The control plane is managed bythe cellular infrastructure. It manages the social networks over time and makes variousdecisions necessary for data transfer. The data plane simply forwards data; following thedecision from the control plane. The clear separation of the control and data planes allowsefficient social group management and data transfer.

Building energy loads aredominated by thermostatically controlled electrical devices (TCEDs) such as air-conditionersand heaters and these loads must be scheduled to deliver the desired thermal comfort bymaintaining the temperature of a given environment within a band. Even though the periodicduty-cycle of TCEDs appears to make real-time scheduling algorithms suitable for thescheduling of TCEDs; we find that existing policies are not suitable for the coordinatedcontrol of TCED loads.

Given the size of data; metadata suchas index structures become even more important in these systems---data is accessed onlyafter processing the metadata; both of which will reside on tertiary storage. The focus of thispaper is on {\em query and transaction processing} in such systems; with emphasis on {\emmetadata management}. The performance in these systems can be measured in terms of the{\em response time} for the queries and the {\em recency} or age of the items retrieved. Bothneed to be minimized. The key to satisfying the performance requirements is to exploit the …,*,1995,4

Demo abstract: Demonstration of using sensor fusion for constructing a cost-effective smart-door,Vivek Chil Prakash; Anand Krishnan Prakash; Uddhav Arote; Vitobha Munigala; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract As buildings get smarter they need to be aware of their spaces and occupants toimprove prediction and management of energy consumption and environment customizationbased on user preference. User identification is crucial to this. However; accuracy ofidentification; intrusiveness and cost are important factors that one considers beforeinstalling such a system. Accounting for these factors; we built a Smart-Door thatincorporates fusion of not-so-smart sensors; soft information available and learningalgorithms to build an economical and accurate user identification system that requires nouser intervention to monitor the occupant count and identities in a shared office space thatcan be scaled up to a building. It provides real-time occupancy status for the area and it canalso learn to identify new users.

Scalable Execution of Continuous Aggregation Queries over Web Data,Rajeev Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham,Data delivered over the Internet is increasingly being used to provide dynamic andpersonalized user experiences. Queries over fast-changing data from distributed datasources are executed to create content to be delivered to users. Because these queriesrequire data from multiple sources; they're executed at intermediate proxies or dataaggregators. The authors discuss various techniques for executing aggregation queries overdistributed data to minimize the number of message exchanges between data sources;aggregators; and users. They carefully examine the problem in terms of different types ofqueries; aggregation functions; query imprecisions; and whether the aggregators get datafrom sources using pull-or push-based mechanisms.,IEEE Internet Computing,2012,3
Feedback control of Internet applications involving the tracking of dynamic data,Shweta B Shah; Kannan M Moudgalya; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Control of computing systems is different in many ways from the control ofconventional systems. The quality of service problem in internet applications; that is;reducing the network overhead without affecting the quality; has been studied in detail.Network overhead can be measured in terms of the number of refreshes of the dynamicdata. Use of randomly generated input vectors allows early use of feedback control; therebylowering the network overhead. Identification using moving time windows helps obtainlocally accurate models; thereby increasing the efficacy of the control scheme. Online tuningof the maximum permissible change in the input; namely maximum time till next refresh; hasbeen shown to improve the control performance. Because this approach is not controllerspecific; it would be of use to all controllers. Two different ways of formulating the linear …,IFAC Proceedings Volumes,2008,3
From Real to Media Anchors: Experiments with the anchored instruction of nomadic children,MV Ananthakrishnan; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The nomadic tribes in India show very little concern for educating their children and;because of their wandering nature; it has become near impossible to have a continuum intheir education; even if it made available. The authors have made an in depth study of threetribes in Maharashtra (India) over a period of four months and evaluated the variousresources and methods that could be exploited successfully in sustained education of thechildren. It included a comparative study of media versus traditional teaching; instructionaltechnologies rich in physical resources and exploiting the typical nomad locale usinganchored instruction. Historically; anchored instruction talks of media resources being usedas anchors in classrooms.

ReDAL: Request Distribution for the Application Layer,Debra VanderMeer; Helen Thomas; Kaushik Dutta; Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamritham,Modern application infrastructures are based on clustered; multi-tiered architectures; whererequest distribution occurs in two sequential stages: over a cluster of Web servers; and overa cluster of application servers. Much work has focused on strategies for distributingrequests across a Web server cluster in order to improve overall throughput across thecluster. The strategies applied at the application layer are the same as those at the Webserver layer; because it is assumed that they transfer directly. In this paper; we argue that theproblem of distributing requests across an application server cluster is fundamentallydifferent from the Web server request distribution problem; due to core differences in requestprocessing in Web and application servers. We devise an approach for distributing requestsacross a cluster of application servers such that overall system throughput is enhanced …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2005. ICDCS 2005.

DELite: database support for embedded lightweight devices,Krithi Ramamritham; Rajkumar Sen,Computation platforms have extended to small intelligent devices like cellphones; sensors;smartcards; PDAs; etc. As new function- alities and features are being added to thesedevices; increasing number of applications are being developed; many of them dealing withsignificant amounts of data leading to the need of embedded database support on these devices[1]. The queries go beyond sim- ple Select-Project-Join queries but still have to be locally executedon the device [4]. Most of the modern day cellphones are being equipped with increasing memorywhich means more data centric applications are being developed for them.

Pragmatic Issues in Failure Handling and Coordinated Execution of Workflows in Distributed Workflow Control Architectures,M Kamath; K Ramamritham,Abstract Recently there has been an increasing interest in workflow correctness and failurehandling requirements; mostly in the context of centralized workflow control architectures.Centralized workflow control however suffers from reliability and scalability problems due tothe use of a central engine to manage state information of all workflows in progress. Adistributed workflow control architecture on the other hand offers much better reliability andscalability. However; developing mechanisms for handling correctness and failurerequirements for distributed workflow control requires careful consideration of a number ofpragmatic issues. In this paper we discuss some of these issues based on the experiencegained while designing a rule-based prototype distributed workflow management system.Agents in distributed workflow control are responsible for both step execution and …,*,1998,3
ARIES/RH: Robust Support for Delegation by Rewriting History,Cris Pedregal Martin; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The notion of transaction delegation; as introduced in ACTA; has been shown to beuseful in synthesizing Extended Transaction Models. Delegation allows a transaction totransfer responsibility over an object; and its operations; to another transaction. Delegationcan be used to broaden the visibility of the delegatee; and to tailor the recovery properties ofa transaction model. The broadening of visibility is useful in allowing a delegator toselectively make tentative and partial results; as well as hints such as coordinationinformation; accessible to other transactions. The control of the recovery makes it possible todecouple the fate of an update from that of the transaction that made the updates forinstance; a transaction may delegate some operations that will remain uncommitted but validafter the delegator transaction aborted.

A Flexible Transaction Facility for an Object-Oriented Database,A Biliris; S Dar; N Gehani; H Jagadish; K Ramamritham,Abstract Object-oriented databases were motivated by the needs of complex applicationssuch as CAD and software engineering. Transactions in such applications have diverseneeds: they may be long lived and they may need to cooperate. This paper describes aexible transaction facility; for an object-oriented database; consisting of a set of transactionmodeling primitives that allow users to de ne customized transaction semantics matching theneeds of speci c applications. We show how the transaction primitives can be used tospecify di erent transaction models; including nested transactions; split transactions; sagas;and several other extended transaction models described in the literature.,Submitted for publication,1992,3

Specifying and verifying a real-time priority queue with modal algebra,Victor Yodaiken; Krithi Ramamritham,The authors use the modal primitive recursive (MPR) arithmetic to facilitate definition;composition; and reasoning about the very large-scale finite state machines that representsubstantive real-time systems. The MPR arithmetic provides a language of integer-valuedfunctions which allow for compact and intuitive specification of state machines withoutenumeration of state sets or transition functions. The MPR arithmetic proof system isintended to be as close as possible to the proof system of classical algebra. The expressiverange of the language extends from detailed description of multilevel concurrent algorithmsto abstract properties of liveness and safety in a style similar to that of the temporal logics.The behavior of a real-time priority queue or communication pipeline is specified with MPRas an example; and the correctness of an implementation is verified.,Real-Time Systems Symposium; 1990.

On synchronization and its specification,Krithivasan Ramamritham; Robert M Keller,Abstract We introduce a very high level language for specifying synchronization properties. Itis designed using the primitives of temporal logic which facilitates the specification of bothinvariant and time-dependent properties. The paper begins with a discussion of propertiesthat affect synchronization. The specification language then introduced features constructs toexpress each of these in a fairly natural and modular fashion. Since the statements in thelanguage have intuitive interpretations; specifications are humanly readable. Also; sincethey possess appropriate formal semantics; unambiguous specifications result.,International Conference on Parallel Processing,1981,3
Observability: A Principled Approach to Provisioning Sensors in Buildings,Anshul Agarwal; Vitobha Munigala; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Sensor driven building management involves tasks like reducing and optimizingpower consumption; monitoring the health of the building appliances; maintaining quality ofthe atmosphere in the building and tracking occupants in various parts of the building (usefulfor purposes such as building safety and emergency evacuation) to name a few. Thisdemands observation of various influencing factors on a continuous/regular basis. We callthese factors" facets of observability". One simple approach for observing these facets is toplace sensors at all the nodes or locations which need to be monitored. However; installingnumerous sensors in different parts of the building can a) be tedious and expensive b)cause inconvenience to the users c) increase the Return on Investment period and; d) affectthe aesthetics of the building.

Online mode switch algorithms for maintaining data freshness in dynamic cyber-physical systems,Song Han; Kam-Yiu Lam; Deji Chen; Ming Xiong; Jiantao Wang; Krithi Ramamritham; Aloysius K Mok,Maintaining the freshness of real-time data is one of the crucial design issues in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Past studies have focused on designing update algorithms tominimize the workload imposed by a fixed set of update tasks while ensuring the temporalvalidity of data. In this paper; we revisit this problem in dynamic cyber-physical systems(DCPS) which may exhibit multi-modal behavior. Any solution to this problem mustrecognize that:(1) different update algorithms may be needed in different modes accordingto the workload in each mode; and (2) temporal validity of data must be maintained not onlyin each mode but also during the mode switch. To strike a balance between data freshnessand system schedulability; we propose a utilization-based scheduling selection (UBSS)strategy.

Keyword search on microblog data streams: finding contextual messages in real time,Manoj K Agarwal; Divyam Bansal; Mridul Garg; Krithi Ramamritham,ABSTRACT Microblogging streams contain information pertaining to emerging real worldevents. Due to the rapid pace at which these data streams are generated; it is often difficultfor users to discover the most relevant messages in the context of their keyword queries.Search over such data streams returns the most recent messages only; most recentmessages may not be the most relevant messages. Hence users have to resort to thecumbersome task of sifting through a large amount of information to obtain the context of alive event. We present a novel real time search system–Contextual Event Search–ondynamic message streams; to extract meaningful summaries for live events in real time. Ourtechnique is unsupervised and automatically identifies different facets of the live events in ascalable and effective manner.,Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT),2016,2

Managing RFID events in large-scale distributed RFID infrastructures,Kaushik Dutta; Debra VanderMeer; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract As RFID installations become larger and more geographically distributed; theirscalability becomes a concern. Currently; most RFID processing occurs in a central location;gathering tag scans and matching them to event-condition-action (ECA) rules. However; asthe number of scans and ECA rules grows; the workload quickly outpaces the capacity of acentralized processing server. In this paper; we consider the problem of distributing the RFIDprocessing workload across multiple nodes in the system. We describe the problem; andpresent an overview of our approach. We then formulate two decision models for distributingthe processing across the system. One generates an optimal allocation based on globalawareness of the state of the system. This problem is NP-hard and assumes that bandwidthand processing resource availability is known in a central location; which is unrealistic in …,Information Technology and Management,2011,2

Maintaining coherent views over dynamic distributed data,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Data delivered today over the web reflects rapid and unpredictable changes in theworld around us. We are increasingly relying on content that provides dynamic; interactive;personalized experiences. To achieve this; the content of most web pages is createddynamically; by executing queries dynamically; using data that changes dynamically fromdistributed sources identified dynamically. A typical web page presents a “view” of the worldconstructed from multiple sources. In this paper; we examine the nature of dynamics ofdistributed data and discuss fresh approaches to maintain the coherency of the views seenby the users. Achieving such coherency while developing scalable low-overhead solutionsposes challenges in terms of delivering data with the required fidelity in spite of datadynamics.

Algorithms for automatic merging of vehicles,Gurulingesh Raravi; Vipul Shingde; Prakhar Goyal; Krithi Ramamritham; Ashish Gudhe,Abstract Automakers are trying to make vehicles more intelligent and safe by embeddingprocessors which can be used to implement “by-wire” applications for taking smart decisionson the road or assisting the driver in doing the same. Given this proliferation; there is a needto minimize the computational capacity required without affecting the performance andsafety of the applications.

Tracking dynamics using sensor networks: some recurring themes,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Much of the data consumed today is dynamic; typically gathered from distributedsources including sensors; and used in real-time monitoring and decision makingapplications. Large scale sensor networks are being deployed for applications such asdetecting leakage of hazardous material; tracking forest fires or environmental monitoring.Many of these “natural” phenomena require estimation of their future states; based on theobserved dynamics. Strategically deployed sensors can operate unattended (minimizing riskto human life) and provide the ability to continuously monitor the phenomena and helprespond to the changes in a timely manner.

Taming the dynamics of distributed data,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The Internet and the web are increasingly used to disseminate fast changing datasuch as sensor data; weather information; stock prices; sports scores; and even healthmonitoring information. These data items are highly dynamic; ie; the data changescontinuously and rapidly; streamed in real-time; ie; new data can be viewed as beingappended to the old or historical data; and aperiodic; ie; the time between the updates andthe value of the updates are not known a priori. Increasingly; more and more users areinterested in monitoring such data for on-line decision making. Traditional disseminationmethods involve a pull or a push of data between a source of the data and a client. However;resource limitations at the source limits the number of users that can be served directly by it.,Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 63,2007,2

Adaptive location management in mobile environments,Krithi Ramamritham; Ming Xiong,Abstract Location management in mobile environments consists of two major operations:location update and paging. The more up-to-date the location information; the less pagingbecomes necessary and vice versa. The conventional approach is the location area basedapproach (LA-based approach); where a location area (LA) consists of multiple cells. Whenthe mobile station (MS) enters a new location area; the MS immediately updates its locationinformation at the new location's visitor location register (VLR) and this update is propagatedto the MS's home location register (HLR). The major drawback of the LA-based approach isthat it does not consider any mobility patterns; or call arrival patterns. Moreover; MS updatesfrequently when it roams only within the boundary cells of different location areas; resultingin unnecessary location updates. So; there is a need for an efficient algorithm which can …,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2003,2

A transaction permit an application to ensure consistency of theinformation it stores in the directory. For example; should an application need to maintainconsistent information across more than one directory entry; without transactions thepotential exists for a failure to occur after one entry is modified but before the second one is.Moving an entry from one directory to another would require the entry to be deleted from oneLDAP directory and adding to another.

Fundamentals of EDF scheduling,John A Stankovic; Marco Spuri; Krithi Ramamritham; Giorgio C Buttazzo,Abstract This chapter discusses the basic results for the EDF scheduling algorithm;regarding optimality and feasibility analysis; respectively. The optimality of a real-timescheduling algorithm means that whenever a task set can be scheduled to meet all itsdeadlines; then it will be feasibly scheduled by the optimal algorithm. Usually; a real-timescheduling algorithm must guarantee a priori that all deadlines of a particular task set aremet. The problem is thus to establish whether a given task set can be feasibly scheduled bythe chosen algorithm. In the literature; a solution to this problem is termed feasibilityanalysis. In this chapter; the optimality of the EDF algorithm; and a feasibility analysis for tasksets; when EDF scheduling is assumed; are described in detail.,*,1998,2
Developing predictable and flexible distributed real-time systems,Juan Manuel Adán-Coello; Maurı́cio F Magalhães; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Predictability is considered the most distinguishing characteristic of real-timesystems.

Flexibility is oneof the main concerns of STER's programming model; based on the construction of reusablesoftware modules. Modules can be reused with different timing constraints without having tobe recoded; since the specification of their timing constraints is decoupled from theirimplementation.

Locating and Sizing Smart Meter Deployment in Buildings,Anand Krishnan Prakash; Vivek Chil Prakash; Bhavin Doshi; Uddhav Arote; Pallab Kumar Sahu; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The use of smart-meters is proliferating; they are now being deployed withoutasking the obvious question: Do we really need each of them? Beyond the cost of smart-meters; there are overheads related to installation; wiring; etc. To formally tackle thisquestion; we first define the notion of observability that one or more pieces of information(including that from smart-meters) enable. This notion allows us to compare two differentdeployments of sensors with respect to their information content and their usefulness. Wethen examine some commonly available information from which one can infer powerconsumption of devices in a given space. We show how we have applied this approach tosystematically decide the optimal number and location of smart-meters to ensureobservability of consumption by different parts of a building.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Sixth International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2015,1
Timely query processing in smart electric grids: Algorithms and performance,Kedar Khandeparkar; Krithi Ramamritham; Rajeev Gupta; Anil Kulkarni; Gopal Gajjar; Shreevardhan Soman,Abstract Smart-grid applications have widely varying data needs as well as bandwidth andlatency requirements. The usual approach to collecting the available data (eg; from PhasorMeasurement Units) at a centralized site continuously and executing all the applicationsthere leads to large latencies and requirements for high communication bandwidth. Thispaper proposes and evaluates; using real data; techniques wherein the data packets aredisseminated based on the applications' data needs and semantics. These techniquessystematically filter data in the dissemination network and reduce bandwidth requirementswhile resulting in low latency solutions. For example; based on the results from our testbedfor the Indian Electric Grid; we show that the processing overheads decrease by at least50% for the large PMU data sizes compared to the traditional centralized approach.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Sixth International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2015,1
Brownout Energy Distribution Scheme for Mitigating Rolling Blackouts,Samrudha Kelkar; Nimish Kothari; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Large imbalance in energy generation and demand is usually handled throughload shedding specific areas during different times of a day. Instead of a complete blackout;we have prototyped a brownout energy distribution scheme wherein a pre-determinedguaranteed level of power required for essential loads is provided to all consumers. Andconsumers have the flexibility to choose which devices they want to power-up.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Sixth International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2015,1
Distributed execution of continuous queries,Rajeev Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham,Data delivered over the internet is increasingly being used for providing dynamic andpersonalized user experiences. To achieve this; queries are executed over fast changingdata from distributed sources. As these queries require data from multiple sources; thesequeries are executed at an intermediate proxy or data aggregator. Typically; users of thesequeries are not interested in all the data updates. Query results may be associated with animprecision bound or threshold which can be used to limit the number of refresh messages.These queries can be categorized based on the types of results required: in an entity basedquery the user is just interested in knowing the ids of the data items (or entities) satisfyingcertain selection condition; in a value based query the user is interested in the value of someaggregation over distributed data items; and in a threshold query the user wants to know …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,1

Partitioned environment for Programmable Controller in safety applications,Gopinath Karmakar; Ashutosh Kabra; RK Patil; Krithi Ramamritham,Use of Programmable Controllers (PLC) in safety-critical applications is gaining importanceas a pre-qualified development platform to reduce Verification and Validation (V &V) effort. Ithas been observed; in practice; that most of the safety-critical functions are fairly simple andis achieved by only a small fraction of a large safety-critical software. This motivates thedevelopment of a partitioned operating environment for PLC; so that less critical componentsof the large safety-critical software can be partitioned from those; which are actuallyperforming safety-critical functions. It will facilitate less rigorous V &V for less critical modulesto get necessary approval for safety-critical system from regulatory authorities.

Semantics-based Concurrency Control,Krithi Ramamritham; Panos K Chrysanthis,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1
Resource management for real-time tasks in mobile robotics,Huan Li; Krithi Ramamritham; Prashant Shenoy; Roderic A Grupen; John D Sweeney,Abstract Coordinated behavior of mobile robots is an important emerging application area.Different coordinated behaviors can be achieved by assigning sets of control tasks; orstrategies; to robots in a team. These control tasks must be scheduled either locally on therobot or distributed across the team. An application may have many control strategies todynamically choose from; although some may not be feasible; given limited resource andtime availability. Thus; dynamic feasibility checking becomes important as the coordinationbetween robots and the tasks that need to be performed evolves with time. This paperpresents an on-line algorithm for finding a feasible strategy given a functionally equivalentset of strategies for achieving an application's goals. We present two algorithms for feasibilityimprovement. Both consider communication cost and utilization bound to make resource …,Journal of Systems and Software,2007,1

In situations in which task running times are not known a priori; ie; at designtime; dynamic scheduling approaches attempt to guarantee; at run time; that tasks will meettheir deadlines.

E cient Concurrency Control for Broadcast Environments,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Arvind Nithrakashyap; Rajendran Sivasankaran; Krithi Ramamritham,Many emerging database applications; especially those with numerous concurrent clients;demand the broadcast mode for data dissemination. For example; in electronic commerceapplications; such as auctions; it is expected that a typical auction might bring togethermillions of interested parties even though only a small fraction may actually o er bids.Updates based on the bids made must be disseminated promptly and consistently.Fortunately; the relatively small size of the database; ie; the current state of the auction;makes broadcasting feasible. But; the communication bandwidth available for a client tocommunicate with servers is likely to be quite restricted. Thus; an attractive approach is touse the broadcast medium to transmit the current state of the auction while allowing theclients to communicate their updates (to the current state of the auction) using low …,Computer Science Department Faculty Publication Series,1999,1

Inalmost all of its formulations; this feasibility assessment problem has been solved byexamining the schedule of a subset of task instances in a bounded interval of time. It hasbeen shown that if any deadline is missed in this interval; then any other instantiation of thesame task set is not feasibly scheduled by EDF.,*,1998,1

Verification of resource controller processes,Krithivasan Ramamritham,Abstract Shared resources and the processes that control them play a critical role in thefunctioning of concurrent systems. A shared resource is viewed as an abstract data typeconsisting of the definition of the resource and the operations on it; with additionalsynchronization constraints. Here we present a technique for verifying resource controllersusing the formalism of temporal logic. Properties of the operations on a given sharedresource are first verified. This is followed by the verification of invariant and livenessproperties of the controller. The technique is illustrated by its application to resourcecontroller tasks in Ada. As a prerequisite for accomplishing this; we specify the semantics ofAda tasking primitives.,Information Systems,1987,1

Enabling local actions by global consensus,Krithivasan Ramamritham,Abstract Presented is an algorithm for determining whether total global consensus exists fora process to execute a local action that has interaction constraints. The algorithm assumes avirtual ring of processes each of which possesses a token. Multiple processes cansimultaneously attempt and succeed in performing actions that do not constrain each other;thus exploiting the available parallelism. The algorithm can be tailored to handle anysituation in which the action of one process is constrained by actions of other processes andwhere total global consensus is required. The use of execution time estimates andinformation concerning the attempts and activities of other processes reduces the number offailed attempts and hence unnecessary communication.,Information Systems,1985,1

Of interest is the correctness of the algorithm for distributed control.Demonstrating the correctness involves showing that the algorithm guarantees theconsistency of distributed data; and equally importantly; that every transaction will eventuallyterminate. Proof of consistency is based on the notion of serializability of transactions whileproof of termination is based on the conflict resolution and failure recovery strategiesemployed by the transaction system.,Information Systems,1983,1

We use these techniques to developSolarCast; a cloud-based web service that automatically generates models that providecustomized site-specific predictions of solar generation. SolarCast utilizes a “black box”approach that requires only (1) a site's geographic location and (2) a minimal amount ofhistorical generation data.

Revisiting Selection of Residential Consumers for Demand Response Programs,Haroon Rashid; Pushpendra Singh; Krithi Ramamritham,ABSTRACT Electrical utilities depend on Demand Response programs to manage peakloads by incentivizing consumers to voluntarily curtail a portion of their load during aspecified period. Utilities first categorize consumers based on their energy consumptionpatterns into different clusters and then request consumers of a particular cluster toparticipate in the demand response program. At a coarse level; clustering approaches dowell; but we may not be able to correctly predict which cluster's profile will fit that day's poweravailability. We address this issue by examining the consistency of consumer's consumptionpatterns across several consecutive days. We demonstrate that measuring consistencyquantitatively helps to understand predictability of consumer's energy consumption.

SolarCast-an open web service for predicting solar power generation in smart homes: demo abstract,Srinivasan Iyengar; Navin Sharma; David Irwin; Prashant Shenoy; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract As the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels decreases; their use amonghomeowners is becoming increasingly popular. However; due to the intermittent anduncontrollable nature of solar power generation; there is a need for tools that helpconsumers and utilities forecast future solar generation at individual homes throughout thegrid. Thus; we present SolarCast; a open web service that provides homeowners (or utilities)access to customized predictions of their future solar generation based on their localizedweather conditions. SolarCast learns a prediction model based on each site's own historicalpower generation and weather data. Importantly; SolarCast includes programmatic APIs fordevelopers to incorporate its predictions as part of networked smart devices; eg; for utilityDemand Response programs. We view SolarCast as a useful consumer and utility tool for …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Embedded Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings,2014,*

On the Complexity of Multi-Query Optimization in Stream Grids.,Saikat Mukherjee; Srinath Srinivasa; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Stream grids are wide-area grid computing environments that are fed by a set ofstream data sources. Such grids are becoming more wide-spread due to the large scaledeployment of sensor networks for a wide range of applications; from monitoringgeophysical activities to supply chain management coupled with applications like networkmonitoring. Queries external to the system arrive on any node in the grid seeking data fromone or more data streams. The kind of queries considered in this work are (1) lifetimequeries and (2) long running queries where new query arrivals and query revocations areinfrequent. From the system perspective; computing the optimal query plan for the set ofqueries incident on the grid would ensure minimal system-wide resource usage; therebymaximizing the number of concurrent queries that can be supported.

An autonomous agent approach to query optimization in stream grids,Saikat Mukherjee; Srinath Srinivasa; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Stream grids are wide-area grid computing environments that are fed by a set ofstream data sources. Queries arrive at the grid from users and applications external to thesystem. The kind of queries considered in this work are long-running continuous (LRC)queries; that we also term as" open-world" queries. These queries are neither short-lived norinfinitely long lived. They live long enough to make the prospect of multi-query optimizationmeaningful. But queries may also terminate at any time; requiring re-optimization of thequery plans. The queries are" open" from the grid perspective as the grid cannot control orpredict:(1) arrival of a query with time; location; required data and;(2) query revocations.Query optimization in such an environment has two major challenges:(a) optimizing in amulti-query environment and (b) continuous optimization due to new query arrivals and …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems,2009,*

Efficient Techniques for Monitoring Polynomial Queries Over Dynamic Data,Shetal Shah; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Many monitoring applications involve continuous queries expressed over multipledata items whose values change rapidly and unpredictably. These queries typically involvedata from multiple sources. Given a set of continuous queries at a coordinator; we look at theproblem of assigning data accuracy bounds (tolerable imprecision) to the source for eachdata item given user-specified accuracy bounds for each query. We seek an assignmentsuch that (a) if the value of each data item is within its data accuracy bound at a coordinatorthen the value of each query is also within its accuracy bound;(b) the number of datarefreshes sent by sources to the coordinators to meet the query accuracy bounds is as lowas possible; and (c) the number of times the data accuracy bounds needs to be recomputed;due to the dynamics of the data; is low.,*,2007,*

For a user executing a transaction with a web portal from a mobile device;the disconnection will require him to redo all the steps in the transaction on subsequentreconnection. This paper proposes a recovery scheme to restore the most recent and validresponse from the previous session; so that the effort towards rework is minimized. The user;upon reconnection; can continue from the restored response without restarting from thebeginning of the transaction.

Streaming Data Dissemination Using Peer-Peer Systems,Shetal Shah; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Many characteristics of peer-peer systems make them suitable for addressing thetraditional problems of information storage and dissemination. Peer-peer systems give adistributed solution to these problems. Typically; peer-peer systems (research prototypes orcommercial systems) have dynamic topologies where peers join and leave the network atany point. However; the information that is stored and queried in these peers is assumed tobe static. Most of these current peer-peer systems do not deal with data that is changingdynamically; ie; data that changes rapidly and unpredictably. This chapter first examines afew of the existing peer-peer systems and the various issues that they address.

Using a detailed simulationmodel; the real-time performance of a representative set of classical transaction commitprotocols is evaluated. The experimental results show that data distribution has a significantinfluence on real-time performance and that the choice of commit protocol clearly affects themagnitude of this influence. We also propose and evaluate a new commit protocol; PROMPT(Permits Reading Of Modified Prepared-data for Timeliness); that is specifically designed forthe realtime domain.

Projection Signature Indexing for Compressed Data Warehouses,Akshai Mirchandani; Helen Thomas; Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamrithamy; Carlos Ordonez; Sham Navathe,Abstract The large size of most data warehouses (typically hundreds of gigabytes toterabytes); which results in non-trivial storage costs; makes compression techniquesattractive for warehousing environments. For the most part; page-level compression (asopposed to attribute or record level schemes) has been shown to achieve the greatestreductions in storage size for databases. A key issue with such schemes is how to quicklyaccess the data to answer queries; since individual tuples boundaries are lost. In this paperwe introduce an approach that aims to maintain the bene ts of page-level compression (ie;large reductions in storage size); while at the same time improving query performancethrough an e cient signature le indexing scheme. The approach uses an attribute-levelsignature generation method that exploits the value distribution of each attribute in a data …,*,1999,*

Is this a feasible proposition? In this talk; we present the results of our ongoingquest for answers to this question. The first part'of the talk discusses the limitations and real-time features of modern generalpurpose operating systems. In particular; a characterizationof Windows NT is presented from the perspective of real-time constraints. We systematicallyarrive at guidelines and recommendations that will be useful for real time system designersas they build applications using NT. The observations are validated by the use of NT for aprototype application involving real-time control that includes multimedia informationprocessing. The results of the experimental evaluation show that whereas it is neither …,Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications; 1999. RTCSA'99. Sixth International Conference on,1999,*
Learning Real-Time Strategies for Binocular Vergence,Justus Piater Krithi; Justus Piater; Krithi Ramamritham; Roderic Grupen,Abstract This report presents a method for learning real-time strategies to verge a stereo pairof cameras such that their image centers display the same world feature. The method makesuse of a foveal image representation in which image resolution decreases logarithmicallyfrom the center towards the periphery. This representation performs a significant image datareduction that reduces the computational cost of stereo matching; and is easily computed atframe rate on a standard PC platform. The algorithm is applied to vergence control in a 2-DOF stereo pair. The resulting vergence controller is envisioned as one of several controloptions available for generic; sensorimotor problem solving. These options compete forresources and are therefore subject to a scheduler. The scheduler has access to a-prioriperformance estimates as a function of the compute time available. For this setting; a Q …,University of Massachusetts,1999,*
Query result caching in data warehouses and data marts,Prasan Roy; Jinesh Vora; Krithi Ramamritham; S Seshadri; S Sudarshan,Abstract In data warehouse and data mart systems; queries often take a long time to executedue to their complex nature. A single user may submit a sequence of related queries; andqueries submitted by dierent users may also have commonalities. Query response times canbe greatly improved by caching nal/intermediate results of previous queries; and using themto answer later queries. Further; in a distributed environment; caching query results locallycan also reduce communication time. In this paper we describe a caching middlewaresystem; which provides both the above functionalities. It can be used in centralizedwarehouse settings; as well as in distributed data mart settings. The system incorporatesseveral novel features; revolving around a tight coupling of the query optimizer and thecache manager. In particular; the tight coupling allows us to implement better cache …,*,1999,*

EDF Scheduling for Shared Resources,John A Stankovic; Marco Spuri; Krithi Ramamritham; Giorgio C Buttazzo,Abstract Most scheduling algorithms are primarily concerned with cpu scheduling. Whenjobs are allowed to access shared resources; the accesses need to be controlled; as in anyconcurrent system; through the use of appropriate protocols to ensure the integrity of theresources despite potential concurrent access. The problem of accessing shared resourcesis well known and there is a vast literature that discusses solutions to this problem (see [8; 9;17] for a general treatment). Solutions for the shared resource access problem usually adoptsome form of semaphores [5]; critical sections [2]; or monitors [6].,*,1998,*
Distributed Scheduling—Part II,John A Stankovic; Marco Spuri; Krithi Ramamritham; Giorgio C Buttazzo,Abstract The algorithms and analysis of distributed real-time scheduling presented inChapter 9 assumes a fairly simple task set model. As a result; formulas for analysis of thesesystems can be derived. In this Chapter; two real-time scheduling algorithms are presentedwhere the task set model is more complex and no such formulas exist. The first algorithmhandles static real-time distributed scheduling where tasks have deadlines; periods;precedence; communication; and even replication requirements. The algorithm is easilymodified so that it can be used for many static; distributed real-time systems. The secondalgorithm is appropriate for dynamic distributed real-time systems; but only for the non-critical tasks. This algorithm is based on a combination of focussed addressing and bidding.The current state of the art is rather primitive in dynamic distributed real-time systems.,*,1998,*
Precedence Constraints and Shared Resources,John A Stankovic; Marco Spuri; Krithi Ramamritham; Giorgio C Buttazzo,Abstract In many hard real-time systems; due to the strict deadlines that must be met;communications among jobs are implemented in a completely deterministic manner. Oneapproach used is to model communication requirements as precedence constraints amongjobs; that is; if a job J i has to communicate the result of its computation to another job J j; thepair (J i; J j) is introduced in a partial order≺; and the jobs are scheduled in such a way that ifJ i≺ J j the execution of J i precedes the execution of J j.,*,1998,*

Issues in achieving temporal and semantic coherency in distributed real-time applications,Krithi Ramamritham,Modern information-intensive applications require timely access to temporally accurate data.This demands the collection; integration and processing of temporally-coherent data and itsdisplay in a" continuous" fashion. When utilizing several pieces of information; each must befresh relative to the use of that information-and together; they must be relatively consistent.The techniques used must ensure temporal coherency among the data being integrated.When information from multiple media must be processed and presented; the quality of thefinal information must" make sense". This leads to semantic coherency requirements.Techniques must support the processing of such data under strict timing concerns too.Timeliness is an important QoS (quality of service) parameter.

Scheduling of Pipelined Periodic Tasks in Distributed Real-Time Systems,G Fohler; K Ramamritham,Abstract Many distributed real-time applications involve periodic activities with end-to-endtiming constraints that are larger than the periods. That is; a new instance of a periodicactivity will come into existence before the previous instance has been completed. Also;such activities typically involve communicating modules in a distributed system where somemodules may be replicated for resilience. For such activities; pipelined execution allows usto meet the various resource and timing constraints imposed on them. In this paper; wediscuss an approach to dealing with the pipelined execution of a set of periodic activities thathave the above characteristics. It can be called a {\em meta-algorithm} since it works inconjunction with another scheduling algorithm--one that creates the actual schedules.

Efficiently Rewriting Histor: An Implementation of Transaction Delegation,C Pedregal Martin; K Ramamritham,Abstract The notion of transaction delegation; as introduced in ACTA; has been shown to beuseful in synthesizing Extended Transaction Models. Delegation allows a transaction totransfer responsibility over an object; and its operations; to another transaction. Delegationcan be used to broaden the visibility of the delegatee; and to tailor the recovery properties ofa transaction model. The broadening of visibility is useful in allowing a delegator toselectively make tentative and partial results; as well as hints such as coordinationinformation; accessible to other transactions. The control of the recovery makes it possible todecouple the fate of an update from that of the transaction that made the updates; forinstance; a transaction may delegate some operations that will remain uncommitted but validafter the delegator transaction aborted.

Recovery Protocols for Cache-Coherent Shared Memory Operating Systems,Lory D Molesky; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Significant performance advantages can be achieved by implementing certainkernel data structures in the cache-coherent memory of a shared memory multiprocessor.However; even in multiprocessor systems which are capable of detecting and isolating nodefailures; implementing kernel data structures in shared memory can cause recoveryproblems. For example; in the disk buffer; when disk blocks are buffered in cache-coherentmemory; unnecessary dependencies may form between processes which access thesebuffers. Because of these dependencies; the crash of one node may adversely affect theintegrity of processes which execute on nodes other than the one (s) which failed; violatingthe forward progress of these processes. Moreover; resources held by processes running oncrashed nodes may fail to be released; violating system liveness properties. In this paper …,*,1994,*

Dependable Real-Time Systems,Krithi Ramamritham; John A Stankovic; Victor Yodaiken,Abstract: Most current real-time operating systems contain the same basic paradigms foundin timesharing operating systems and are simply stripped down and optimized versions oftimesharing operating systems. For example; while they stress fast mechanisms such as afast context switch and the ability to respond to external interrupts quickly; they retain themain abstractions of timesharing operating systems. In addition; very often today's real-timekernels use priority scheduling. Priority scheduling is a mechanism which provides no directsupport for meeting timing constraints. For example; the current technology burdens thedesigner with unenviable task of mapping a set of specific constraints on task executionsinto task priorities in such a manner that all tasks will meet their deadlines. Thus; when usingthe current paradigms together with priority scheduling it is difficult to predict how tasks …,*,1991,*

Reservation Approach to Real-Time Communication Services,K Arvind; K Ramamritham; JA Stankovic,Abstract We examine an important shortcoming; viz.; pessimism; of the various protocols thatwe have looked at so far for supporting real-time virtual circuit services. We identify the lackof global knowledge in these protocols as a cause for their pessimism. We then look atseveral reservation-based protocols to see whether any of these protocols can be used toovercome this shortcoming. The class of explicit reservation-based protocols make use ofglobal knowledge in order to schedule messages on the channel. However; these protocolshave a major drawback; viz.; they may lose scheduling synchronization in the presence ofnoise. Since loss of scheduling synchronization could result in the violation of guarantees;these protocols require special fault-tolerance mechanisms for implementing guarantee-based services.,*,1990,*

Resource controller tasks in ADA: Their structure and semantics,Krithivasan Ramamritham,Abstract The focus of this paper is on the processes that control access to shared resourcesin concurrent systems. Processes that access a shared resource send access requests tothe controller of the shared resource which in turn services requests based on such criteriaas the conditions enabling the requests; the fairness specified; etc. In this paper we examinethe structure of resource controllers; in particular; we show how resource controllersmanifest themselves in Ada. Our prime motivation for this work is to develop schemes bywhich controllers with complex resource control policies can be implemented using thetasking constructs of Ada. To enable the verification of Ada resource controllers; we providea temporal semantics for the tasking constructs as well as for the resource controllercomponents.,Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Software engineering,1984,*

Specifying and Proving Properties of Sentinels,Krithivasan Ramamritham; Robert M Keller,Abstract This paper presents a technique for specifying and verifying properties of"sentinels;" a high-level language construct for synchronizing access to shared resources.Statements in the specification language possess formal temporal semantics. As a preludeto proving the correctness of sentinels; the semantics of constructs used in sentinels is given.The proof technique involves showing that the temporal behavior of a sentinel conforms tothat defined by the specification. The methodology is illustrated by applying it to a typicalsynchronization problem.,*,1981,*
Message from the Symposium Chairs,Ted Baker; Wei Zhao,Since the early~ O'S; we have witnessed increasing interest in real-time technology; as aresult of growing needs for scientific solutions to problems involving time-constrainedinformation processing in various applications such as avionics; multimedia; robotics;automated process control; and manufacturing. Founded by Andre M. van Tilborg in 1983;the IEEE Workshop on Real-Time Operating Systems and Software (RTOSS) has been animportant annual forum for exchanging information about emerging principles and practicesin this area. Over the twelve years since RTOSS's founding; the the real-time technologybase has expanded significantly; as has the number of researchers tackling the manychallenging problems that remain. To better serve this growing community; the IEEETechnical Committee on Real-Time Systems decided to expand RTOSS into this …,Proceedings of the Real-Time Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS’95),1812,*

Curio: A Novel Solution for E cient Storage and Indexing in Data Warehouses,Anindya Datta; Krithi Ramamrithamy; Helen Thomas,Abstract E cient query processing is a critical requirement for data warehousing systems asdecision support applications often require interactive response times to answer complex;ad-hoc queries (eg; aggregations; multi-way joins) over vast repositories of data (eg;hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size). The most common approach used to improve On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) query performance is to utilize indexes or accessstructures to quickly access the base data. A major drawback to this approach is that it oftenincurs signi cant overhead as the access structures must be stored in addition to the basedata. In this paper; we present Curio; a data repository and OLAP query server; whichprovides drastically improved performance for ad-hoc queries; while simultaneouslyreducing the storage costs associated with warehousing.

User Level Scheduling of Communicating Real-Time Tasks,Krithi Ramamrithamy; Ichiro Mizunuma; Hyogo Amagasaki,Abstract Unique challenges are present when one tries to build distributed real-timeapplications using standard o-the-shelf systems which are in common use but are notnecessarily designed speci cally for real-time systems. In particular; to realize end-to-endpredictability when; say; a process on one node sends data to a process on another node;several issues must be addressed:(1) mapping application real-time requirements intorequirements imposed on the system schedulable entities (tasks);(2) ensuring predictableexecution of the tasks in the face of possible priority inversions; limited OS level real-timescheduling support; and limited number of priorities; and (3) integrating real-time and non-real-time tasks in the same platform. In this paper; we propose solutions to these challenges.In particular; we present user-level scheduling schemes for communicating tasks. These …,*,*,*

Enabling Real Time Analytics over Raw XML Data,Manoj K Agarwal; Krithi Ramamritham; Prashant Agarwal,Abstract. The data generated by many applications is in semi structured format; such asXML. This data can be used for analytics only after shredding and storing it in structuredformat. This process is known as Extract-Transform-Load or ETL. However; ETL process isoften time consuming due to which crucial time-sensitive insights can be lost or they maybecome un-actionable. Hence; this paper poses the following question: How do we exposeanalytical insights in the raw XML data? We address this novel problem by discoveringadditional information from the raw semi-structured data repository; called complementaryinformation (CI); for a given user query. Experiments with real as well as synthetic data showthat the discovered CI is relevant in the context of the given user query; nontrivial; and hashigh precision. The recall is also found to be high for most queries. Crowd-sourced …,*,*,*

Technical Report: Ratio Threshold Queries over Distributed Data Sources,Rajeev Gupta; Krithi Ramamritham; Mukesh Mohania,ABSTRACT Continuous aggregation queries over dynamic data are used for real timedecision making and timely business intelligence. In this paper we consider queries where aclient wants to be notified if the ratio of two aggregates over distributed data crosses aspecified threshold. Consider these scenarios: a mechanism designed to defend againstdistributed denial of service attacks may be triggered when the fraction of packets arriving toa subnet is more than 5% of the total packets; or a distributed store chain withdraws itsdiscount on luxury goods when sales of luxury goods constitute more than 20% of theoverall sales. The challenge in executing such ratio threshold queries (RTQs) lies inincurring the minimal amount of communication necessary for propagation of updates fromdata sources to the aggregator node where the client query is executed.

Real-Time Data Services for Automotive Applications,Gurulingesh Raravi; Krithi Ramamritham; Neera Sharma,Abstract In the recent years; the amount of data that needs to be sensed; stored andprocessed has increased significantly in an automobile with the rapid growth of electronicsand control software applications. The number of microprocessors required to implementthese applications have also gone up significantly. These applications deal with safety-enhancing vehicle functions and hence with critical data having stringent requirements onfreshness and involving deadline bound computations. Therefore; there is a need foreffective real-time data services to handle the data without affecting the performance andsafety of these applications and also minimizing the computational resource requirements.Using computational resources efficiently is very important which helps in reducing theadditional cost of the car manufacturer incurred due to electronics and control software …,*,*,*
Towards Intelligent Vehicles: Automatic Merge Control,Gurulingesh Raravi; Jatin Bharadia; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract There is an increased concern towards the design and development of computer-controlled automotive applications to improve safety; reduce accidents; increase traffic flow;and enhance comfort for drivers. Automakers are trying to make vehicles more intelligent byembedding processors which can be used to implement Electronic and Control Software(ECS) for taking smart decisions on the road or assisting the driver in doing the same. TheseECS applications are high-integrity; distributed and real-time in nature. Inter-VehicleCommunication and Road-Vehicle Communication will only add to this intelligence byproviding platform for distributed control implementation. Our work studies one suchapplication; namely Automatic Merge Control System; which ensures safe vehicle maneuverin the region where two roads intersect. We have formulated this problem as an …,*,*,*
Adaptive Coherency Maintenance Techniques for Time-Varying Data,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Often; data used in on-line decision making (for example; in determining how toreact to changes in process behavior; traffic flow control; etc.) is dynamic in nature andhence the timeliness of the data delivered to the decision making process becomes veryimportant. The delivered data must conform to certain time or value based applicationspecific inconsistency bounds. A system designed to disseminate dynamic data can exploituser-specified coherency requirements by fetching and disseminating only those changesthat are of interest to users and ignoring intermediate changes. But; the design ofmechanisms for such data delivery is challenging given that dynamic data changes rapidlyand unpredictably; the latter making it very hard to use simple prediction techniques. In thispaper; we address these challenges. Specifically; we develop mechanisms to obtain …,*,*,*

Monitoring the Dynamic Web to respond to Continuous Queries: A Demonstration,Sandeep Pandey; Krithi Ramamritham; Soumen Chakrabarti,ABSTRACT Our Continuous Adaptive Monitoring (CAM) system provides responses forcontinuous queries by monitoring and extracting information scattered across the web.Continuous queries are the queries for which responses given to users must becontinuously updated; as the sources of interest get updated. Such queries occur; forinstance; during on-line decision making; eg; traffic flow control; weather monitoring etc.Whereas push-based techniques may be able to refresh query results meeting userrequirements; they do not scale well. With the pull based approach; the problem of keepingthe responses current reduces to the problem of deciding how often to visit a source todetermine if and how it has been modified so that a user response can be updatedaccordingly. As should be evident; periodical monitoring is not scalable. Also; it can lead …,*,*,*
ReDAL: An Efficient and Practical Request Distribution Technique for the Application Layer,Kaushik Dutta; Anindya Datta; Debra VanderMeer; Helen Thomas; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract Modern web-based application infrastructures are based on clustered; multi-tieredarchitectures; where request distribution occurs in two sequential stages: over a cluster ofweb servers; and over a cluster of application servers. Much work has focused on strategiesfor distributing requests across a web server cluster in order to improve overall throughputacross the cluster. The strategies applied at the application layer are the same as those atthe web server layer; because it is assumed that they transfer directly. In this paper; weargue that the problem of distributing requests across an application server cluster isfundamentally different from the web server request distribution problem; due to coredifferences in request processing in web and application servers. We devise an approachfor distributing requests across a cluster of application servers such that overall system …,*,*,*

Advances in computing and communication technologies have resulted in a widevariety of networked mobile devices that access data over the Internet. In this paper; weargue that servers by themselves may not be able to handle this diversity in clientcharacteristics and so intermediaries; such as proxies; should be employed to handle themismatch between the server-supplied data and the client capabilities. Since existingproxies are primarily designed to handle traditional wired hosts; such proxy architectures willneed to be enhanced to handle mobile devices. We propose such an enhanced proxyarchitecture that is capable of handling the heterogeneity in client needs—specifically thevariations in client bandwidth and display capabilities.

Tracking Dynamic Fronts using Sensor Network,Subhasri Duttagupta; Krithi Ramamritham; Purushottam Kulkarni,Abstract—We examine the problem of tracking dynamic boundaries occurring in naturalphenomena using a network of range sensors. Two main challenges of the boundarytracking problem are accurate boundary estimation from noisy observations and continuoustracking of the boundary. We propose Dynamic Boundary Tacking (DBTR); an algorithm thatcombines the spatial estimation and temporal estimation techniques to effectively track adynamic boundary. The regression-based spatial estimation technique determines discretepoints on the boundary and estimates a confidence band around the entire boundary. Inaddition; a Kalman Filter-based temporal estimation technique tracks changes in theboundary and aperiodically updates the spatial estimation to meet accuracy requirements.DBTR; provides a low communication overhead solution to track boundaries without …,*,*,*

Efficient Execution of Continuous Aggregate Queries over Multi-Source Streaming Data,Hrishikesh Gupta; Manish Bhide; Krithi Ramamritham; Prashant Shenoy,Abstract—On-line decision making often involves query pro-cessing over time-varying datawhich arrives in the form of data streams from distributed locations. Examples of time-varyingdata include financial information such as stock prices and currency exchange rates; real-time traffic; weather information and data from process control applications. In suchenvironments; typically a decision is made whenever some function of the current value of aset of data items satisfies a threshold criterion. For example; when the traffic entering ahighway exceeds a prespecified limit; some flow control measure is initiated; when the valueof a stock portfolio goes below a comfort level; an investor might decide to rethink hisportfolio management strategy. In this paper we present data dissemination and queryprocessing techniques where such queries access data from multiple sources. Key …,*,*,*

New Algorithms for Resource Reclaiming from Precedence Constrained Tasks in Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems,G Manimaran C Siva Ram Murthy; Machiraju Vijayy; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract The scheduling of tasks in multiprocessor real-time systems has attracted manyresearchers in the recent past. Tasks in these systems have deadlines to be met; and mostof the real-time scheduling algorithms use worst case computation times to schedule thesetasks. Many resources will be left unused if the tasks are dispatched purely based on theschedule produced by these scheduling algorithms; since most of the tasks will take lessertime to execute than their respective worst case computation times. Resource reclaimingrefers to the problem of reclaiming the resources left unused by a real-time task when ittakes lesser time to execute than its worst case computation time. In this paper; we proposetwo algorithms to reclaim these resources from real-time tasks that are constrained byprecedence relations and resource requirements; in shared memory multiprocessor …,*,*,*

Context-aware Timely Information Delivery in Mobile Environments,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In mobile environments transmitting information relevant to an event along withnotification of the event has been proven to be an effective means of providing revenueenhancing services. For example; a relevant advertisement can be displayed just beforeevent notification; for instance; a product promotion by Beckham can be shown just beforethe notification of a goal scored by him. Challenges in achieving real time search anddelivery of information relevant to events as they occur include:(a) Predicting the next eventso that the appropriate information can be kept ready;(b) Finding information relevant to thecontext and content of the event;(c) Searching and bringing the potentially neededinformation closer to the user location; and (d) Disseminating and displaying relevantinformation just before the actual event is notified to the user.

Such architectures are part of anincreasing number of emerging applications in wireless mobile computing systems; theyalso provide a scalable means to deliver information in web-based applications; for examplein publish-subscribe systems.

Implications of Proxy Caching for Provisioning Networks and Servers,Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In this paper; we examine the potential benefits of web proxy caches in improvingthe effective capacity of servers and networks. Since networks and servers are typicallyprovisioned based on a high percentile of the load; we focus on the effects of proxy cachingon the tail of the load distribution. We find that; unlike their substantial impact on the averageload; proxies have a diminished impact on the tail of the load distribution. The exactreduction in the tail and the corresponding capacity savings depend on the nature of theworkload and the percentile of the load distribution chosen for provisioning networks andservers—the higher the percentile; the smaller the savings.
