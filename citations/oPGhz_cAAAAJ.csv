Energy management for mapreduce clusters,Willis Lang; Jignesh M Patel,Abstract The area of cluster-level energy management has attracted significant researchattention over the past few years. One class of techniques to reduce the energy consumptionof clusters is to selectively power down nodes during periods of low utilization to increaseenergy efficiency. One can think of a number of ways of selectively powering down nodes;each with varying impact on the workload response time and overall energy consumption.Since the MapReduce framework is becoming" ubiquitous"; the focus of this paper is ondeveloping a framework for systematically considering various MapReduce node powerdown strategies; and their impact on the overall energy consumption and workloadresponse time. We closely examine two extreme techniques that can be accommodated inthis framework. The first is based on a recently proposed technique called" Covering Set" …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,230
Towards eco-friendly database management systems,Willis Lang; Jignesh Patel,Abstract: Database management systems (DBMSs) have largely ignored the task ofmanaging the energy consumed during query processing. Both economical andenvironmental factors now require that DBMSs pay close attention to energy consumption. Inthis paper we approach this issue by considering energy consumption as a first-classperformance goal for query processing in a DBMS. We present two concrete techniques thatcan be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy consumption. Both techniques tradeenergy consumption for performance. The first technique; called PVC; leverages the abilityof modern processors to execute at lower processor voltage and frequency. The secondtechnique; called QED; uses query aggregation to leverage common components of queriesin a workload. Using experiments run on a commercial DBMS and MySQL; we show that …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1767,2009,92
Towards multi-tenant performance SLOs,Willis Lang; Srinath Shankar; Jignesh M Patel; Ajay Kalhan,As traditional and mission-critical relational database workloads migrate to the cloud in theform of Database-as-a-Service (DaaS); there is an increasing motivation to provideperformance goals in Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Providing such performance goals ischallenging for DaaS providers as they must balance the performance that they can deliverto tenants and the data center's operating costs. In general; aggressively aggregatingtenants on each server reduces the operating costs but degrades performance for thetenants; and vice versa. In this paper; we present a framework that takes as input the tenantworkloads; their performance SLOs; and the server hardware that is available to the DaaSprovider; and outputs a cost-effective recipe that specifies how much hardware to provisionand how to schedule the tenants on each hardware resource. We evaluate our method …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,83
Wimpy node clusters: What about non-wimpy workloads?,Willis Lang; Jignesh M Patel; Srinath Shankar,Abstract The high cost associated with powering servers has introduced new challenges inimproving the energy efficiency of clusters running data processing jobs. Traditional high-performance servers are largely energy inefficient due to various factors such as the over-provisioning of resources. The increasing trend to replace traditional high-performanceserver nodes with low-power low-end nodes in clusters has recently been touted as asolution to the cluster energy problem. However; the key tacit assumption that drives such asolution is that the proportional scale-out of such low-power cluster nodes results in constantscaleup in performance. This paper studies the validity of such an assumption usingmeasured price and performance results from a low-power Atom-based node and atraditional Xeon-based server and a number of published parallel scaleup results.

On energy management; load balancing and replication,Willis Lang; Jignesh M Patel; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract In this paper we investigate some opportunities and challenges that arise in energy-aware computing in a cluster of servers running data-intensive workloads. We leverage theinsight that servers in a cluster are often underutilized; which makes it attractive to considerpowering down some servers and redistributing their load to others. Of course; poweringdown servers naively will render data stored only on powered down servers inaccessible.While data replication can be exploited to power down servers without losing access to data;unfortunately; care must be taken in the design of the replication and server power downschemes to avoid creating load imbalances on the remaining" live" servers. Accordingly; inthis paper we study the interaction between energy management; load balancing; andreplication strategies for data-intensive cluster computing. In particular; we show that …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,61
Rethinking query processing for energy efficiency: Slowing down to win the race.,Willis Lang; Ramakrishnan Kandhan; Jignesh M Patel,Abstract The biggest change in the TPC benchmarks in over two decades is now wellunderway–namely the addition of an energy efficiency metric along with traditionalperformance metrics. This change is fueled by the growing; real; and urgent demand forenergy-efficient database processing. Database query processing engines must nowconsider becoming energy-aware; else they risk missing many opportunities for significantenergy savings. While other recent work has focused on solely optimizing for energyefficiency; we recognize that such methods are only practical if they also considerperformance requirements specified in SLAs. The focus of this paper is on the design andevaluation of a general framework for query optimization that considers both performanceconstraints and energy consumption as first-class optimization criteria.

Towards energy-efficient database cluster design,Willis Lang; Stavros Harizopoulos; Jignesh M Patel; Mehul A Shah; Dimitris Tsirogiannis,Abstract Energy is a growing component of the operational cost for many" big data"deployments; and hence has become increasingly important for practitioners of large-scaledata analysis who require scale-out clusters or parallel DBMS appliances. Although anumber of recent studies have investigated the energy efficiency of DBMSs; none of thesestudies have looked at the architectural design space of energy-efficient parallel DBMSclusters. There are many challenges to increasing the energy efficiency of a DBMS cluster;including dealing with the inherent scaling inefficiency of parallel data processing; andchoosing the appropriate energy-efficient hardware. In this paper; we experimentallyexamine and analyze a number of key parameters related to these challenges for designingenergy-efficient database clusters.

Dictionary-based compression for long time-series similarity,Willis Lang; Michael Morse; Jignesh M Patel,Long time-series data sets are common in many domains; especially scientific domains.Applications in these fields often require comparing trajectories using similarity measures.Existing methods perform well for short time series but their evaluation cost degrades rapidlyfor longer time series. In this work; we develop a new time-series similarity measure calledthe Dictionary Compression Score (DCS) for determining time-series similarity. We alsoshow that this method allows us to accurately and quickly calculate similarity for both shortand long time series. We use the well-known Kolmogorov Complexity in information theoryand the Lempel-Ziv compression framework as a basis to calculate similarity scores. Weshow that off-the-shelf compressors do not fair well for computing time-series similarity. Toaddress this problem; we developed a novel dictionary-based compression technique to …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2010,24
When free is not really free: What does it cost to run a database workload in the cloud?,Avrilia Floratou; Jignesh M Patel; Willis Lang; Alan Halverson,Abstract The current computing trend towards cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DaaS)as an alternative to traditional on-site relational database management systems (RDBMSs)has largely been driven by the perceived simplicity and cost-effectiveness of migrating to aDaaS. However; customers that are attracted to these DaaS alternatives may find that therange of different services and pricing options available to them add an unexpected level ofcomplexity to their decision making. Cloud service pricing models are typically 'pay-as-you-go'in which the customer is charged based on resource usage such as CPU and memoryutilization. Thus; customers considering different DaaS options must take into account howthe performance and efficiency of the DaaS will ultimately impact their monthly bill. In thispaper; we show that the current DaaS model can produce unpleasant surprises–for …,Technology Conference on Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking,2011,20
Scalable rule-based gene expression data classification,Mark A Iwen; Willis Lang; Jignesh M Patel,Current state-of-the-art association rule-based classifiers for gene expression data operatein two phases:(i) Association rule mining from training data followed by (ii) Classification ofquery data using the mined rules. In the worst case; these methods require an exponentialsearch over the subset space of the training data set's samples and/or genes during at leastone of these two phases. Hence; existing association rule-based techniques areprohibitively computationally expensive on large gene expression datasets. Our main resultis the development of a heuristic rule-based gene expression data classifier called BooleanStructure Table Classification (BSTC). BSTC is explicitly related to association rule-basedmethods; but is guaranteed to be polynomial space/time.

Partial results in database systems,Willis Lang; Rimma V Nehme; Eric Robinson; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract As the size and complexity of analytic data processing systems continue to grow;the effort required to mitigate faults and performance skew has also risen. However; in someenvironments we have encountered; users prefer to continue query execution even in thepresence of failures (eg; the unavailability of certain data sources); and receive a" partial"answer to their query. We explore ways to characterize and classify these partial results; anddescribe an analytical framework that allows the system to perform coarse to fine-grainedanalysis to determine the semantics of a partial result. We propose that if the system isequipped with such a framework; in some cases it is better to return and explain partialresults than to attempt to avoid them.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,13
Periscope/SQ: interactive exploration of biological sequence databases,Sandeep Tata; Willis Lang; Jignesh M Patel,Abstract Life science laboratories today have to rely on procedural techniques to store andmanage large sequence datasets. Procedural techniques are cumbersome to use and areoften very inefficient compared to optimized declarative techniques. We have designed andimplemented a system called Periscope/SQ that makes it possible to rapidly expresscomplex queries within a declarative framework and take advantage of database-style queryoptimization. As a result; queries in Periscope/SQ run orders of magnitude faster than typicalprocedural implementations. We demonstrate the power of Persicope/SQ through anapplication called Gene-Locator which allows biologists to rapidly explore large genomicsequence databases.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,13
Microsoft azure SQL database telemetry,Willis Lang; Frank Bertsch; David J DeWitt; Nigel Ellis,Abstract Microsoft operates the Azure SQL Database (ASD) cloud service; one of thedominant relational cloud database services in the market today. To aid the academiccommunity in their research on designing and efficiently operating cloud database services;Microsoft is introducing the release of production-level telemetry traces from the ASDservice. This telemetry data set provides; over a wide set of important hardware resourcesand counters; the consumption level of each customer database replica.

STeP: Scalable Tenant Placement for Managing Database-as-a-Service Deployments,Rebecca Taft; Willis Lang; Jennie Duggan; Aaron J Elmore; Michael Stonebraker; David DeWitt,Abstract Public cloud providers with Database-as-a-Service offerings must efficientlyallocate computing resources to each of their customers. An effective assignment of tenantsboth reduces the number of physical servers in use and meets customer expectations at aprice point that is competitive in the cloud market. For public cloud vendors like Microsoftand Amazon; this means packing millions of users' databases onto hundreds or thousandsof servers. This paper studies tenant placement by examining a publicly released dataset ofanonymized customer resource usage statistics from Microsoft's Azure SQL Databaseproduction system over a three-month period. We implemented the STeP framework toingest and analyze this large dataset. STeP allowed us to use this production dataset toevaluate several new algorithms for packing database tenants onto servers.

Database Optimization in the Cloud: Where Costs; Partial Results; and Consumer Choice Meet.,Willis Lang; Rimma V Nehme; Ian Rae,ABSTRACT Database services in the cloud (DBaaS) allow users to convert the fixed costs ofdeploying and maintaining a database system to variable costs that are incurred in a pay-as-you-go manner. Considerable research focus has been given to the cost of the elasticity (ofperformance) and reliability of a DBaaS. This is because in the cloud; users are able tomodulate these characteristics of a DBaaS by paying more or less to the provider. However;the one invariant has always been that the user will receive a complete and correct result. Inthis paper we consider another possibility; that users may be willing to accept differentquality results from a DBaaS that aren't complete and correct if the price is right. Recently;there has been research classifying “partial results” produced using incomplete input (due tofailures) while processing a query. These classifications provide a broad and general way …,CIDR,2015,3
Not for the Timid: On the Impact of Aggressive Over-booking in the Cloud,Willis Lang; Karthik Ramachandra; David J DeWitt; Shize Xu; Qun Guo; Ajay Kalhan; Peter Carlin,Abstract To lower hosting costs and service prices; database-as-a-service (DBaaS)providers strive to maximize cluster utilization without negatively affecting their users' serviceexperience. Some of the most effective approaches for increasing service efficiency result inthe over-booking of the cluster with user databases. For instance; one approach is to reclaimcluster capacity from a database when it is idle; temporarily re-using the capacity for someother purpose; and over-booking the cluster's resources. Such approaches are largelydriven by policies that determine when it is prudent to temporarily reclaim capacity from anidle database. In this paper; we examine policies that inherently tune the system's idlesensitivity. Increased sensitivity to idleness leads to aggressive over-booking while theconverse leads to conservative reclamation and lower utilization levels.

Predictive Provisioning: Efficiently Anticipating Usage in Azure SQL Database,Lalitha Viswanathan; Bikash Chandra; Willis Lang; Karthik Ramachandra; Jignesh M Patel; Ajay Kalhan; David J DeWitt; Alan Halverson,Over-booking cloud resources is an effective way to increase the cost efficiency of a cluster;and is being studied within Microsoft for the Azure SQL Database service. A key challenge isto strike the right balance between the potentially conflicting goals of optimizing for resourceallocation efficiency and positive user experience. Understanding when cloud databasecustomers use their database instances and when they are idle can allow one tosuccessfully balance these two metrics. In our work; we formulate and evaluate production-feasible methods to develop idleness profiles for customer databases. Using one of thelargest data center telemetry datasets; namely Azure SQL Database telemetry acrossmultiple data centers; we show that our schemes are effective in predicting future patterns ofdatabase usage.

m-tables: Representing missing data,Bruhathi Sundarmurthy; Paraschos Koutris; Willis Lang; Jeffrey Naughton; Val Tannen,Abstract Representation systems have been widely used to capture different forms ofincomplete data in various settings. However; existing representation systems are notexpressive enough to handle the more complex scenarios of missing data that can occur inpractice: these could vary from missing attribute values; missing a known number of tuples;or even missing an unknown number of tuples. In this work; we propose a newrepresentation system called m-tables; that can represent many different types of missingdata. We show that m-tables form a closed; complete and strong representation systemunder both set and bag semantics and are strictly more expressive than conditional tablesunder both the closed and open world assumptions. We further study the complexity ofcomputing certain and possible answers in m-tables. Finally; we discuss how to" interpret" …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2017,1

Per-node custom code engine for distributed query processing,*,Distributed query processing is often performed by a set of nodes that apply MapReduce toa data set and materialize partial results to storage; which are then aggregated to producethe query result. However; this architecture requires a preconfigured set of database nodes;can only fulfill queries that utilize MapReduce processing; and may be slowed down bymaterializing partial results to storage. Instead; distributed query processing can beachieved by choosing a node for various portions of the query; and generating customizedcode for the node that only performs the query portion that is allocated to the node. The nodeexecutes the code to perform the query portion; and rather than materializing partial resultsto storage; streams intermediate query results to a next selected node in the distributedquery.

A Novel Approach for Bulk Motif Matching Using Suffix Trees,Willis Lang; Nate Derbinsky,Methods 398 PWM's were obtained from the Transfac 7.0 Public database of eukaryotictranscription factors. Other factor databases; such as Jaspar; are of interest but; due toconstraints of time; will be put off for later study. Approximately 40;000 gene sequences(human and mouse genomes) were obtained from NCBI. A naïve method of solving thisproblem is to apply the PWM's one character at a time down a sequence. For each position(window) of the sequence; the PWM derived value is calculated. If the score passes a usergiven threshold; the sequence is noted to pass this PWM. Obviously; this naïve method is themost brute force method possible. An immediate observation is that the PWM calculation oneach window can be preemptively cut short if the score calculated on the window thus farhas no possible chance of meeting the threshold.
