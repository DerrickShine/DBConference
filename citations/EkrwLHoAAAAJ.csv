Effects of electrostatic screening on the conformation of single DNA molecules confined in a nanochannel,Ce Zhang; Fang Zhang; Jeroen A van Kan; Johan RC Van der Maarel,Single T4-DNA molecules were confined in rectangular-shaped channels with a depth of300 nm and a width in the range of 150–300 nm casted in a poly (dimethylsiloxane)nanofluidic chip. The extensions of the DNA molecules were measured with fluorescencemicroscopy as a function of the ionic strength and composition of the buffer as well as theDNA intercalation level by the YOYO-1 dye. The data were interpreted with the scalingtheory for a wormlike polymer in good solvent; including the effects of confinement; charge;and self-avoidance. It was found that the elongation of the DNA molecules with decreasingionic strength can be interpreted in terms of an increase of the persistence length. Self-avoidance effects on the extension are moderate; due to the small correlation lengthimposed by the channel cross-sectional diameter. Intercalation of the dye results in an …,The Journal of chemical physics,2008,93
Macromolecular crowding induced elongation and compaction of single DNA molecules confined in a nanochannel,Ce Zhang; Pei Ge Shao; Jeroen A Van Kan; Johan RC Van Der Maarel,Abstract The effect of dextran nanoparticles on the conformation and compaction of singleDNA molecules confined in a nanochannel was investigated with fluorescence microscopy.It was observed that the DNA molecules elongate and eventually condense into a compactform with increasing volume fraction of the crowding agent. Under crowded conditions; thechannel diameter is effectively reduced; which is interpreted in terms of depletion in DNAsegment density in the interfacial region next to the channel wall. Confinement in ananochannel also facilitates compaction with a neutral crowding agent at low ionic strength.The threshold volume fraction for condensation is proportional to the size of thenanoparticle; due to depletion induced attraction between DNA segments. We found that theeffect of crowding is not only related to the colligative properties of the agent and that …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2009,76
High throughput fabrication of disposable nanofluidic lab-on-chip devices for single molecule studies,Jeroen A van Kan; Ce Zhang; Piravi Perumal Malar; Johan RC van der Maarel,An easy method is introduced allowing fast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replication ofnanofluidic lab-on-chip devices using accurately fabricated molds featuring cross-sectionsdown to 60 nm. A high quality master is obtained through proton beam writing and UVlithography. This master can be used more than 200 times to replicate nanofluidic devicescapable of handling single DNA molecules. This method allows to fabricate nanofluidicdevices through simple PDMS casting. The extensions of YOYO-1 stained bacteriophage T4and λ− DNA inside these nanochannels have been investigated using fluorescencemicroscopy and follow the scaling prediction of a large; locally coiled polymer chainconfined in nanochannels.,Biomicrofluidics,2012,36
MRP14 (S100A9) Protein Interacts with Alzheimer Beta-Amyloid Peptide and Induces Its Fibrillization,Ce Zhang; Yonggang Liu; Jonathan Gilthorpe; Johan RC van der Maarel,Increasing evidence supports the contribution of local inflammation to the development ofAlzheimer's disease (AD) pathology; although the precise mechanisms are not clear. In thisstudy; we demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 interacts with the A 1–40peptide and promotes the formation of fibrillar-amyloid structures. This interaction alsoresults in reduced S100A9 cytotoxicity by the binding of S100A9 toxic species to A 1–40amyloid structures. These results suggest that secretion of S100A9 during inflammationpromotes the formation of amyloid plaques. By acting as a sink for toxic species; plaqueformation may be the result of a protective response within the brain of AD patients; in partmediated by S100A9.,PloS one,2012,26
Influence of residue 22 on the folding; aggregation profile; and toxicity of the Alzheimer's amyloid β peptide,Alex Perálvarez-Marín; Laura Mateos; Ce Zhang; Shalini Singh; Ángel Cedazo-Mínguez; Neus Visa; Ludmilla Morozova-Roche; Astrid Gräslund; Andreas Barth,Abstract Several biophysical techniques have been used to determine differences in theaggregation profile (ie; the secondary structure; aggregation propensity; dynamics; andmorphology of amyloid structures) and the effects on cell viability of three variants of theamyloid β peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease. We focused our study on the Glu 22residue; comparing the effects of freshly prepared samples and samples aged for at least 20days. In the aged samples; a high propensity for aggregation and β-sheet secondarystructure appears when residue 22 is capable of establishing polar (Glu 22 in wild-type) orhydrophobic (Val 22 in E22V) interactions. The Arctic variant (E22G) presents a mixture ofmostly disordered and α-helix structures (with low β-sheet contribution).

Effect of H-NS on the elongation and compaction of single DNA molecules in a nanospace,Ce Zhang; Durgarao Guttula; Fan Liu; Piravi P Malar; Siow Yee Ng; Liang Dai; Patrick S Doyle; Jeroen A van Kan; Johan RC van der Maarel,The effect of the bacterial heat-stable nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) on theconformation of single DNA molecules confined in a nanochannel was investigated withfluorescence microscopy. With increasing concentration of H-NS; the DNA molecules eitherelongate or contract. The conformational response is related to filamentation of H-NS onDNA through oligomerization and H-NS mediated bridging of distal DNA segments and iscontrolled by the concentration and ionic composition of the buffer. Confinement in ananochannel also facilitates compaction of DNA into a condensed form for over-thresholdconcentrations of H-NS. Divalent ions such as magnesium facilitate but are not required forbridging nor condensation. The time scale of the collapse after exposure to H-NS wasdetermined to be on the order of minutes; which is much shorter than the measured time …,Soft Matter,2013,25
Intrinsic Determinants of Aβ12–24 pH-Dependent Self-Assembly Revealed by Combined Computational and Experimental Studies,Weixin Xu; Ce Zhang; Philippe Derreumaux; Astrid Gräslund; Ludmilla Morozova-Roche; Yuguang Mu,The propensity of amyloid-(A) peptide to self-assemble into highly ordered amyloidstructures lies at the core of their accumulation in the brain during Alzheimer's disease. Byusing all-atom explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations; weelucidated at the atomic level the intrinsic determinants of the pH-dependent dimerization ofthe central hydrophobic segment A and related these with the propensity to form amyloidfibrils measured by experimental tools such as atomic force microscopy and fluorescence.The process of A dimerization was evaluated in terms of free energy landscape; side-chaintwo-dimensional contact probability maps;-sheet registries; potential mean force as afunction of inter-chain distances; secondary structure development and radial solvationdistributions. We showed that dimerization is a key event in A amyloid formation; it is …,PloS one,2011,25
Lipoprotein complex of equine lysozyme with oleic acid (ELOA) interactions with the plasma membrane of live cells,Vladana Vukojević; Alice M Bowen; Kristina Wilhelm; Yu Ming; Zhang Ce; Jürgen Schleucher; PJ Hore; Lars Terenius; Ludmilla A Morozova-Roche,Recent evidence supports the idea that early aggregates; protein; and lipoprotein oligomersbut not large aggregates like fibrils that are formed at late stages of the aggregation processare responsible for cytotoxicity. Oligomers can interact with the cellular plasma membraneaffecting its structure and/or dynamics or may be taken up by the cells. In either case;disparate cascades of molecular interactions are activated in the attempt to counteract thedisturbance induced by the oligomers. If unsuccessful; cell death follows. Here; we study themolecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PC12 cell death caused by ELOA oligomers.ELOA; a lipoprotein complex formed by equine lysozyme (EL) and oleic acid (OA); inducescell death in all tested cell lines; but the actual mechanism of its action is not known.

Surface-directed and ethanol-induced DNA condensation on mica,Ce Zhang; Johan RC van der Maarel,The adsorption of λ-phage DNA onto mica was investigated with atomic force microscopy.We found that the morphologies depended on the solvent conditions in the samplepreparation procedure. Flat-lying networks of hybridized single-stranded DNA wereobtained if ultrapure water was used. If buffered conditions are maintained during the wholeof the preparation procedure; single double-stranded DNA molecules are adsorbed. Theadsorbed double-stranded DNA molecules subsequently can be condensed in situ on thesurface by a brief rinse with anhydrous ethanol in the presence of divalent magnesiumcations. The majority of these surface-directed and ethanol-induced condensed structuresare toroids; but a small fraction of rods also has been observed. Analysis of the height andlateral dimensions shows that the toroids are single-molecular and disk-like with a height …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2008,22

For this purpose; wedesigned and fabricated a nanofluidic device featuring two arrays of parallel nanochannelsin a perpendicular configuration. The cross-sections of the channels are rectangular with adiameter down to 175 nm. These lab-on-a-chip devices were made of polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) cast on a high quality master stamp; obtained by proton beam writing and UVlithography.

Nanouidic Compaction of DNA by Like-Charged Protein,Ce Zhang; Zongying Gong; Durgarao Guttula; Piravi P Malar; Jeroen A van Kan; Patrick S Doyle; Johan RC van der Maarel,The effects of the like-charged proteins bovine serum albumin and hemoglobin on theconformation and compaction of single DNA molecules confined in rectangularnanochannels were investigated with fluorescence microscopy. The channels have lengthsof 50 μm and cross-sectional diameters in the range of 80–300 nm. In the wider channels;the DNA molecules are compressed and eventually condense into a compact form withincreasing concentration of protein. In the narrow channels; no condensation was observed.The threshold concentration for condensation depends on the channel cross-sectionaldiameter as well as the ionic strength of the supporting medium. The critical values for fullcompaction are typically less than one-tenth of a millimolar. In the bulk phase and in thesame environmental conditions; no condensation was observed.

Amplified stretch of bottlebrush-coated DNA in nanofluidic channels,Ce Zhang; Armando Hernandez-Garcia; Kai Jiang; Zongying Gong; Durgarao Guttula; Siow Yee Ng; Piravi P Malar; Jeroen A van Kan; Liang Dai; Patrick S Doyle; Renko de Vries; Johan RC van der Maarel,Abstract The effect of a cationic-neutral diblock polypeptide on the conformation of singleDNA molecules confined in rectangular nanochannels is investigated with fluorescencemicroscopy. An enhanced stretch along the channel is observed with increased binding ofthe cationic block of the polypeptide to DNA. A maximum stretch of 85% of the contour lengthcan be achieved inside a channel with a cross-sectional diameter of 200 nm and at a 2-foldexcess of polypeptide with respect to DNA charge. With site-specific fluorescence labelling;it is demonstrated that this maximum stretch is sufficient to map large-scale genomicorganization. Monte Carlo computer simulation shows that the amplification of the stretchinside the nanochannels is owing to an increase in bending rigidity and thickness ofbottlebrush-coated DNA. The persistence lengths and widths deduced from the …,Nucleic acids research,2013,18
Exposure parameters in proton beam writing for hydrogen silsesquioxane,JA van Kan; F Zhang; C Zhang; AA Bettiol; F Watt,Abstract In proton beam writing (PBW) a focused MeV proton beam is scanned in apredetermined pattern over a resist (eg PMMA; SU-8 or HSQ); which is subsequentlychemically developed. In e-beam writing as well as p-beam writing the energy loss of theprimary beam is dominated by energy transfer to substrate electrons. Unlike the high energysecondary electrons generated during e-beam writing the secondary electrons induced bythe primary proton beam have low energy and therefore a limited range; resulting in minimalproximity effects. The low proximity effects exhibited by p-beam writing coupled with thestraight trajectory and high penetration of the proton beam enables the production of highaspect ratio; high density 3D micro and nanostructures with well defined smooth side wallsto be directly written into resist materials. This property together with the stability and …,Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms,2008,17

The depth; width and length ofthese structures can be controllably varied and we successfully fabricated an array ofcentimeter-long buried micro-and nanochannels. This process allows densely packed;arbitrary-shaped channel geometries with micro-to nanoscale dimensions to be produced ina three-dimensional multilevel architecture; providing a route to fabricate complex devicesfor use in nanofluidics and lab-on-a-chip systems.

Effects of Hfq on the conformation and compaction of DNA,Kai Jiang; Ce Zhang; Durgarao Guttula; Fan Liu; Jeroen A van Kan; Christophe Lavelle; Krzysztof Kubiak; Antoine Malabirade; Alain Lapp; Véronique Arluison; Johan RC van der Maarel,Abstract Hfq is a bacterial pleiotropic regulator that mediates several aspects of nucleicacids metabolism. The protein notably influences translation and turnover of cellular RNAs.Although most previous contributions concentrated on Hfq's interaction with RNA; itsassociation to DNA has also been observed in vitro and in vivo. Here; we focus on DNA-compacting properties of Hfq. Various experimental technologies; including fluorescencemicroscopy imaging of single DNA molecules confined inside nanofluidic channels; atomicforce microscopy and small angle neutron scattering have been used to follow the assemblyof Hfq on DNA. Our results show that Hfq forms a nucleoprotein complex; changes themechanical properties of the double helix and compacts DNA into a condensed form.

A Nanochannel Platform for Single DNA Studies: From Crowding; Protein DNA Interaction; to Sequencing of Genomic Information,Johan RC van der Maarel; Ce Zhang; Jeroen A van Kan,Abstract The study of nanochannel-confined DNA is important from biotechnological andbiophysical points of view. We produce nanochannels in elastomer with soft lithography andproton beam writing. Issues concerning DNA confined in such quasi one-dimensionalchannels are discussed. We describe DNA stretching via the control of channel diameterand buffer conditions and how the extension can be interpreted with theory and computersimulation. We then discuss the conformation of nano-confined DNA crowded by neutralpolymers and like-charged proteins. As an example of a protein that has an affinity to DNA;the effect of heat-stable nucleoid-structuring protein; H-NS; on the folding and compaction ofDNA is reviewed. Compaction of DNA by eukaryotic protamine and unpacking of pre-compacted DNA through an increase in salt concentration are discussed. We review …,Israel Journal of Chemistry,2014,7
S100A9 induces aggregation-prone conformation in Abeta peptides: a combined experimental and simulation study,Li Na Zhao; Tong Zhang; Ce Zhang; Chao Wang; Ludmilla A Morozova-Roche; Lock Yue Chew; Yuguang Mu,Inflammation is one of the prominent pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Recently; there have been various proposed roles of neuroinflammation; such as the drivingforces; bystander; byproduct or the neuroprotective response. Notwithstanding these diversepossible mechanisms; experiments have found that S100A9 is one of the pro-inflammatoryproteins abundant and over-expressed in the inflammation sites of AD. In this paper; weexamine the role of S100A9 in the oligomerization process of Aβ peptides by means ofreplica exchange molecular dynamics simulation and experimental investigations. Ourexperiments; based on atomic force microscopy and Thioflavin T spectroscopic assays; haveclearly indicated that the close interaction between S100A9 and Aβ has significantlyenhanced the Aβ oligomerization.

pH-Dependent Conformational Ensemble and Polymorphism of Amyloid-β Core Fragment,Weixin Xu; Ce Zhang; Ludmilla Morozova-Roche; John ZH Zhang; Yuguang Mu,Characterization of amyloid oligomeric species is important due to its possible responsibilityfor the toxicity of amyloid proteins; whereas it is difficult to detect by current spectroscopictechniques. The pH-dependent tetramerization and fibrillation of the central hydrophobicsegment of Alzheimer amyloid β-peptide (Aβ12–24) were respectively explored by all-atomreplica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and by fluorescence and atomic forcemicroscopy measurements. Our combined study shows that more β-sheet structures in theearly event of tetramerization is linked directly to the high propensity to form amyloid fibrils inthe consequent fibrillation. Both tetramerization and fibrillation are strongly regulated by pH.At pH 5.0; Aβ12–24 has two opposite terminal charges. The electrostatic attraction betweenthe side-chains of His13/His14 and Glu22/Asp23 thus acts as a” pattern keeper”; resulting …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2013,6
