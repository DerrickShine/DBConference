Jaql: A scripting language for large scale semistructured data analysis,Kevin S Beyer; Vuk Ercegovac; Rainer Gemulla; Andrey Balmin; Mohamed Eltabakh; Carl-Christian Kanne; Fatma Ozcan; Eugene J Shekita,ABSTRACT This paper describes Jaql; a declarative scripting language for analyzing largesemistructured datasets in parallel using Hadoop's MapReduce framework. Jaql is currentlyused in IBM's InfoS-phere BigInsights [5] and Cognos Consumer Insight [9] products. Jaql'sdesign features are:(1) a flexible data model;(2) reusability;(3) varying levels of abstraction;and (4) scalability. Jaql's data model is inspired by JSON and can be used to representdatasets that vary from flat; relational tables to collections of semistructured documents. AJaql script can start without any schema and evolve over time from a partial to a rigidschema. Reusability is provided through the use of higher-order functions and by packagingrelated functions into modules. Most Jaql scripts work at a high level of abstraction forconcise specification of logical operations (eg; join); but Jaql's notion of physical …,Proceedings of VLDB conference,2011,221
CoHadoop: flexible data placement and its exploitation in Hadoop,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Yuanyuan Tian; Fatma Özcan; Rainer Gemulla; Aljoscha Krettek; John McPherson,Abstract Hadoop has become an attractive platform for large-scale data analytics. In thispaper; we identify a major performance bottleneck of Hadoop: its lack of ability to colocaterelated data on the same set of nodes. To overcome this bottleneck; we introduceCoHadoop; a lightweight extension of Hadoop that allows applications to control where dataare stored. In contrast to previous approaches; CoHadoop retains the flexibility of Hadoop inthat it does not require users to convert their data to a certain format (eg; a relationaldatabase or a specific file format). Instead; applications give hints to CoHadoop that someset of files are related and may be processed jointly; CoHadoop then tries to colocate thesefiles for improved efficiency. Our approach is designed such that the strong fault toleranceproperties of Hadoop are retained. Colocation can be used to improve the efficiency of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,216

BDBMS--a database management system for biological data,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref,Abstract: Biologists are increasingly using databases for storing and managing their data.Biological databases typically consist of a mixture of raw data; metadata; sequences;annotations; and related data obtained from various sources. Current database technologylacks several functionalities that are needed by biological databases. In this paper; weintroduce bdbms; an extensible prototype database management system for supportingbiological data. bdbms extends the functionalities of current DBMSs to include:(1)Annotation and provenance management including storage; indexing; manipulation; andquerying of annotation and provenance as first class objects in bdbms;(2) Local dependencytracking to track the dependencies and derivations among data items;(3) Updateauthorization to support data curation via content-based authorization; in contrast to …,arXiv preprint cs/0612127,2006,48
Eagle-eyed elephant: split-oriented indexing in Hadoop,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Fatma Özcan; Yannis Sismanis; Peter J Haas; Hamid Pirahesh; Jan Vondrak,Abstract An increasingly important analytics scenario for Hadoop involves multiple (often adhoc) grouping and aggregation queries with selection predicates over a slowly changingdataset. These queries are typically expressed via high-level query languages such as Jaql;Pig; and Hive; and are used either directly for business-intelligence applications or toprepare the data for statistical model building and machine learning. In such scenarios it hasbeen increasingly recognized that; as in classical databases; techniques for avoiding accessto irrelevant data can dramatically improve query performance. Prior work on Hadoop;however; has simply ported classical techniques to the MapReduce setting; focusing onrecord-level indexing and key-based partition elimination. Unfortunately; record-levelindexing only slightly improves overall query performance; because it does not minimize …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,38
Supporting annotations on relations,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Mourad Ouzzani; Yasin N Silva,Abstract Annotations play a key role in understanding and curating databases. Annotationsmay represent comments; descriptions; lineage information; among several others.Annotation management is a vital mechanism for sharing knowledge and building aninteractive and collaborative environment among database users and scientists. Whatmakes it challenging is that annotations can be attached to database entities at variousgranularities; eg; at the table; tuple; column; cell levels; or more generally; to any subset ofcells that results from a select statement. Therefore; simple comment fields in tuples wouldnot work because of the combinatorial nature of the annotations. In this paper; we presentextensions to current database management systems to support annotations.

Space-partitioning trees in postgresql: Realization and performance,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Ramy Eltarras; Walid G Aref,Many evolving database applications warrant the use of non-traditional indexingmechanisms beyond B+-trees and hash tables. SP-GiST is an extensible indexingframework that broadens the class of supported indexes to include disk-based versions of awide variety of space-partitioning trees; eg; disk-based trie variants; quadtree variants; andkd-trees. This paper presents a serious attempt at implementing and realizing SP-GiST-based indexes inside PostgreSQL. Several index types are realized inside PostgreSQLfacilitated by rapid SP-GiST instantiations. Challenges; experiences; and performanceissues are addressed in the paper.

Incremental mining for frequent patterns in evolving time series datatabases,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Mourad Ouzzani; Mohamed A Khalil; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract Several emerging applications warrant mining and discovering hidden frequentpatterns in time series databases; eg; sensor networks; environment monitoring; andinventory stock monitoring. Time series databases are characterized by two features:(1) Thecontinuous arrival of data and (2) the time dimension. These features raise new challengesfor data mining such as the need for online processing and incremental evaluation of themining results. In this paper; we address the problem of discovering frequent patterns indatabases with multiple time series. We propose an incremental technique for discoveringthe complete set of frequent patterns; ie; discovering the frequent patterns over the entiretime series in contrast to a sliding window over a portion of the time series. The proposedapproach updates the mining results with the arrival of every new data item by …,*,2008,23
The SBC-tree: An index for run-length compressed sequences,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Wing-Kai Hon; Rahul Shah; Walid G Aref; Jeffrey S Vitter,Abstract Run-Length-Encoding (RLE) is a data compression technique that is used invarious applications; eg; time series; biological sequences; and multimedia databases. Oneof the main challenges is how to operate on (eg; index; search; and retrieve) compresseddata without decompressing it. In this paper; we introduce the< u> S</u> tring< u> B</u>-tree for< u> C</u> ompressed sequences; termed the SBC-tree; for indexing and searchingRLE-compressed sequences of arbitrary length. The SBC-tree is a two-level index structurebased on the well-known String B-tree and a 3-sided range query structure [7].

Recurring queries;repeatedly being executed for long periods of time over evolving high-volume data; havebecome a bedrock component in most large-scale data analytic applications. Redoop is acomprehensive extension to Hadoop that pushes the support and optimization of recurringqueries into Hadoop's core functionality. While backward compatible with regularMapReduce jobs; Redoop achieves an order of magnitude better performance than Hadoopfor recurring workloads. Redoop employs innovative window-aware optimization techniquesfor such recurring workloads including adaptive window-aware data partitioning; cache-aware task scheduling; and inter-window caching mechanisms.

Shared execution of recurring workloads in MapReduce,Chuan Lei; Zhongfang Zhuang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Mohamed Eltabakh,Abstract With the increasing complexity of data-intensive MapReduce workloads; Hadoopmust often accommodate hundreds or even thousands of recurring analytics queries thatperiodically execute over frequently updated datasets; eg; latest stock transactions; new logfiles; or recent news feeds. For many applications; such recurring queries come with user-specified service-level agreements (SLAs); commonly expressed as the maximum allowedlatency for producing results before their merits decay. The recurring nature of theseemerging workloads combined with their SLA constraints make it challenging to share andoptimize their execution. While some recent efforts on multi-job optimization in MapReducehave emerged; they focus on only sharing work among ad-hoc jobs on static datasets.Unfortunately; these sharing techniques neither take the recurring nature of the queries …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,9
InsightNotes: summary-based annotation management in relational databases,Dongqing Xiao; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,Abstract In this paper; we address the challenges that arise from the growing scale ofannotations in scientific databases. On one hand; end-users and scientists are incapable ofanalyzing and extracting knowledge from the large number of reported annotations; eg; onetuple may have hundreds of annotations attached to it over time. On the other hand; currentannotation management techniques fall short in providing advanced processing over theannotations beyond just propagating them to end-users. To address this limitation; wepropose the InsightNotes system; a summary-based annotation management engine inrelational databases. InsightNotes integrates data mining and summarization techniquesinto annotation management in novel ways with the objective of creating and reportingconcise representations (summaries) of the raw annotations.

Redoop: Supporting Recurring Queries in Hadoop.,Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,ABSTRACT The growing demand for large-scale data analytics ranging from onlineadvertisement placement; log processing; to fraud detection; has led to the design of highlyscalable data-intensive computing infrastructures such as the Hadoop platform. Recurringqueries; repeatedly being executed for long periods of time on rapidly evolving high-volumedata; have become a bedrock component in most of these analytic applications. Despitetheir importance; the plain Hadoop along with its state-of-art extensions lack built-in supportfor recurring queries. In particular; they lack efficient and scalable analytics over evolvingdatasets. In this work; we present the Redoop system; an extension of the Hadoopframework; designed to fill in this void.

Exploiting soft and hard correlations in big data query optimization,Hai Liu; Dongqing Xiao; Pankaj Didwania; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,Abstract Big data infrastructures are increasingly supporting datasets that are relativelystructured. These datasets are full of correlations among their attributes; which if managed insystematic ways would enable optimization opportunities that otherwise will be missed.Unlike relational databases in which discovering and exploiting the correlations in queryoptimization have been extensively studied; in big data infrastructures; such important dataproperties and their utilization have been mostly abandoned. The key reason is that domainexperts may know many correlations but with a degree of uncertainty (fuzziness or softness).Since the data is big; it is very challenging to validate such correlations; judge theirworthiness; and put strategies for utilizing them in query optimization. Existing techniques forexploiting soft correlations in RDBMSs; eg; BHUNT; CORDS; and CM; are heavily tailored …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,5

Query processing with K-anonymity,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Jalaja Padma; Yasin N Silva; Pei He; Walid G Aref; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Anonymization techniques are used to ensure the privacy preservation of the dataowners; especially for personal and sensitive data. While in most cases; data reside insidethe database management system; most of the proposed anonymization techniques operateon and anonymize isolated datasets stored outside the DBMS. Hence; most of the desiredfunctionalities of the DBMS are lost; eg; consistency; recoverability; and efficient querying. Inthis paper; we address the challenges involved in enforcing the data privacy inside theDBMS. We implement the k-anonymity algorithm as a relational operator that interacts withother query operators to apply the privacy requirements while querying the data. We studyanonymizing a single table; multiple tables; and complex queries that involve multiplepredicates.

Elevating Annotation Summaries To First-Class Citizens In InsightNotes.,Karim Ibrahim; Dongqing Xiao; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,ABSTRACT Most scientific and modern applications generate—in addition to the base data—valuable annotations and metadata information at unprecedented scale and complexity.Such annotations warrant the need for advanced annotation management techniques thatnot only propagate the raw annotations to end-users; but also mine; summarize; and extractuseful knowledge from them. Towards this goal; we proposed the InsightNotes system; thefirst summary-based annotation management engine in relational databases [22]. Insight-Notes relies on creating concise representations of the raw annotations; called annotationsummaries. InsightNotes addresses several unique challenges related to the maintenance;propagation; and zooming of these summaries. However; a key limitation is that theannotation summaries are treated as propagate-only (report-only) objects that cannot be …,EDBT,2015,4
Handson db: Managing data dependencies involving human actions,Mohamed Eltabakh; Walid Aref; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Mourad Ouzzani,Consider two values; x and y; in the database; where y= F (x). To maintain the consistency ofthe data; whenever x changes; F needs to be executed to re-compute y and update its valuein the database. This is straightforward in the case where F can be executed by the DBMS;eg; SQL or C function. In this paper; we address the more challenging case where F is ahuman action; eg; conducting a wet-lab experiment; taking manual measurements; orcollecting instrument readings. In this case; when x changes; y remains invalid (inconsistentwith the current value of x) until the human action involved in the derivation is performed andits output result is reflected into the database. Many application domains; eg; scientificapplications in biology; chemistry; and physics; contain multiple such derivations anddependencies that involve human actions. In this paper; we propose HandsOn DB; a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,4
Duplicate Elimination in Space-partitioning Tree Indexes,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Mourad Ouzzani; Walid G Aref,Space-partitioning trees; like the disk-based trie; quadtree; kd-tree and their variants; are afamily of access methods that index multi-dimensional objects. In the case of indexing non-zero extent objects; eg; line segments and rectangles; space-partitioning trees may replicateobjects over multiple space partitions; eg; PMR quadtree; expanded MX-CIF quadtree; andextended kd-tree. As a result; the answer to a query over these indexes may includeduplicates that need to be eliminated; ie; the same object may be reported more than once.In this paper; we propose generic duplicate elimination techniques for the class of space-partitioning trees in the context of SP-GiST; an extensible indexing framework for realizingspace-partitioning trees. The proposed techniques are embedded inside the INDEX-SCANoperator. Therefore; duplicate copies of the same object do not propagate in the query …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007. SSBDM'07. 19th International Conference on,2007,4

Supporting real-world activities in database management systems,Mohamed Y Eltabakh; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Yasin N Silva; Mourad Ouzzani,The cycle of processing the data in many application domains is complex and may involvereal-world activities that are external to the database; eg; wet-lab experiments; instrumentreadings; and manual measurements. These real-world activities may take long time toprepare for and to perform; and hence introduce inherently long time delays between theupdates in the database. The presence of these long delays between the updates; alongwith the need for the intermediate results to be instantly available; makes supporting real-world activities in the database engine a challenging task. In this paper; we address thesechallenges through a system that enables users to reflect their updates immediately into thedatabase while keeping track of the dependent and potentially invalid data items until theyare re-validated.

Decorating the cloud: enabling annotation management in MapReduce,Yue Lu; Yuguan Li; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,Abstract Data curation and annotation are indispensable mechanisms to a wide range ofapplications for capturing various types of metadata information. This metadata not onlyincreases the data's credibility and merit; and allows end users and applications to makemore informed decisions; but also enables advanced processing over the data that is notfeasible otherwise. That is why annotation management has been extensively studied in thecontext of scientific repositories; web documents; and relational database systems. In thispaper; we make the case that cloud-based applications that rely on the emerging Hadoopinfrastructure are also in need for data curation and annotation and that the presence ofsuch mechanisms in Hadoop would bring value-added capabilities to these applications.We propose the “CloudNotes” system; a full-fledged MapReduce-based annotation …,The VLDB Journal,2016,1

Furthermore; DOD overturns twofundamental assumptions widely adopted in the distributed analytics literature; namelycardinality-based load balancing and one algorithm for all data. The multi-tactic strategy ofDOD achieves a truly balanced workload by taking into account the data characteristics indata partitioning and assigns most appropriate algorithm for each partition based on ourtheoretical cost models established for distinct classes of detection algorithms.

Data Organization and Curation in Big Data,Mohamed Y Eltabakh,Abstract This chapter covers advanced techniques in Big Data analytics and queryprocessing. As the data is getting bigger and; at the same time; workloads and analytics aregetting more complex; the advances in big data applications are no longer hindered by theirability to collect or generate data. But instead; by their ability to efficiently and effectivelymanage the available data. Therefore; numerous scalable and distributed infrastructureshave been proposed to manage big data. However; it is well known in literature thatscalability and distributed processing alone are not enough to achieve high performance.Instead; the underlying infrastructure has to be highly optimized for various types ofworkloads and query classes. These optimizations typically start from the lowest layer of thedata management stack; which is the storage layer. In this chapter; we will cover two well …,*,2017,*
PRO: Preference-Aware Recurring Query Optimization,Zhongfang Zhuang; Chuan Lei; Elke Rundensteiner; Mohamed Eltabakh,Abstract While recurring queries over evolving data are the bedrock of the analyticalapplications; resources demanded to process a large amount of data for each recurringexecution can be a fatal bottleneck in cost-sensitive cloud computing environments. It is thusimperative to design a system responsive to users' preferences regarding how resourcesshould be utilized. In this work; we propose PRO; a preference-aware recurring queryprocessing system that optimizes recurring query executions complying with userpreferences. First; we show that finding an optimal is an NP-complete problem due to thecost interdependencies between consecutive executions. We propose an execution relationgraph (ERG) model that effectively incorporates these dependencies between executions.This model enables us to transform our problem into a well-known graph problem.

Bermuda: An Efficient MapReduce Triangle Listing Algorithm for Web-Scale Graphs,Dongqing Xiao; Mohamed Eltabakh; Xiangnan Kong,Abstract Triangle listing plays an important role in graph analysis and has numerous graphmining applications. With the rapid growth of graph data; distributed methods for listingtriangles over massive graphs are urgently needed. Therefore; the triangle listing problemhas been studied in several distributed infrastructures including MapReduce. However;existing algorithms suffer from generating and shuffling huge amounts of intermediate data;where interestingly; a large percentage of this data is redundant. Inspired by thisobservation; we present the" Bermuda" method; an efficient MapReducebased trianglelisting technique for massive graphs. Different from existing approaches; Bermuda effectivelyreduces the size of the intermediate data via redundancy elimination and sharing ofmessages whenever possible. As a result; Bermuda achieves orders-of-magnitudes of …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,*
Discovering Correlations in Annotated Databases.,Xuebin He; Stephen Donohue; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,ABSTRACT Most emerging applications; especially in science domains; maintain databasesthat are rich in metadata and annotation information; eg; auxiliary exchanged comments;related articles and images; provenance information; corrections and versioning information;and even scientists' thoughts and observations. To manage these annotated databases;numerous techniques have been proposed to extend the DBMSs and efficiently integrate theannotations into the data processing cycle; eg; storage; indexing; extended query languagesand semantics; and query optimization. In this paper; we address a new facet of annotationmanagement; which is the discovery and exploitation of the hidden corrections that mayexist in annotated databases. Such correlations can be either between the data and theannotations (data-to-annotation); or between the annotations themselves (annotation-to …,EDBT,2016,*
Proactive Annotation Management in Relational Databases,Karim Ibrahim; Xiao Du; Mohamed Eltabakh,Abstract Annotation management and data curation has been extensively studied in thecontext of relational databases. However; existing annotation management techniquesshare a common limitation; which is that they are all passive engines; ie; they only managethe annotations obtained from external sources such as DB admins; domain experts; andcuration tools. They neither learn from the available annotations nor exploit the annotations-to-data correlations to further enhance the quality of the annotated database. Delegatingsuch crucial and complex tasks to end-users---especially under large-scale databases andannotation sets---is clearly the wrong choice. In this paper; we propose the Nebula system;an advanced and proactive annotation management engine in relational databases. Nebulacomplements the state-of-art techniques in annotation management by learning from the …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,*
Complex Patten Processing in Spatio-temporal Databases.,Yang Zheng; Annies Ductan; Devin Thomas; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,Abstract: The increasing complexity of spatio-temporal applications has caused theunderlying queries to be more sophisticated and usually carry complex semantics. As aresult; the traditional spatio-temporal query types; eg; range; kNN; and aggregation queries;have become just building blocks in more complex query plans. In this paper; we present theSTEPQ system; which is an extensible spatio-temporal query engine for complex patternprocessing over spatio-temporal data. STEPQ enables full-fledged and optimized integrationbetween spatiotemporal queries and complex event processing (CEP). This integrationenables expressing complex queries that execute the desired application semantics withoutthe need for indifferent middle-aware or applicationlevel support. The system isimplemented using TerraLib module on top of PostgreSQL DBMSs. The experimental …,DATA,2014,*
FunctionGuard-A Query Engine for Expensive Scientific Functions in Relational Databases.,Anh Pham; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,Abstract: Expensive user-defined functions impose unique challenges to databasemanagement systems at query time. This is mostly due to the black-box nature of thesefunctions; the in-ability to optimize their internals; and the potential inefficiency of thecommon optimization heuristics; eg;“selection-push-down'. Moreover; the increasingdiversity of modern scientific applications that depend on DBMSs and; at the same time;extensively use expensive UDFs is mandating the design and development of efficienttechniques to support these expensive functions. In this paper; we propose the“FunctionGuard” system that leverages disk-based persistent caching in novel ways toachieve across-queries optimizations for expensive UDFs. The unique features ofFunctionGuard include:(1) Dynamic extraction of dependencies between the UDFs and …,DATA,2014,*

Discovering consensus patterns in biological databases,Mohamed Y ElTabakh; Walid G Aref; Mourad Ouzzani; Mohamed H Ali,Abstract Consensus patterns; like motifs and tandem repeats; are highly conserved patternswith very few substitutions where no gaps are allowed. In this paper; we present aprogressive hierarchical clustering technique for discovering consensus patterns inbiological databases over a certain length range. This technique can discover consensuspatterns with various requirements by applying a post-processing phase. The progressivenature of the hierarchical clustering algorithm makes it scalable and efficient. Experiments todiscover motifs and tandem repeats on real biological databases show significantperformance gain over non-progressive clustering techniques.,VLDB Workshop on Data Mining and Bioinformatics,2006,*
19th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management (SSDBM 2007),R Fomkin; T Risch,High energy physics scientists analyze large amounts of data looking for interesting eventswhen particles collide. These analyses are easily expressed using complex queries thatfilter events. We developed a cost model for aggregation operators and other functions usedin such queries and show that it substantially improves performance. However; the queryoptimizer still produces suboptimal plans...,*,*,*
