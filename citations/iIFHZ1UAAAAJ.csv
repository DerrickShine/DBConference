Hierarchical parallel coordinates for exploration of large datasets,Ying-Huey Fua; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Our ability to accumulate large; complex (multivariate) data sets has far exceededour ability to effectively process them in search of patterns; anomalies; and other interestingfeatures. Conventional multivariate visualization techniques generally do not scale well withrespect to the size of the data set. The focus of this paper is on the interactive visualization oflarge multivariate data sets based on a number of novel extensions to the parallelcoordinates display technique. We develop a multiresolutional view of the data viahierarchical clustering; and use a variation on parallel coordinates to convey aggregationinformation for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until thedesired focus region and level of detail is reached; using our suite of navigational andfiltering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel …,Proceedings of the conference on Visualization'99: celebrating ten years,1999,506
Clutter reduction in multi-dimensional data visualization using dimension reordering,Wei Peng; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Visual clutter denotes a disordered collection of graphical entities in informationvisualization. Clutter can obscure the structure present in the data. Even in a small dataset;clutter can make it hard for the viewer to find patterns; relationships and structure. In thispaper; we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with theviewer's understanding of the data; and present the concept of clutter-based dimensionreordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualization'sexpressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display; it is possible to reduce clutterwithout reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is adisplay-dependent task. In this paper; we follow a three-step procedure for four differentvisualization techniques. For each display technique; first; we determine what constitutes …,Information Visualization; 2004.

Hierarchical encoded path views for path query processing: An optimal model and its performance evaluation,Ning Jing; Y-W Huang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Efficient path computation is essential for applications such as intelligent transportationsystems (ITS) and network routing. In ITS navigation systems; many path requests can besubmitted over the same; typically huge; transportation network within a small time window.While path precomputation (path view) would provide an efficient path query response; itraises three problems which must be addressed: 1) precomputed paths exceed the currentcomputer main memory capacity for large networks; 2) disk-based solutions are tooinefficient to meet the stringent requirements of these target applications; and 3) path viewsbecome too costly to update for large graphs (resulting in out-of-date query results). Wepropose a hierarchical encoded path view (HEPV) model that addresses all three problems.By hierarchically encoding partial paths; HEPV reduces the view encoding time; updating …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1998,286
Multiview: A methodology for supporting multiple views in object-oriented databases,Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract A view in object-oriented databases (OODB) corresponds to virtual schema graphwith possibly restructured generalization and decomposition hierarchies. We propose amethodology; called MultiView; for supporting multiple such view schemata. MultiViewrepresents a simple yet powerful approach achieved by breaking view speci cation intoindependent tasks: class derivation; global schema integration; view class selection; andview schema generation. Novel features of MultiView include an object algebra for classcustomization; an algorithm for the integration of virtual classes into the global schema; aview de nition language for view class selection; and the automatic generation of a viewclass hierarchy. In addition; we present algorithms that verify the closure property of a viewand; if found to be incomplete; transform it into a closed; yet minimal; view. Lastly; we …,VLDB,1992,277
Spatial joins using R-trees: Breadth-first traversal with global optimizations,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract R-tree based spatial join is useful because of both its superior performance and thewide spread implementation of R-trees. We present a new R-tree join method called BFRJ(Breadth-First R-tree Join). BFRJ synchronously traverses both R-trees in breadthrst orderwhile processing join computation one level at a time. At each level; BFRJ creates anintermediate join index and deploys global optimization strategies (ordering; memorymanagement; bu er management) to improve the join computation at the next level. We alsopresent an experimental evaluation of the proposed optimizations as well as a performancecomparison between BFRJ and the state-of-the-art approach. Our experimental resultsindicate that BFRJ with global optimizations can outperform the competitor by a signi cantmargin (up to 50%). 0.05 in This work was supported in part by the University of Michigan …,VLDB,1997,266

Interactive hierarchical dimension ordering; spacing and filtering for exploration of high dimensional datasets,Jing Yang; Wei Peng; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Large number of dimensions not only cause clutter in multi-dimensional visualizations; butalso make it difficult for users to navigate the data space. Effective dimension management;such as dimension ordering; spacing and filtering; is critical for visual exploration of suchdatasets. Dimension ordering and spacing explicitly reveal dimension relationships inarrangement-sensitive multidimensional visualization techniques; such as parallelcoordinates; star glyphs; and pixel-oriented techniques. They facilitate the visual discoveryof patterns within the data. Dimension filtering hides some of the dimensions to reduceclutter while preserving the major information of the dataset. In this paper; we propose aninteractive hierarchical dimension ordering; spacing and filtering approach; called DOSFA.DOSFA is based on dimension hierarchies derived from similarities among dimensions.

Maintaining data warehouses over changing information sources,Elke A Rundensteiner; Andreas Koeller; Xin Zhang,In recent years; the number of digital informa-tion storage and retrieval systems hasincreased immensely. These information sources are gen-erally interconnected via somenetwork; and hence the task of integrating data from different sources to serve it up to usersis an increasingly important one [10]. Applications that could benefit from this wealth ofdigital information are thus experiencing a pressing need for suitable integration tools thatallow them to make effective use of such distributed and diverse data sets. In contrast to theon-demand approach to information integration; the approach of tailored informationrepository construction; commonly referred to as data warehousing; is characterized by thefollowing properties:,Communications of the ACM,2000,188
Visual hierarchical dimension reduction for exploration of high dimensional datasets,Jing Yang; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Traditional visualization techniques for multidimensional data sets; such as parallelcoordinates; glyphs; and scatterplot matrices; do not scale well to high numbers ofdimension. A common approach to solving this problem is dimensionality reduction. Existingdimensionality reduction techniques usually generate lower dimensional spaces that havelittle intuitive meaning to users and allow little user interaction. In this paper we propose anew approach to handling high dimensional data; named Visual Hierarchical DimensionReduction (VHDR); which addresses these drawbacks. VHDR not only generates lowerdimensional spaces that are meaningful to users; but also allows user interactions in moststeps of the process. In VHDR; dimensions are grouped into a hierarchy; and lowerdimensional spaces are constructed using clusters of the hierarchy. We have …,*,2002,159

Dynamic plan migration for continuous queries over data streams,Yali Zhu; Elke A Rundensteiner; George T Heineman,Abstract Dynamic plan migration is concerned with the on-the-fly transition from onecontinuous query plan to a semantically equivalent yet more efficient plan. Migration isimportant for stream monitoring systems where long-running queries may have to withstandfluctuations in stream workloads and data characteristics. Existing migration methodsgenerally adopt a pause-drain-resume strategy that pauses the processing of new data;purges all old data in the existing plan; until finally the new plan can be plugged into thesystem. However; these existing strategies do not address the problem of migrating queryplans that contain stateful operators; such as joins. We now develop solutions for online planmigration for continuous stateful plans. In particular; in this paper; we propose twoalternative strategies; called the moving state strategy and the parallel track strategy; one …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,154
Automating the transformation of XML documents,Hong Su; Harumi Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract The advent of web services that use XML-based message exchanges has spurredmany efforts that address issues related to inter-enterprise service electronic commerceinteractions. Currently emerging standards and technologies enable enterprises to describeand advertise their own Web Services and to discover and determine how to interact withservices fronted by other businesses. However; these technologies do not address theproblem of how to reconcile structural differences between similar types of documentssupported by different enterprises.

A transparent schema-evolution system based on object-oriented view technology,Young-Gook Ra; Elke A.

The paper addresses the problem byintegrating schema evolution with view facilities. When new requirements necessitateschema updates for a particular user; then the user specifies schema changes to hispersonal view; rather than to the shared base schema. Our view schema evolution approachthen computes a new view schema that reflects the semantics of the desired schemachange; and replaces the old view with the new one.

On nearness measures in fuzzy relational data models,Elke A Rundensteiner; Lois W Hawkes; Wyllis Bandler,Abstract It has been widely recognized that the imprecision and incompleteness inherent inreal-world data suggest a fuzzy extension for information management systems. Variousattempts to enhance these systems by fuzzy extensions can be found in the literature.Varying approaches concerning the fuzzification of the concept of a relation are possible;two of which are referred to in this article as the generalized fuzzy approach and the fuzzy-set relation approach. In these enhanced models; items can no longer be retrieved bymerely using equality-check operations between constants; instead; operations based onsome kind of nearness measures have to be developed. In fact; these models require such anearness measure to be established for each domain for the evaluation of queries madeupon them.

Mapping nominal values to numbers for effective visualization,Geraldine E Rosario; Elke A Rundensteiner; David C Brown; Matthew O Ward; Shiping Huang,Data sets with a large numbers of nominal variables; including some with large number ofdistinct values; are becoming increasingly common and need to be explored. Unfortunately;most existing visual exploration tools are designed to handle numeric variables only. Whenimporting data sets with nominal values into such visualization tools; most solutions to dateare rather simplistic. Often; techniques that map nominal values to numbers do not assignorder or spacing among the values in a manner that conveys semantic relationships.Moreover; displays designed for nominal variables usually cannot handle high cardinalityvariables well.

FS-Miner: efficient and incremental mining of frequent sequence patterns in web logs,Maged El-Sayed; Carolina Ruiz; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Mining frequent patterns is an important component of many prediction systems.One common usage in web applications is the mining of users' access behavior for thepurpose of predicting and hence pre-fetching the web pages that the user is likely to visit. Inthis paper we introduce an efficient strategy for discovering frequent patterns in sequencedatabases that requires only two scans of the database. The first scan obtains supportcounts for subsequences of length two. The second scan extracts potentially frequentsequences of any length and represents them as a compressed frequent sequences treestructure (FS-tree). Frequent sequence patterns are then mined from the FS-tree.Incremental and interactive mining functionalities are also facilitated by the FS-tree.

Sequence pattern query processing over out-of-order event streams,Mo Liu; Ming Li; Denis Golovnya; Elke A Rundensteiner; Kajal Claypool,Complex event processing has become increasingly important in modern applications;ranging from RFID tracking for supply chain management to real-time intrusion detection. Akey aspect of complex event processing is to extract patterns from event streams to makeinformed decisions in real-time. However; network latencies and machine failures maycause events to arrive out-of-order at the event processing engine. State-of-the-art eventstream processing technology experiences significant challenges when faced with out-of-order data arrival including output blocking; huge system latencies; memory resourceoverflow; and incorrect result generation. To address these problems; we propose twoalternate solutions: aggressive and conservative strategies respectively to processsequence pattern queries on out-of-order event streams.

Structure-based brushes: A mechanism for navigating hierarchically organized data and information spaces,Ying-Huey Fua; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Interactive selection is a critical component in exploratory visualization; allowing users toisolate subsets of the displayed information for highlighting; deleting; analysis; or focusedinvestigation.

XCache: a semantic caching system for XML queries,Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner; Song Wang,Abstract A wide range of Web applications retrieve desired information from remote XMLdata sources across the Internet; which is usually costly due to transmission delays for largevolumes of data. Therefore we propose to apply the ideas of semantic caching to XML queryprocessing systems [2]; in particular the XQuery engine. Semantic caching [3] implies view-based query answering and cache management. While it is well studied in the traditionaldatabase context; query containment for XQuery is left unexplored due to its complexitycoming with the powerful expressiveness of hierarchy; recursion and result construction. Wehence have developed the first solution for XQuery processing using cached views.

Effective graph clustering for path queries in digital map databases,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,In this paper; we present an experimental evaluation of graph clustering strategies in termsof their effectiveness in optimizing I/O for path query processing in digital map databases.Clustering optimization is attractive because it does not incurs any run-time cost; and iscomplimentary to many of the existing techniques in path query optimization. We firstpropose a novel graph clustering technique; called Spatial Partition Clustering(SPC); thatcreates balanced partitions of links based on the spatial proximity of their origin nodes. Wethen select three alternative clustering techniques from the literature; namely two-waypartitioning; approximately topological clustering; and random clustering; to compare theirperformance in path query processing with SPC.

We propose to address this new view evolution problem—which we callview synchronization—by a novel solution approach that allows affected view definitions tobe dynamically evolved to keep them in synch with evolving ISs. We present in this paper ageneral strategy for the view synchronization process that guided by constraints imposed bythe view evolution preferences embedded in the view definition achieves view preservation(ie; view redefinition).

A cost model for estimating the performance of spatial joins using R-trees,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,The development of a cost model for predicting the performance of spatial joins has beenidentified in the literature as an important and difficult problem. The authors present the firstcost model that can predict the performance of spatial joins using R-trees. Based on twoexisting R-trees (join targets); the model first estimates the number of expected I/Os for thejoin process by assuming a zero buffer size. The method for this estimation extends the costmodel for R-tree window queries (developed by Kamel and Faloutsos (1993) and by Pagelet al.(1993)) to also handle spatial joins (which are more complex). In the context of spatialjoin processing; this number of zero-buffer expected I/Os is not practical for performanceprediction in a buffered environment. To model the buffer impact; they use an (exponential)distribution function to measure the probability that a bufferless I/O would cause a page …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1997.

Theytend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tackling complexknowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usually impeded dueto several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when too much data isvisualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize their discoveries off line;because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3) their discoveries basedon visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; 4) and they have no convenient access tothe important knowledge learned by other users.

Value and relation display for interactive exploration of high dimensional datasets,Jing Yang; Anilkumar Patro; Shiping Huang; Nishant Mehta; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Traditional multidimensional visualization techniques; such as glyphs; parallel coordinatesand scatterplot matrices; suffer from clutter at the display level and difficult user navigationamong dimensions when visualizing high dimensional datasets. In this paper; we propose anew multidimensional visualization technique named a value and relation (VaR) display;together with a rich set of navigation and selection tools; for interactive exploration ofdatasets with up to hundreds of dimensions.

The MultiView OODB view system: Design and implementation,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Views are an established technique for restructuring and repartitioning the format of data;classes; and schemata so that applications can customize shared data objects without a ectingother applications' perceptions of the data. The MultiView system is one of the rst OODB systemsto support dynamic and updatable materialized object-oriented database views. MultiView isfully func- tional and is being used for a number of projects. In this paper; we describe our system'sarchitecture; the services it provides; and the decisions we made during our imple-mentation. Although the GemStone system we chose for our implementation base o ers manyfeatures that greatly aided our implementation; it does not support several key object-model propertiesthat are critical for the realization of our design principles. These fundamental properties in- cludemultiple classi cation; dynamic object-restructuring; and the ability to make dynamic …,Ann Arbor,1996,67
Privacy protected query processing on spatial networks,Wei-Shinn Ku; Roger Zimmermann; Wen-Chih Peng; Sushama Shroff,With the proliferation of mobile devices (eg; PDAs; cell phones; etc.); location-basedservices have become more and more popular in recent years. However; users have toreveal their location information to access location-based services with existing serviceinfrastructures. It is possible that adversaries could collect the location information; which inturn invades user's privacy. There are existing solutions for query processing on spatialnetworks and mobile user privacy protection in Euclidean space. However there is nosolution for solving queries on spatial networks with privacy protection. Therefore; we aim toprovide network distance spatial query solutions which can preserve user privacy by utilizingK-anonymity mechanisms. In this paper; we present two novel query algorithms; PSNN andPSRQ; for answering nearest neighbor queries and range queries on spatial networks …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,66
The EVE approach: View synchronization in dynamic distributed environments,Amy J.  Lee; Anisoara Nica; Elke A.  Rundensteiner,The construction and maintenance of data warehouses (views) in large-scale environmentscomposed of numerous distributed and evolving information sources (ISs) such as the WWWhas received great attention recently. Such environments are plagued with changinginformation because ISs tend to continuously evolve by modifying not only their content butalso their query capabilities and interface and by joining or leaving the environment at anytime. We are the first to introduce and address the problem of schema changes of ISs; whileprevious work in this area; such as incremental view maintenance; has mainly dealt withdata changes at ISs. We outline our solution approach to this challenging new problem ofhow to adapt views in such evolving environments. We identify a new view adaptationproblem for view evolution in the context of ISs schema changes; which we call view …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2002,66
An extended database design methodology for uncertain data management,Nauman Chaudhry; James Moyne; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Many real world systems require the support of database management systems(DBMS) that can handle vague or imprecise data. Fuzzy theory has been shown to beparticularly suitable for this purpose. Indeed there have been several proposals forextending the relational data model in order to represent and query fuzzy data. However;little work has been done in modeling uncertainty at the conceptual schema level or formapping such a schema to a relational DBMS. To fill this gap; we propose fuzzy entity-relationship methodology (FERM); which is a comprehensive methodology for design anddevelopment of fuzzy relational databases. FERM includes an extended fuzzy entity-relationship model to capture imprecision at the schema level as well as generic rules formapping this schema to relational databases. In this paper; we also show the application …,Information sciences,1999,66
Runtime semantic query optimization for event stream processing,Luping Ding; Songting Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner; Junichi Tatemura; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selcuk Candan,Detecting complex patterns in event streams; ie; complex event processing (CEP); hasbecome increasingly important for modern enterprises to react quickly to critical situations. Inmany practical cases business events are generated based on pre-defined business logics.Hence constraints; such as occurrence and order constraints; often hold among events.Reasoning using these known constraints enables us to predict the non-occurrences ofcertain future events; thereby helping us to identify and then terminate the long runningquery processes that are guaranteed to not lead to successful matches. In this work; wefocus on exploiting event constraints to optimize CEP over large volumes of businesstransaction streams. Since the optimization opportunities arise at runtime; we develop aruntime query unsatisfiability (RunSAT) checking technique that detects optimal points for …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Joining punctuated streams,Luping Ding; Nishant Mehta; Elke A Rundensteiner; George T Heineman,Abstract We focus on stream join optimization by exploiting the constraints that aredynamically embedded into data streams to signal the end of transmitting certain attributevalues. These constraints are called punctuations. Our stream join operator; PJoin; is able toremove no-longer-useful data from the state in a timely manner based on punctuations; thusreducing memory overhead and improving the efficiency of probing. We equip PJoin withseveral alternate strategies for purging the state and for propagating punctuations to benefitdown-stream operators. We also present an extensive experimental study to explore theperformance gains achieved by purging state as well as the trade-off between differentpurge strategies. Our experimental results of comparing the performance of PJoin withXJoin; a stream join operator without a constraint-exploiting mechanism; show that PJoin …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,65
Neighbor-based pattern detection for windows over streaming data,Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract The discovery of complex patterns such as clusters; outliers; and associations fromhuge volumes of streaming data has been recognized as critical for many domains.However; pattern detection with sliding window semantics; as required by applicationsranging from stock market analysis to moving object tracking remains largely unexplored.Applying static pattern detection algorithms from scratch to every window is prohibitivelyexpensive due to their high algorithmic complexity. This work tackles this problem bydeveloping the first solution for incremental detection of neighbor-based patterns specific tosliding window scenarios. The specific pattern types covered in this work include density-based clusters and distance-based outliers. Incremental pattern computation in highlydynamic streaming environments is challenging; because purging a large amount of to …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,64
A security punctuation framework for enforcing access control on streaming data,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,The management of privacy and security in the context of data stream management systems(DSMS) remains largely an unaddressed problem to date. Unlike in traditional DBMSswhere access control policies are persistently stored on the server and tend to remainstable; in streaming applications the contexts and with them the access control policies onthe real-time data may rapidly change. A person entering a casino may want to immediatelyblock others from knowing his current whereabouts. We thus propose a novel" stream-centric" approach; where security restrictions are not persistently stored on the DSMS server;but rather streamed together with the data. Here; the access control policies are expressedvia security constraints (called security punctuations; or short; sps) and are embedded intodata streams. The advantages of the sp model include flexibility; dynamicity and speed of …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,63
Evaluating window joins over punctuated streams,Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract We explore join optimizations in the presence of both time-based constraints(sliding windows) and value-based constraints (punctuations). We present the first joinsolution named PWJoin that exploits such combined constraints to shrink the runtime joinstate and to propagate punctuations to benefit downstream operators. We design a statestructure for PWJoin that facilitates the exploitation of both constraint types. We also exploreoptimizations enabled by the interactions between window and punctuation; eg; earlypunctuation propagation. The costs of the PWJoin are analyzed using a cost model. We alsoconduct an experimental study using CAPE continuous query system. The experimentalresults show that in most cases; by exploiting punctuations; PWJoin outperforms the purewindow join with regard to both memory overhead and throughput.

State-slice: New paradigm of multi-query optimization of window-based stream queries,Song Wang; Elke Rundensteiner; Samrat Ganguly; Sudeept Bhatnagar,Abstract Modern stream applications such as sensor monitoring systems andpublish/subscription services necessitate the handling of large numbers of continuousqueries specified over high volume data streams. Efficient sharing of computations amongmultiple continuous queries; especially for the memory-and CPU-intensive window-basedoperations; is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing amongsimilar queries; even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews theexisting sharing methods in the literature; and then illustrates the significant performanceshortcomings of these methods. This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharingof window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grainedwindow slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,62
SCUBA: scalable cluster-based algorithm for evaluating continuous spatio-temporal queries on moving objects,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In this paper; we propose; SCUBA; a S calable C lu ster B ased A lgorithm forevaluating a large set of continuous queries over spatio-temporal data streams. The keyidea of SCUBA is to group moving objects and queries based on common spatio-temporalproperties at run-time into moving clusters to optimize query execution and thus facilitatescalability. SCUBA exploits shared cluster-based execution by abstracting the evaluation ofa set of spatio-temporal queries as a spatial join first between moving clusters. This cluster-based filtering prunes true negatives. Then the execution proceeds with a fine-grainedwithin-moving-cluster join process for all pairs of moving clusters identified as potentiallyjoinable by a positive cluster-join match. A moving cluster can serve as an approximation ofthe location of its members. We show how moving clusters can serve as means for …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,62
GBI: A generalized R-tree bulk-insertion strategy,Rupesh Choubey; Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract A lot of recent work has studied strategies related to bulk loading of large data setsinto multidimensional index structures. In this paper; we address the problem of bulkinsertions into existing index structures with particular focus on R-trees—which are animportant class of index structures used widely in commercial database systems. Wepropose a new technique; which as opposed to the current technique of inserting data oneby one; bulk inserts entire new incoming datasets into an active R-tree. This technique;called GBI (for Generalized Bulk Insertion); partitions the new datasets into sets of clustersand outliers; constructs an R-tree (small tree) from each cluster; identifies and preparessuitable locations in the original R-tree (large tree) for insertion; and lastly performs theinsertions of the small trees and the outliers into the large tree in bulk.

Individualized tutoring using an intelligent fuzzy temporal relational database,Lois Wright  Hawkes; Sharon J.  Derry; Elke A.  Rundensteiner,The student record (SR) is a major source of input for any decision making done by anIntelligent Tutoring System (ITS) and is a basis of the individualization in such systems.However; most ITSs still have “generalized” student models which represent a type ofstudent rather than a particular one. Until the SR becomes truly representative of eachindividual student; the goal of providing individualized tutoring cannot be attained. In thispaper we describe an Intelligent Fuzzy Temporal Relational Database (IFTReD); anintelligent system-independent SR which allows for almost any degree of individualizationthe designer wishes to incorporate. It is anticipated that this IFTReD will provide a significantimprovement over standard AI storage techniques for the SR. These improvements will berealized in terms of:(1) intelligence;(2) greater storage efficiency;(3) greater speed in …,International Journal of Man-Machine Studies,1990,61
XmdvTool: visual interactive data exploration and trend discovery of high-dimensional data sets,Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward; Jing Yang; Punit R Doshi,XmdvTool is a public-domain software; initiated by MO Ward in 1994; is being developed atWPI for the interactive visual exploration of multi-variate data sets [4; 1]. XmdvTool supportsan active process of discovery of patterns; trends and outliers in large-scale high-dimensional data sets. The major hurdles we overcome axe the problems of display clutter;intuitive navigation and efficient access for visual exploration over large data sets. XmdvToolincorporates several distinct display methods for multivariate data visualization that allow theusers to view data from different perspectives [4]. The displays are tightly linked; such thatvisual interactions via one display can be seamlessly refined via other displays.

Using object-oriented principles to optimize update propagation to materialized views,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,View materialization is known to be a valuable technique for performance optimization inrelational databases; and much work has been done addressing the problem of consistentlymaintaining relational views under update operations. However; little progress has beenmade thus far regarding the topic of view materialization in object-oriented databases(OODBs). In this paper; we demonstrate that there are several significant differencesbetween the relational and object-oriented paradigms that can be exploited whenaddressing the object-oriented view materialization problem. We use the subsumptionrelationships between classes to identify branches of classes to which we do not need topropagate updates. Similarly; we use encapsulated interfaces combined with the fact thatany unique database property is inherited from a single location to provide a" registration …,Data Engineering; 1996.

User interface evaluation of a direct manipulation temporal visual query language,Stacie Hibino; Elke A Rundensteiner,ABSTRACT. As new query interfaces emerge for accessing multimedia data; formal userstudies are needed to evaluate the usability of such interfaces. In this paper; we presentresults from a user interface evaluation of our temporal visual query language (TVQL). TVQLis a novel direct manipulation query interface for specifying temporal relationship queriesover temporal events such as video data. In our user study; we compare TVQL to a forms-based temporal query language (TForms). Our results indicate that while subjects tooklonger to learn TVQL than TForrns; they were more efficient and more accurate in specifyingtemporal queries with the TVQL interface than with the TForms interface.,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Multimedia,1997,55
Order-sensitive view maintenance of materialized XQuery views,Katica Dimitrova; Maged El-Sayed; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In this paper we present the first approach for incremental order-preservingmaintenance of XQuery views. Our technique is based on an algebraic representation of theXQuery view query called XAT. The XML algebra has ordered bag semantics; hence most ofthe operators logically are order preserving. We propose an order-encoding mechanism thatmigrates the XML algebra to (non-ordered) bag semantics; no longer requiring most of theoperators to be order-aware. This way operators become distributive over updateoperations. This transformation brings the problem of maintaining XML views closer to theproblem of maintaining views in other (unordered) data models. We have implemented ourview maintenance technique on top of RAINBOW; the XML data management systemdeveloped at WPI. Our experimental results confirm that incremental XML view …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2003,54
E-Cube: multi-dimensional event sequence analysis using hierarchical pattern query sharing,Mo Liu; Elke Rundensteiner; Kara Greenfield; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Ismail Ari; Abhay Mehta,Abstract Many modern applications; including online financial feeds; tag-based mass transitsystems and RFID-based supply chain management systems transmit real-time datastreams. There is a need for event stream processing technology to analyze this vast amountof sequential data to enable online operational decision making. Existing techniques suchas traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are not designed for real-timepattern-based operations; while state-of-the-art Complex Event Processing (CEP) systemsdesigned for sequence detection do not support OLAP operations. We propose a novel E-Cube model which combines CEP and OLAP techniques for efficient multi-dimensionalevent pattern analysis at different abstraction levels.

Multiversion-based view maintenance over distributed data sources,Songting Chen; Bin Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Materialized views can be maintained by submitting maintenance queries to thedata sources. However; the query results may be erroneous due to concurrent sourceupdates. State-of-the-art maintenance strategies typically apply compensations to resolvesuch conflicts and assume all source schemata remain stable over time. In a loosely coupleddynamic environment; the sources may autonomously change not only their data but alsotheir schema or semantics. Consequently; either the maintenance or the compensationqueries may be broken. Unlike compensation-based approaches found in the literature; weinstead model the complete materialized view maintenance process as a view maintenancetransaction (VM&lowbar; Transaction). This way; the anomaly problem can be rephrased asthe serializability of VM&lowbar; Transactions. To achieve VM&lowbar; Transaction …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,52
Keeping virtual information resources up and running,Amy J Lee; Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract The maintenance of materialized views in large-scale environments composed ofnumerous heterogeneous information sources (ISs); such as the WWW; has importance forthe new breed of information service providers. These applications face the problem thatsuch large-scale environments are plagued with ISs not only continuously modifying theircontents; but also their schemas and query capabilities. Current view technology assumes astatic environment; in the sense that once the underlying environment upon which the viewis defined changes its capabilities; views become undefined. This paper is the first attempt ofaddressing this problem; which we coin view synchronization. Our EVE (Evolvable ViewEnvironment) solution is capable of maintaining virtual repositories (views) undercapabilities changes of the underlying sources in situations where current view …,Proceedings of the 1997 conference of the Centre for Advanced Studies on Collaborative research,1997,51
Event stream processing with out-of-order data arrival,Ming Li; Mo Liu; Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Complex event processing has become increasingly important in modern applications;ranging from supply chain management for RFID tracking to real-time intrusion detection.The goal is to extract patterns from such event streams in order to make informed decisionsin real-time. However; networking latencies and even machine failure may cause events toarrive out-of-order at the event stream processing engine. In this work; we address theproblem of processing event pattern queries specified over event streams that may containout-of-order data. First; we analyze the problems state-of-the-art event stream processingtechnology would experience when faced with out-of-order data arrival. We then propose anew solution of physical implementation strategies for the core stream algebra operatorssuch as sequence scan and pattern construction; including stack-based data structures …,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2007.

Exploratory visualization of multivariate data with variable quality,Zaixian Xie; Shiping Huang; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Real-world data is known to be imperfect; suffering from various forms of defects such assensor variability; estimation errors; uncertainty; human errors in data entry; and gaps indata gathering. Analysis conducted on variable quality data can lead to inaccurate orincorrect results. An effective visualization system must make users aware of the quality oftheir data by explicitly conveying not only the actual data content; but also its qualityattributes. While some research has been conducted on visualizing uncertainty in spatio-temporal data and univariate data; little work has been reported on extending this capabilityinto multivariate data visualization. In this paper we describe our approach to the problem ofvisually exploring multivariate data with variable quality. As a foundation; we propose ageneral approach to defining quality measures for tabular data; in which data may …,Visual Analytics Science And Technology; 2006 IEEE Symposium On,2006,50
Active complex event processing over event streams,Di Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Richard T Ellison III,Abstract State-of-the-art Complex Event Processing technology (CEP); while effective forpattern query execution; is limited in its capability of reacting to opportunities and risksdetected by pattern queries. Especially reactions that affect the query results in turn have notbeen addressed in the literature. We propose to tackle these unsolved problems byembedding active rule support within the CEP engine; henceforth called Active CEP (ACEP).Active rules in ACEP allow us to specify a pattern query's dynamic condition and real-timeactions. The technical challenge is to handle interactions between queries and reactions toqueries in the high-volume stream execution. We hence introduce a novel stream-orientedtransactional model along with a family of stream transaction scheduling algorithms thatensure the correctness of concurrent stream execution. We demonstrate the power of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,49
Run-time operator state spilling for memory intensive long-running queries,Bin Liu; Yali Zhu; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract Main memory is a critical resource when processing long-running queries over datastreams with state intensive operators. In this work; we investigate state spill strategies thathandle run-time memory shortage when processing such complex queries by selectivelypushing operator states into disks. Unlike previous solutions which all focus on one singleoperator only; we instead target queries with multiple state intensive operators. We observean interdependency among multiple operators in the query plan when spilling operatorstates. We illustrate that existing strategies; which do not take account of thisinterdependency; become largely ineffective in this query context. Clearly; a consolidatedplan level spill strategy must be devised to address this problem. Several data spillstrategies are proposed in this paper to maximize the run-time query throughput in …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,49
Revisiting pipelined parallelism in multi-join query processing,Bin Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Multi-join queries are the core of any integration service that integrates data frommultiple distributed data sources. Due to the large number of data sources and possibly highvolumes of data; the evaluation of multi-join queries faces increasing scalability concerns.State-of-the-art parallel multi-join query processing commonly assume that the application ofmaximal pipelined parallelism leads to superior performance. In this paper; we insteadillustrate that this assumption does not generally hold. We investigate how best to combinepipelined parallelism with alternate forms of parallelism to achieve an overall effectiveprocessing strategy. A segmented bushy processing strategy is proposed. Experimentalstudies are conducted on an actual software system over a cluster of high-performance PCs.The experimental results confirm that the proposed solution leads to about 50 …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,49
Bulk-insertions into R-trees using the Small-Tree-Large-Tree approach,Li Chen; Rupesh Choubey; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract. Previous work on brdk loading data focussed at building multidimensional indexstructures jkam scratcl+ while the probIem of bdk insertions into esisting index structures hasbeen largely overlooked. In this paper; we now propme the STLT (Srnall-Tr~ Laxge-Tree)technique; which as opposed to the cument technique of inserting data one by cm% bulkinserts entire new datasets into an active R-tree. STLT considers the new dataset as an R-tree itself (small tree); identifies and prepares a suitable location in the original R-tree (largetree) for insertio~ and lastly performs the insert of the small tree into the large tree. Ourexperiments confirm that for skewed dahsets STLT consistently outperforms existingtechniques (by up to 65%) for data insertion;-whilegenerating an index structure withcomparable query retrieval performance.,Proceedings of the 6th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,1998,49
Exploration of dimensionality reduction for text visualization,Shiping Huang; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,In the text document visualization community; statistical analysis tools (eg; principalcomponent analysis and multidimensional scaling) and neurocomputation models (eg; self-organizing feature maps) have been widely used for dimensionality reduction. Often theresulting dimensionality is set to two; as this facilitates plotting the results. The validity andeffectiveness of these approaches largely depend on the specific data sets used andsemantics of the targeted applications. To date; there has been little evaluation to assessand compare dimensionality reduction methods and dimensionality reduction processes;either numerically or empirically. The focus of this paper is to propose a mechanism forcomparing and evaluating the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques in thevisual exploration of text document archives.

A design methodology for databases with uncertain data,Nauman A Chaudhry; James R Moyne; Elke A Rundensteiner,Many real world systems and applications require information management componentsthat provide support for managing imprecise data. There have thus been several proposalsfor extending relational database systems in order to represent as well as query suchimprecise data. Little work; however; has been done in modeling uncertainty at theconceptual schema level and in developing design methodologies for developing fuzzyrelational databases (FRDBs). To fill this gap; a design methodology for FRDBs is proposed.This methodology contains extensions for representing the imprecision of data in the entity-relationship (ER) data model; and a set of steps for the derivation of a FRDB from thisextended ER model. As a case study; this methodology has been applied to the design of acontrol database for semiconductor manufacturing.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1994.

InterRing: a visual interface for navigating and manipulating hierarchies,Jing Yang; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner; Anilkumar Patro,Radial; space-filling (RSF) techniques for hierarchy visualization have several advantagesover traditional node–link diagrams; including the ability to use the display space efficientlywhile effectively conveying the hierarchy structure. Several RSF systems and tools havebeen developed to date; each with varying degrees of support for interactive operationssuch as selection and navigation. In this paper; we describe what we believe to be acomplete set of desirable operations on hierarchical structures. We then present InterRing;an RSF hierarchy visualization system that supports a significantly more extensive set ofthese operations than prior systems. In particular; InterRing supports multifocus distortions;interactive hierarchy reconfiguration; and both semiautomated and manual selection.

Integrating the maintenance and synchronization of data warehouses using a cooperative framework,Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehouses (DW) are built by gathering information from several informationsources and integrating it into one repository customized to users' needs. Recently proposedview maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of (concurrent) data updates happening atdifferent autonomous ISs; whereas the EVE system addresses the maintenance of a datawarehouse after schema changes of ISs. The concurrency of schema changes and dataupdates performed by different ISs remains an unexplored problem however. This paperprovides a solution to this problem that guarantees the concurrent view definition evolutionand view extent maintenance of a DW defined over distributed ISs. To solve that problem;we introduce a framework called SDCC (Schema change and Data update ConcurrencyControl) system.

View maintenance after view synchronization,Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,While current view technology assumes that information systems (ISs) do not change theirschemas; our Evolvable View Environment (EVE) project addresses this problem byevolving the view definitions affected by IS schema changes; which we call viewsynchronization. In EVE; the view synchronizer rewrites the view definitions by replacingview components with suitable components from other ISs. However; after such a viewredefinition process; the view extents; if materialized; must also be brought up to date. In thispaper; we propose strategies to address this incremental adaptation of the view extent afterview synchronization. One key idea of our approach is to regard the complex changes doneto a view definition after synchronization as an atomic unit; another is to exploit knowledge ofhow the view definition was synchronized; especially the containment information …,Database Engineering and Applications; 1999.

Evaluating aggregates in possibilistic relational databases,Elke A Rundensteiner; Lubomir Bic,Abstract The need for extending information management systems to handle the imprecisioniof information found in the real world has been recognized. Fuzzy set theory together withpossibility theory represent a uniform framework for extending the relational database modelwith these features. However; none of the existing proposals for handling imprecision in theliterature had dealt with queries involving a functional evaluation of a set of items;traditionally refered to as aggregation. Two kinds of aggregate operators; namely; scalaraggregates and aggregate functions; exist. Both are important for most real-worldapplciations; and thus this paper presents a framework for handling these two types ofaggregates in the context of imprecise information. We consider three cases; specifically;aggregates within vague queries on precise data; aggregates within precisely specified …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1992,47
Materialized object-oriented views in MultiView,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Object-oriented view mechanisms have received much attention in the literature in recentyears; since they provide powerful mechanisms for addressing tasks such as customizedtool interfacing to object-oriented databases (OODBs) and interoperability of heterogeneousdatabases. However; little progress has been made thus far on addressing the topic of viewmaterialization in object-oriented databases. In the context of the MultiView project; we havedeveloped an object model and an accompanying set of algorithms for the support ofupdatable materialized views in OODBs. We take advantage of unique features of theMultiView model; including its support for object-preserving queries; the integration of baseand virtual classes into a unified and consistent global class hierarchy; and an object-slicingapproach.

An algebraic approach for incremental maintenance of materialized XQuery views,Maged El-Sayed; Ling Wang; Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Modern data sources; including structural and semi-structural sources; often exportXML views over base data; and at times may materialize their views by storing the XMLquery result to provide faster data access. It is typically more efficient to maintain a view byincrementally propagating the base changes to the view than by re-computing it fromscratch. Techniques for the incremental maintenance of relational views have beenextensively studied in the literature. However; the maintenance of views created usingXQuery is as of now unexplored. In this paper we propose an algebraic approach forincremental XQuery view maintenance. In our approach; an update to the XML source istransformed into a set of well defined update primitives which are propagated through theXML algebra tree.

A transactional model for data warehouse maintenance,Jun Chen; Songting Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract A Data Warehouse Management System (DWMS) incrementally maintainsmaterialized views by issuing maintenance queries to the data sources. To addresserroneous query results caused by concurrent source updates; state-of-the-art maintenancestrategies typically apply compensations to resolve the conflicts. For this; they assumehowever that the source schema are not updated and remain stable over time. However; ifschema changes occur in any of the sources; then an anomaly may arise; namely; themaintenance or the compensation queries may be broken. We now tackle this open problemby modeling the complete maintenance process as a special transaction; called aDWMSTransaction. The anomaly problem can now be rephrased as the serializability ofDWMSTransactions. This allows us to apply well-established transaction theory to …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2002,42
Hierarchical Path Views: A Model Based on Fragmentation and Transportation Road Types.,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract E cient path query processing necessary for route guidance has been identi ed asone of the key requirements for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. Whileprecomputing the view of all shortest paths provides the most e cient path retrieval; the viewmaintenance and storage costs become unrealistic for large ITS networks. Based on ITSroad type classi cation; we propose a hierarchical path view approach; in which the pathview maintenance and storage costs are dramatically reduced at the cost of negligible lossof path optimality. Comparing with the traditional ITS path nding approaches that use A orhierarchical A; our hierarchical approach is superior in three areas: 1) path search is more ecient; 2) the connecting point from the low-level roads to the high-level roads and vice versaare dynamically determined based on the most recent tra c; 3) within one region; the high …,ACM-GIS,1995,40
A visual multimedia query language for temporal analysis of video data,Stacie Hibino; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract The storage of various media in multimedia databases poses new challenges toquery techniques—challenges that exceed the expressive power of traditional text-basedquery languages. New query interfaces should take advantage of characteristics inherent inmultimedia data; such as the dynamic temporal nature of video; the visual and spatialcharacteristics of images; the pitch of audio; etc. The focus of our research is to exploit thetemporal continuity and combined spatio-temporal characteristics of video data for thepurpose of video analysis. We do so by integrating a visual query paradigm with a dynamicvisual presentation of results into a user-friendly interactive visualization environment.

A classification algorithm for supporting object-oriented views,Elke Angelika Rundensteiner,Abstract In recent years; object-oriented (OO) views have been recognized as a powerfulmechanism for customizing the structural as well as behavioral aspects of interfaces toobject-oriented databases (OODBs) for diverse users. In this context; classification isconcerned with the integration of virtual classes derived using an OO query into one unifyingschema. Existing approaches either require the user to explicitly specify the relationshipbetween a virtual class and existing base classes; or they relate a virtual class directly withits source class (es) or with the root of the schema. In this paper; we propose a solution tothis classification problem that accomplishes the following goals:(1) generate maximallyinformative; and thus comprehensible; schemas that explicitly model the subclassrelationships between base and virtual classes; and (2) support efficient type resolution …,Proceedings of the third international conference on Information and knowledge management,1994,39
High-performance nested CEP query processing over event streams,Mo Liu; Elke Rundensteiner; Dan Dougherty; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Ismail Ari; Abhay Mehta,Complex event processing (CEP) over event streams has become increasingly important forreal-time applications ranging from health care; supply chain management to businessintelligence. These monitoring applications submit complex queries to track sequences ofevents that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need for increasinglycomplex nested sequence query support arises; while the state-of-art CEP systems mostlysupport the execution of flat sequence queries only. To assure real-time responsiveness andscalability for pattern detection even on huge volume high-speed streams; efficientprocessing techniques must be designed. In this paper; we first analyze the prevailingnested pattern query processing strategy and identify several serious shortcomings. Not onlyare substantial subsequences first constructed just to be subsequently discarded; but also …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,38
Consistently updating XML documents using incremental constraint check queries,Bintou Kane; Hong Su; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract When updating a valid XML document; an efficient yet light-weight mechanism isneeded to determine if the up-date would invalidate the document. Towards this goal; wedeveloped a framework called SAXE; we first analyzed the constraints expressed in XMLschema specifications and establish constraint rules that must be observed for an XMLdocument to conform to a given XML Schema. We then classify the rules as relevant for agiven update case; that is; we show the minimal set of rules that must be checked toguarantee the safety for each given update primitive. Next; we illustrate that this set ofincremental constraint checks can be specified using generic XQuery expressionscomposed of three components. These components are (1) XML schema meta-queries toretrieve any constraint knowledge potentially relevant to the given update;(2) retrieval of …,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Web information and data management,2002,38
Argos: Efficient refresh in an XQL-based web caching system,Luping Quan; Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract The Web has become a major conduit to information repositories of all kinds. Webcaches are employed to store web views to provide an immediate response to recurringqueries. However; the accuracy of the replicates in web caches encounters challenges dueto the dynamicity of web data. We are thus developing and evaluating a web caching systemequipped with an efficient refresh strategy. With the assistance of a novel index structure-theAggregation Path Index (APIX); we built Argos; a web caching system based on the GMDXQL query engine. Argos achieves a high degree of self-maintenance by diagnosingirrelevant data update cases. It hence greatly improves the refresh performance of thematerialized web view. We also report preliminary experimental results assessing theperformance of Argos compared to the state-of-the-art solution in the literature.,International Workshop on the World Wide Web and Databases,2000,38
Updating XML views published over relational databases: Towards the existence of a correct update mapping,Ling Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract XML data management using relational database systems has been intensivelystudied in the last few years. However; in order for such systems to be viable; they mustsupport not only queries; but also updates over virtual XML views that wrap the relationaldata. While view updating is a long-standing difficult issue in the relational context; theflexible XML data model and nested XML query language both pose additional challengesfor view updating. This paper addresses the question; if for a given update over an XMLview; a correct relational update translation exists. First; we propose a clean extended-source theory as criteria for determining whether a given translation mapping is correct. Todetermine the existence of such a correct mapping; we classify a view update as either un-translatable; conditionally or unconditionally translatable under a given update translation …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,37
A dynamically adaptive distributed system for processing complex continuous queries,Bin Liu; Yali Zhu; Mariana Jbantova; Bradley Momberger; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Recent years have witnessed rapidly growing research attention on continuousquery processing over streams [2; 3]. A continuous query system can easily run out ofresources in case of large amount of input stream data. Distributed continuous queryprocessing over a shared nothing architecture; ie; a cluster of machines; has beenrecognized as a scalable method to solve this problem [2; 8; 9]. Due to the lack of initial costinformation and the fluctuating nature of the streaming data; uneven workload amongmachines may occur and this may impair the benefits of distributed processing. Thusdynamic adaptation techniques are crucial for a distributed continuous query system.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,37
XAT: XML Algebra for the Rainbow system,Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract XML is the de facto standard for storing and exchanging data between differentapplications. More and more data is being published in the XML format and thus availablefor further querying and management. Recently; World Wide Web Consortium proposed anew standard XML query language called XQuery. Several procedure-based queryinterpreter for XQuery have been proposed; most notably Kweelt. We are developingRainbow; an XML data management system; that at its core has an algebra based XQueryquery engine. The XML algebra; which we have developed in the Rainbow project is calledXML Algebra Tree (XAT). This XAT has been designed with two primary goals namelyquerying both relational data and also querying native XML data. This algebra represents asolid foundation for query optimization; computation pushdown; query rewrite; different …,*,2002,37
A visual query language for identifying temporal trends in video data,Stacie Hibino; Elke A Rundensteiner,Video is becoming a popular medium for data collection. The challenge of analyzing videodata is to abstract and conclude quantitative results from such a rich; qualitative medium.The focus of our research is to support video analysis by developing a user-friendlyinteractive visualization environment to query video data using spatio-temporalcharacteristics and to review visual results for trend analysis. We present our approach foridentifying temporal trends in video data via querying for relationships between videoannotations. Our approach allows users to analyze the video in terms of temporalrelationships between events (eg; events of type B frequently follow events of type A). Wepresent a temporal visual query language for specifying relative temporal queries betweensets of annotations.

Aggregates in possibilistic databases,Elke A Rundensteiner; Lubomir Bic,Abstract Fuzzy set theory represents a uniform framework for extending the relationaldatabase model to handle imprecision of information found in the real world. None of theexisting proposals for data models handling imprecision has dealt with queries involvingaggregate operators. This paper presents a framework for handling aggregates in thecontext of imprecise information. Two kinds of aggregates; namely; scalar aggregates andaggregate functions; are being supported. We consider three cases: aggregates withinapproximate queries on precise data; aggregates within precisely specified queries onpossibilistic data; and aggregates within vague queries on imprecise data. These extensionsare based on fuzzy set-theoretical concepts such as the extension principle and thepossibilistic expected value.,Proc. Conf. Very Large Databases,1989,36
Scalable distance-based outlier detection over high-volume data streams,Lei Cao; Di Yang; Qingyang Wang; Yanwei Yu; Jiayuan Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,The discovery of distance-based outliers from huge volumes of streaming data is critical formodern applications ranging from credit card fraud detection to moving object monitoring. Inthis work; we propose the first general framework to handle the three major classes ofdistance-based outliers in streaming environments; including the traditional distance-threshold based and the nearest-neighbor-based definitions. Our LEAP frameworkencompasses two general optimization principles applicable across all three outlier types.First; our “minimal probing” principle uses a lightweight probing operation to gather minimalyet sufficient evidence for outlier detection. This principle overturns the state-of-the-artmethodology that requires routinely conducting expensive complete neighborhood searchesto identify outliers. Second; our “lifespan-aware prioritization” principle leverages the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,35
Updating XQuery views published over relational data: A round-trip case study,Ling Wang; Mukesh Mulchandani; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Managing XML data using relational database systems; including query processingover virtual XML views that wrap relational sources; has been heavily studied in the last fewyears. Updating such virtual XML views; however; is not well studied; although it is essentialfor building a viable full-featured XML data management systems. XML view update is achallenging problem because of having to address the mismatch between the two ratherdifferent data models and distinct query paradigms. In this paper; we tackle the XQuery viewupdate problem; in particular; we focus on the round-trip XML view update subproblem. Thiscase; characterized by a pair of loading and extraction mappings that load XML data into therelational store and extract appropriate XML views; is very common in practice; as manyapplications utilize a relational engine for XML document storage.

Discovery of high-dimensional inclusion dependencies,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Determining relationships such as functional or inclusion dependencies within and acrossdatabases is important for many applications in information integration. When suchinformation is not available as explicit meta data; it is possible to discover potentialdependencies from the source database extents. However; the complexity of such discoveryproblems is typically exponential in the number of attributes. We have developed analgorithm for the discovery of inclusion dependencies across high-dimensional relations inthe order of 100 attributes. This algorithm is the first to efficiently solve the inclusion-dependency discovery problem. This is achieved by mapping it into a progressive series ofclique-finding problems in k-uniform hypergraphs and solving those. Extensive experimentalstudies confirm the algorithm's efficiency on a variety of real-world data sets.,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,34
OQL_SERF: an ODMG implementation of the template-based schema evolution framework,Kajal T Claypool; Jing Jin; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract With rapid progress in application development and technologies; there is anincreasing need to specify and handle complex schema changes of databases. The existingsupport for schema evolution in current OODB systems is limited to a pre-defined taxonomyof simple schema evolution operations with fixed semantics. We have proposed anextensible framework for schema transformations to address this open problem. The SERFframework succeeds in giving the user the flexibility to define the semantics of their choice;the extensibility of defining new complex transformations; and the power of re-using thesetransformations through the notion of templates. In this paper; we now report on OQL-SERF;the realization of our concepts based on the ODMG standard.

Set operations in object-based data models,Elke A.  Rundensteiner; Lubomir Bic,The semantics of set operations are not adequate for the richer data models of object-baseddatabase systems that include object-oriented and semantic data modeling concepts. Thereason is that precise semantics of set operations on complex objects require a cleardistinction between the dual notions of a set and a type; both of which are present in theclass construct found in object-based data models. This gap is filled here by a framework forexecuting set theoretic operations on the class construct. The proposed set operations;including set difference; union; intersection and symmetric difference; determine both thetype description of the derived class as well as its set membership. For the former;inheritance rules are developed for property characteristics such as single-valued versusmultivalued and required versus optional. For the latter; the object identity concept is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1992,34

However; we observe that interactive visualexplorations exhibit several properties that can be exploited for data access optimization;including locality of exploration; contiguous queries; and significant delays between useroperations. We thus apply semantic caching of active query sets on the client side to exploitsome of the above characteristics.

Augmented inherited multi-index structure for maintenance of materialized path query views,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Materialized complex object-oriented views are a promising technique for the integration ofheterogeneous databases and the development of powerful data warehousing systems.Path query views are virtual classes formed from selection queries that specify a predicateupon the value of an aggregation hierarchy path. The primary difference between previouswork regarding OODB indexing and the efficient implementation of materialized path queryviews addressed in this paper lies in the nature of their usage. For OODB indexing; queryusage is the primary purpose of index structures. Because the materialized view data itselfcan be used to answer queries; the primary use of index structures with regard tomaterialized path query views is for the incremental maintenance of views in the face ofupdates. We have developed an augmented inherited multi-index (AIM) strategy that is …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1996. Interoperability of Nontraditional Database Systems. Proceedings.

The object-slicing technique: A flexible object representation and its evaluation,Harumi A Kuno; Young-Gook Ra; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Recently much work has been done towards extending object-oriented databasesystems (OODBs) with advanced tools such as view technology; advanced schemaevolution support; and role modeling systems. These extensions all require that theunderlying database system supports more powerful and exible modeling constructs thanare currently supported by existing OODB systems. In this paper; we identify these featuresas multiple classi cation; dynamic reclassi cation; and dynamic restructuring. We thendescribe a methodology known as object-slicing that is capable of extending data models tosupport these required features.

StreamShield: a stream-centric approach towards security and privacy in data stream environments,Rimma V Nehme; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract We propose to demonstrate the StreamShield; a system designed to address theproblem of security and privacy in the context of Data Stream Management Systems(DSMSs). In StreamShield; continuous access control is enforced by taking a novel" stream-centric" approach towards security. Security policies are not persistently stored on theserver; but rather are depicted by security metadata; called" security punctuations"; and getembedded into streams together with the data. We distinguish between two types of securitypunctuations:(1) the" data security punctuations"(dsps) describing the data-side securitypolicies; and (2) the" query security punctuations"(qsps) representing the query-side securitypolicies. The advantages of such stream-centric security model include flexibility; dynamicityand speed of enforcement.

Parallel multisource view maintenance,Xin Zhang; Lingli Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In a distributed environment; materialized views are used to integrate data fromdifferent information sources and then store them in some centralized location. In order tomaintain such materialized views; maintenance queries need to be sent to informationsources by the data warehouse management system. Due to the independence of theinformation sources and the data warehouse; concurrency issues are raised between themaintenance queries and the local update transactions at each information source. Recentsolutions such as ECA and Strobe tackle such concurrent maintenance; however with therequirement of quiescence of the information sources. SWEEP and POSSE overcome thislimitation by decomposing the global maintenance query into smaller subqueries to be sentto every information source and then performing conflict correction locally at the data …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2004,31

Gpivot: Efficient incremental maintenance of complex rolap views,Songting Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) are essential for decisionsupport applications. Common OLAP operations include for example drill down; roll up; pivotand unpivot. Typically; such queries are fairly complex and are often executed over hugevolumes of data. The solution in practice is to use materialized views to reduce the querycost. Utilizing materialized views that incorporate not just traditional simple SELECT-PROJECT-JOIN operators but also complex OLAP operators such as pivot and unpivot iscrucial to improve the OLAP query performance but as of now unexplored topic. In this work;we demonstrate that the efficient maintenance of views with pivot and unpivot operatorsrequires the definition of more generalized operators; which we call GPIVOT andGUNPIVOT.

Progressive result generation for multi-criteria decision support queries,Venkatesh Raghavan; Elke A Rundensteiner,Multi-criteria decision support (MCDS) is crucial in many business and web applicationssuch as web searches; B2B portals and on-line commerce. Such MCDS applications needto report results early; as soon as they are being generated so that they can react andformulate competitive decisions in near real-time. The ease in expressing user preferencesin web-based applications has made Pareto-optimal (skyline) queries a popular class ofMCDS queries.

In this paper; given a Web view specified in XQL; we proposean aggregation path index structure to hold a collection of" qualified" objects with respect tothe query pattern. By utilizing the pre-computed auxiliary information stored in such anindex; our algorithms show that Web view maintenance can be done more efficiently.

We present a visualquery language (SVIQUEL) which allows us to specify the relative spatial position (bothtopology and direction) between objects using direct manipulation of spatial query filters;called S-sliders. The S-sliders for the selection of precise numeric ranges for querydimensions are complimented by Active-Picture-for-Querying (APIQ); a qualitativedirectmanipulation query paradigm.

Semantic query optimization in an automata-algebra combined XQuery engine over XML streams,Hong Su; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Our Raindrop framework [6; 9] aims at tackling challenges of stream processing that areparticular to XML. In contrast to the tuple-based or object-based data streams; XML streamsare usually modeled as a sequence of primitive tokens; such as a start tag; an end tag or aPCDATA item. Unlike a self-contained tuple or object whose semantics are completelydetermined by its own values; a token lacks semantics without the context provided by othertokens in the stream. This poses specific challenges for query processing over such XMLstreams. State-of-the-Art. Since the automata model was originally designed for matchingpatterns over strings; it is a natural paradigm for structural pattern retrieval on XML tokenstreams [7; 8; 4]. However the automata model suffers from not being able to strike a balancebetween the expressive power of the query it can handle and the manageability of its …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,27
Raindrop: a uniform and layered algebraic framework for XQueries on XML streams,Hong Su; Jinhui Jian; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract XML stream applications bring the challenge of efficiently processing queries onsequentially accessible token-based data. While the automata model is naturally suited forpattern matching on tokenized XML streams; the algebraic model in contrast is a well-established technique for set-oriented processing of self-contained tuples. However; neitherautomata nor algebraic models are well-equipped to handle both computation paradigms.The goal of the Raindrop project is to accommodate these two paradigms within onealgebraic framework to take advantage of both. In our query model; both tokenized data andself-contained tuples are supported in a uniform manner. Query plans can be flexiblyrewritten using equivalence rules to change what computation is done using tokenized dataversus tuples.

XEM: XML evolution management,Hong Su; Diane K Kramer; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract XML has been emerging as a standard format for data representation on the web. Inmany application domains; specific document type definitions (DTDs) are designed toenforce the structure (schema) of the XML documents. However; both the data and thestructure of XML documents tend to change over time for a multitude of reasons; including tocorrect design errors in the DTD; to allow expansion of the application scope over time; or toaccount for environmental changes such as the merging of several businesses into one.Most of the current software tools that enable the use of XML do not provide explicit supportfor such data or schema changes. Using these tools in a changing environment entails firstmaking manual edits to DTDs and XML documents and thereafter reloading them fromscratch.

DyDa: data warehouse maintenance in fully concurrent environments,Jun Chen; Xin Zhang; Songting Chen; Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Introduction. Xodern data integration environments integrate heterogeneous andautonomous information sources (ISs); so that those sources may change without beingcontrolled from a higher data integration layer. In such an environment; source changes fromdifferent ISs can occur concurrently; and both data and schema changes are possible. Wedistinguish between three types of tasks of data warehouse (DW) maintenance in dynamicenvironments. View maintenance (VX) incrementally maintains the view extents under dataupdates; assuming the views have been materialized at the DW. View synchronization (VS)evolves the view definition kept at the DW when a source schema has been changed. Viewadaptation (VA) adapts the view extent after the view definition has been modified.

Evolvable view environment (EVE): non-equivalent view maintenance under schema changes,Elke A Rundensteiner; Andreas Koeller; Xin Zhang; Amy J Lee; Anisoara Nica; A Van Wyk; Y Lee,Abstract Supporting independent ISs and integrating them in distributed data warehouses(materialized views) is becoming more important with the growth of the WWW. However;views defined over autonomous ISs are susceptible to schema changes. In the EVE projectwe are developing techniques to support the maintenance of data warehouses defined overdistributed dynamic ISs [5; 6; 7]. The EVE system is the first to allow views to survive schemachanges of their underlying ISs while also adapting to changing data in those sources. EVEachieves this is two steps: applying view query rewriting algorithms that exploit informationabout alternative ISs and the information they contain; and incrementally adapting the viewextent to the view definition changes. Those processes are referred to as viewsynchronization and view adaption; respectively. They increase the survivability of …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,27
Improving spatial intersect joins using symbolic intersect detection,Yun-Wu Huang; Matthew Jones; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract We introduce a novel technique to drastically reduce the computation required bythe refinement step during spatial intersect join processing. This technique; called SymbolicIntersect Detection (SID); detects most of the true hits during a spatial intersect join byscrutinizing symbolic topological relationships between candidate polygon pairs. SID boostsperformance by detecting true hits early during the refinement step; thus avoiding expensivepolygon intersect computations that would otherwise be required to detect the true hits. Ourexperimental evaluation with real GIS map data demonstrates that SID can identify morethan 80% of the true hits with only minimal overhead. Consequently; SID outperforms knowntechniques for resolving polygon intersection during the refinement step by more than 50%.Most state-of-the-art methods in spatial join processing can benefit from SID's …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1997,27
Integrated query processing strategies for spatial path queries,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Investigates optimization strategies for processing path queries with embedded spatialconstraints; such as avoiding areas with certain characteristics. To resolve complex spatialconstraints during path finding; we consider two decisions:(1) the spatial relation operations(eg intersection) between areas and links can be pre-processed or intermixed with path-finding; and (2) areas satisfying the query constraint can be pre-filtered or dynamicallyselected during path-finding. Based on these two decisions; we propose and implement theresulting four integrated query processing strategies; utilizing state-of-the-art technologiessuch as spatial joins for intersect computation; R-tree access structure for spatial overlapsearching; and spatial clustering for efficient path searching. In this paper; we also report anexperimental evaluation to show which strategies perform best in different scenarios.,Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings. 13th International Conference on,1997,27
MJoin: a metadata-aware stream join operator,Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner; George T Heineman,Abstract Join algorithms must be re-designed when processing stream data instead ofpersistently stored data. Data streams are potentially infinite and the query result is expectedto be generated incrementally instead of once only. Data arrival patterns are oftenunpredictable and the statistics of the data and other relevant metadata often are only knownat runtime. In some cases they are supplied interleaved with the actual data in the form ofstream markers. Recently; stream join algorithms; like Symmetric Hash Join and XJoin; havebeen designed to perform in a pipelined fashion to cope with the latent delivery of data.However; none of them to date takes metadata; especially runtime metadata; intoconsideration. Hence; the join execution logic defined statically before runtime may not bewell suited to deal with varying types of dynamic runtime scenarios.

Rainbow: mapping-driven XQuery processing system,Xin Zhang; Mukesh Mulchandani; Steffen Christ; Brian Murphy; Elke A Rundensteiner,Rainbow System. We have developed an XML repository management system; calledRainbow; designed to exploit relational database technology to manage XML data based ona flexible mapping strategy [2]. As shown in Figure 1; the Rainbow system is composed ofthree sub-systems; eg; a loading manager; a mapping manager; and an XML query enginebuild on top of a relational database. Rainbow first loads an XML Schema into the relationaldatabase via the loading query provided by the loading manager. Loading queries areexpressed in XQuery. Then the mapping manager provides an extraction view querygenerated from the loading query. The XML query engine accepts an XML query or an XMLupdate request from the user in an extended XQuery syntax. It then combines the user'srequest with the extraction view; pushes down as much computation as possible to the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,26
PVM: Parallel View Maintenance under Concurrent Data Updates of Distributed Sources⋆,Xin Zhang; Lingli Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehouses (DW) are built by gathering information from distributedinformation sources (ISs) and integrating it into one customized repository. In recent years;work has begun to address the problem of view maintenance of DWs under concurrent dataupdates of different ISs. The SWEEP solution is one solution that does not require the ISs tobe quiescence; as required by previous strategies; by employing a local compensationstrategy. SWEEP however processes all update messages in a sequential manner. Tooptimize upon this sequential processing; we now propose a parallel view maintenancealgorithm; called PVM; that incorporates all benefits of previous maintenance approacheswhile offering improved performance due to parallelism. We have identified two issuescritical for supporting parallel view maintenance:(1) detecting maintenance-concurrent …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2001,26
Clock: Synchronizing Internal Relational Storage with External XML Documents,Xin Zhang; Gail Mitchell; Wang-Chien Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner,In many business settings; a relational database system (RDBMS) will serve as the storagemanager for data from XML documents. In such a system; once the XML data is dissembledand loaded into the storage system; XML queries posed against the (virtual) XML documentsare processed by translating them into SQL queries against the relational storage. However;for applications which frequently update their XML documents; we cannot afford to reload acomplete; possibly large; document for each update; instead we must be able toincrementally propagate document updates to the stored XML data. We address the issue ofcorrectly reflecting updates of external XML documents into the loaded XML data in arelational database system. We describe Clock; a framework for synchronizing the relationalstorage with updated XML documents by exploiting a metadata-driven technology. First …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2001.

The MultiView project: object-oriented view technology and applications,Elke A Rundensteiner; Harumi A Kuno; Y-G Ra; Viviane Crestana-Taube; Matthew C Jones; Pedro José Marrón,The MultiView Project is an on-going 5-year NFS-ftrnded effort at the University of Michiganto develop and apply object-oriented view technology to address the needs of recentlyemerging applications such as data warehousing and workflow management systems thatrequire the sharing; virtual restructuring; and caching of data [5]. Through Multi-View; userscan dynamically create and modify virtual classes and schemata at any time(Figure 1).MultiView; which is fully implemented on top of the GemStone OODB; is one of the firstsystems to provide updatable and incrementally maintained materialized object-orientedviews [1; 5].,ACM SIGMOD Record,1996,26
An optimal strategy for monitoring top-k queries in streaming windows,Di Yang; Avani Shastri; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Continuous top-k queries; which report a certain number (k) of top preferred objectsfrom data streams; are important for a broad class of real-time applications; ranging fromfinancial analysis to network traffic monitoring. Existing solutions for tackling this problemaim to reduce the computational costs by incrementally updating the top-k results upon eachwindow slide. However; they all suffer from the performance bottleneck of periodicallyrequiring a complete recomputation of the top-k results from scratch. Such an operation isnot only computationally expensive but also causes significant memory consumption; as itrequires keeping all objects alive in the query window. To solve this problem; we identifythe" Minimal Top-K candidate set"(MTK); namely the subset of stream objects that is bothnecessary and sufficient for continuous top-k monitoring. Based on this theoretical …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,25

XmdvTool Q;makes quality or lack thereof explicit for all stages of the data exploration process from rawdata; to abstracted data; to the final visual displays; allowing users to query and navigatethrough data-; structure-and quality-spaces.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,25
A compensation-based approach for view maintenance in distributed environments,Songting Chen; Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Data integration over multiple heterogeneous data sources has become increasinglyimportant for modern applications. The integrated data is usually stored as materializedviews to allow better access; performance; and high availability. In loosely coupledenvironments; such as the data grid; the data sources are autonomous. Hence; tie sourceupdates can be concurrent and cause erroneous results during view maintenance. State-of-the-art maintenance strategies apply compensating queries to correct such errors; makingthe restricting assumption that all source schemata remain static over time. However; in suchdynamic environments; the data sources may change not only their data but also theirschema. Consequently; either the maintenance queres or the compensating queries mayfail. In this paper; we propose a novel framework called DyDa that overcomes these …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,25
Efficiently supporting order in XML query processing,Maged El-Sayed; Katica Dimitrova; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract XML is an ordered data model and XQuery expressions return results that have awell-defined order. However; little work on how order is supported in XML query processinghas been done to date. In this paper we study the issues related to handling order in theXML context; namely challenges imposed by the XML data model; the variety of orderrequirements of the XQuery language; and the need to maintain order in the presence ofupdates to the XML data. We propose an efficient solution that addresses all these issues.Our solution is based on a key encoding for XML nodes that serves as node identity and atthe same time encodes order. We design rules for encoding order of processed XML nodesbased on the XML algebraic query execution model and the node key encoding. Theserules do not require any actual sorting for intermediate results during execution. Our …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,25
Gangam: A transformation modeling framework,Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Integration of multiple heterogeneous data sources continues to be a critical problem formany application domains and a challenge for researchers world-wide. One aspect ofintegration is the translation of schema and data across data model boundaries.Researchers in the past have looked at both customized algorithmic approaches as well asgeneric meta-modeling approaches as viable solutions. We now take the meta-modelingapproach the next step-forward. In this paper we propose a flexible; extensible and re-usable transformation modeling framework which allows users to (1) model theirtransformations;(2) to choose from a set of possible execution strategies to translate theunderlying schema and data; and (3) to access and re-use a library of transformationgenerators.

Data warehouses evolution: trade-offs between quality and cost of query rewritings,Amy J Lee; Andreas Koeller; Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,Query rewriting with relaxed semantics has been proposed as a means of retaining thevalidity of a data warehouse (ie; materialized queries) in a changing environment. Attributesin the query interface can be classified as essential or dispensable (if it cannot be retained)according to the query definer's preferences. Similarly; preferences for query extent can bespecified; for example; to indicate whether a subset of the original result is acceptable or not.The paper discusses the trade-off between quality and cost of query rewriting.,Data Engineering; 1999.

Integrating the rewriting and ranking phases of view synchronization,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner; Nabil Hachem,Abstract Material&d views (data warehouses) are becoming increasingly important in thecontext of distributed modem environments such as the World Wide Web. Informationsources (I%) in such an environment may change their capabilities (schema); causing a datawarehouse to become undefined. This process to evolve (rewrite) view queries aftercapability changes of ISs is referred to ss view synchronization. Current viewsynchronization algorithms generate a potentially large number of valid solutions for therewriting of a view query and according to our analysis in this paper have high complexity (inO (n!)). We propose to reduce this complexity by representing the synchronization problemas a graph traversal problem. Once this mapping has been applied; the problem can bereduced to a single-source shortestpath problem in graphs; which can be solved with O …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,1998,25
Active Controller: utilizing active databases for implementing multistep control of semiconductor manufacturing,Nauman Chaudhry; James Moyne; Elke A Rundensteiner,Whenever the fabrication process consists of several steps and the dynamic modification ofindividual steps or step sequences of the process is allowed; multistep feedback and feed-forward control can be utilized to improve the quality of the fabrication process. In this paper;we describe the Active Controller-an adaptable and portable software enabler for multistepcontrol in manufacturing facilities. The Active Controller utilizes a recently emergingtechnology; called active databases; to define and automatically execute powerful andexpressive rules for implementing multistep control algorithms. The conditions of ActiveController rules are defined to check for scenarios in which multistep control is needed. TheActive Controller keeps track of relevant processing events and data; and when theconditions for multistep control hold; executes appropriate actions to compensate for the …,IEEE Transactions on Components; Packaging; and Manufacturing Technology: Part C,1998,25
A semi-materialized view approach for route guidance in intelligent vehicle highway systems,Yun-Wu Huang; Yun-wu Huangy; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Efficient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identified as oneof the key requirements for Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) applications. Whilethe current IVHS literature has focused on the application of search algorithms (typically;heuristic A* algorithms) to provide for compute-on-demand path finding; we propose a semi-materialized path view approach that pre-computes optimal paths. Advantages of ourapproach include (1) route computation is very efficient and no longer dependent on thenumber of route requests and (2) the storage overhead is less than for the full enumerationof all possible paths. In this paper; we present algorithms for incrementally updating theencoded path view structure in response to weight changes on the traffic links of theunderlying network; eg; a slower link traversal time; a congestion; etc. Our algorithms are …,*,1994,25
MASS: a multi-axis storage structure for large XML documents,Kurt Deschler; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract Effective indexing for XML must consider both the query requirements of the XPathlanguage and the dynamic nature of XML. We introduce MASS; a Multiple Axis StorageStructure; to provide scalable indexing for XPath expressions with guaranteed updateperformance. We describe the building blocks of MASS and provide results that demonstrateMASS's scalability. We show that MASS can outperform other state-of-the-art XML indexingsolutions; even with constrained system resources.,Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2003,24
Processing incremental multidimensional range queries in a direct manipulation visual query environment,Stacie Hibino; Elke A Rundensteiner,We have developed a MultiMedia Visual Information Seeking (MMVIS) Environmentdesigned to support an integrated approach to direct manipulation temporal querying andbrowsing of temporal relationship results. We address the optimization of queries specifiedvia our visual query interface. Queries in MMVIS are incrementally specified andcontinuously refined multidimensional range queries. We present our k-Array index structureand its bucket based counterpart; the k-Bucket; as new indexes optimized for processingthese direct manipulation queries. In an experimental evaluation comparing our k-Array andk-Bucket solutions to alternate techniques from the literature; we show that the k-Bucketperforms generally equal to or better than the other techniques and is the best overallapproach for such environments.,Data Engineering; 1998.

Managing discoveries in the visual analytics process,Di Yang; Zaixian Xie; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Visualization systems traditionally focus on graphical representation of information.They tend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tacklingcomplex knowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usuallyimpeded due to several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when toomuch data is visualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize theirdiscoveries off line; because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3)their discoveries based on visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; and 4) they have noconvenient access to the important knowledge learned by other users. To tackle theseproblems; it has been recognized that analytical tools must be introduced into visualizationsystems.

Detection and correction of conflicting source updates for view maintenance,Songting Chen; Jun Chen; Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Data integration over multiple heterogeneous data sources has become increasinglyimportant for modern applications. The integrated data is usually stored in materializedviews for high availability and better performance. Such views must be maintained after thedata sources change. In a loosely-coupled and dynamic environment; such as the Data Grid;the sources may autonomously change not only their data but also their schema; querycapabilities or semantics; which may consequently cause the ongoing view maintenancefail. We analyze the maintenance errors and classify them into different classes ofdependencies. We then propose several dependency detection and correction algorithms tohandle these new classes of concurrency. Our techniques are not tied to specificmaintenance algorithms nor to a particular data model. To our knowledge; this is the first …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Selectivity estimation in the presence of alphanumeric correlations,Min Wang; Jeffrey Scott Vitter; Bala Iyer,Query optimization is an integral part of relational database management systems. Oneimportant task in query optimization is selectivity estimation; that is; given a query P; oneneeds to estimate the fraction of records in the database that satisfy P. Almost all previouswork dealt with the estimation of numeric selectivity; ie; the query contains only numericvariables. The general problem of estimating alphanumeric selectivity is much more difficultand has attracted attention only very recently; and the focus has been on the special casewhen only one column is involved. The authors consider the more general case when thereare two correlated alphanumeric columns. They develop efficient algorithms to build storagestructures that can fit in a database catalog.

Evaluation of hierarchical path finding techniques for ITS route guidance,Yun-Wu Huang; EA Rundensteiner; N Jing,Efficient path finding necessary for route guidance has been identified as one of the keyrequirements for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. Precomputing all-pairshortest paths for an ITS network would make retrieval of paths extremely efficient allowing ahigh throughput of path finding requests; though at the cost of precomputed pathmaintenance and storage. To overcome these costs; which grow quadratically with the sizeof the ITS networks; we propose the utilization of a hierarchical structure for encoding paths.The main contributions of this paper are two fold. First; an extensive experimental evaluationof our proposed hierarchical path structure; determining both its benefits and limitations aswell as contrasting it with alternative techniques currently employed for ITS route guidance isconducted and analyzed. Secondly; we apply our hierarchical path structure model to the …,Intelligent Transportation: Realizing the Benefits. Proceedings of the 1996 Annual Meeting of ITS America. ITS America,1996,23
Design tool integration using object-oriented database views,Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract CAD systems utilize a central design database(DDB) to achieve the much neededintegration of diverse design information into one model. A global DDB represents a seriousbottleneck for the CAD system; it prevents the extensibility of the CAD system over time andforces all design tools to work on the same comprehensive data model. As a solution; wepropose to utilize the object-oriented view mechanism; called Multi View; for declarativelyspecifying customized tool interfaces(design views) on the CAD database. A design viewcontains a subset of relevant information from the DDB organized in a fashion most suitableto the needs of a particular tool. Multi View automatically maintains the mapping betweenthe global data model and local design views; thus freeing individual design tools from thisburden. The resulting CAD environment assures the consistent integration of design data …,Proceedings of the 1993 IEEE/ACM international conference on Computer-aided design,1993,23

Multi-route query processing and optimization,Rimma V Nehme; Karen Works; Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A modern query optimizer typically picks a single query plan for all data based onoverall data statistics. However; many have observed that real-life datasets tend to have non-uniform distributions. Selecting a single query plan may result in ineffective query executionfor possibly large portions of the actual data. In addition most stream query processingsystems; given the volume of data; cannot precisely model the system state much lessaccount for uncertainty due to continuous variations. Such systems select a single queryplan based upon imprecise statistics. In this paper; we present “Query Mesh”(or QM); apractical alternative to state-of-the-art data stream processing approaches. The main idea ofQM is to compute multiple routes (ie; query plans); each designed for a particular subset ofthe data with distinct statistical properties. We use terms “plans” and “routes” …,Journal of computer and system sciences,2013,22
Scalable stream join processing with expensive predicates: workload distribution and adaptation by time-slicing,Song Wang; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract Multi-way stream joins with expensive join predicates lead to great challenge forreal-time (or close to real-time) stream processing. Given the memory-and CPU-intensivenature of such stream join queries; scalable processing on a cluster must be employed. Thispaper proposes a novel scheme for distributed processing of generic multi-way joins withwindow constraints; called Pipelined State Partitioning (PSP). We target generic joins witharbitrarily join conditions; which are used in non-trivial stream applications such as imagematching and biometric recognizing. The PSP scheme partitions the states into disjointslices in the time domain; and then distributes the fine-grained states in the cluster; forming avirtual computation ring. Compared to replication-based distribution of non-equi-joins; PSPscheme is superior since:(1) zero state duplication and thus no repeated computations;(2) …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,22
A flexible object-oriented database model and implementation for capacity-augmenting views,YG Ra; HA Kuno; EA Rundensteiner,Abstract In this paper; we identify key features required from OODB systems in order toprovide support for advanced object-oriented tools that facilitate customized tool integrationand transparent changes to database schemata. These features include multiple classication; derived classes; view schemata; dynamic reclassication; and exible restructuring.Unfortunately; such features are currently not supported by commercial OODBMSs. In fact; inthis paper we demonstrate that the object model assumptions underlying most OODBsystems; namely; contiguous object layout; xed typing and upwards inheritance; con ict withthe identi ed requirements. We thus propose a exible object-oriented modeling approachbased on the object-slicing paradigm that overcomes these limitations.

First; we present an object-oriented data schemathat captures genomic data and their relationships required for this task; including the rawexperimental data and the derived data gotten through analysis. Our genome objectrepresentation efficiently supports the maintenance of unordered; partially ordered; andcompletely ordered sets of data based on an overlap refinement hierarchy of intervalrelationships.

Self-tuning query mesh for adaptive multi-route query processing,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In real-life applications; different subsets of data may have distinct statisticalproperties; eg; various websites may have diverse visitation rates; different categories ofstocks may have dissimilar price fluctuation patterns. For such applications; it can be fruitfulto eliminate the commonly made single execution plan assumption and instead execute aquery using several plans; each optimally serving a subset of data with particular statisticalproperties. Furthermore; in dynamic environments; data properties may changecontinuously; thus calling for adaptivity. The intriguing question is: can we have an executionstrategy that (1) is plan-based to leverage on all the benefits of traditional plan-basedsystems;(2) supports multiple plans each customized for different subset of data; and yet (3)is as adaptive as" plan-less" systems like Eddies?

Optimization of nested xquery expressions with orderby clauses,Song Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract XQuery; the defacto XML query language; is a functional language with operationalsemantics; which precludes the direct application of classical query optimization techniques.The features of XQuery; such as nested expressions and ordered semantics; furtheraggravate this situation. The appropriate extension of existing optimization techniques toXQuery processing hence represents an important and non-trivial task. We propose analgebraic rewriting technique of nested XQuery expressions containing explicit orderbyclauses. Unlike prior work; this technique enables the optimization of nested XQueryexpressions not only with set but also with ordered sequence semantics. Our technique isbased on two steps. First; we perform order-sensitive algebraic query unnesting. Second; weapply query minimization techniques that exploit pairwise XPath set containment after …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,21
Merging R-trees: Efficient strategies for local bulk insertion,Li Chen; Rupesh Choubey; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract A lot of recent work has focussed on bulk loading of data into multidimensionalindex structures in order to efficiently construct such structures for large datasets. In thispaper; we address this problem with particular focus on R-trees—which are an importantclass of index structures used widely in commercial database systems. We propose a newtechnique; which as opposed to the current technique of inserting data one by one; bulkinserts entire new datasets into an active R-tree. This technique; called STLT (for small-tree-large-tree); considers the new dataset as an R-tree itself (small tree); identifies and preparesa suitable location in the original R-tree (large tree) for insertion; and lastly performs theinsert of the small tree into the large tree.

An adaptive multi-objective scheduling selection framework for continuous query processing,Timothy M Sutherland; Bradford Pielech; Yali Zhu; Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Adaptive operator scheduling algorithms for continuous query processing are usuallydesigned to serve a single performance objective; such as minimizing memory usage ormaximizing query throughput. We observe that different performance objectives maysometimes conflict with each other. Also due to the dynamic nature of streamingenvironments; the performance objective may need to change dynamically. Furthermore; theperformance specification defined by users may itself be multi-dimensional. Therefore;utilizing a single scheduling algorithm optimized for a single objective is no longer sufficient.In this paper; we propose a novel adaptive scheduling algorithm selection framework namedAMoS. It is able to leverage the strengths of existing scheduling algorithms to meet multipleperformance objectives.

Batch data warehouse maintenance in dynamic environments,Bin Liu; Songting Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehouse view maintenance is an important issue due to the growing use ofwarehouse technology for information integration and data analysis. Given the dynamicnature of modern distributed environments; both data updates and schema changes arelikely to occur in different data sources. In applications that the real-time refreshment of datawarehouse extent under source changes is not critical; the source updates are usuallymaintained in a batch fashion to reduce the maintenance overhead. However; most priorwork can only deal with batch source data updates. In this paper; we provide a solutionstrategy that is capable of batching both source data updates and schema changes. Wepropose techniques to first preprocess the initial source updates to summarize deltachanges for each source.

A transactional approach to parallel data warehouse maintenance,Bin Liu; Songting Chen; Elk A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data Warehousing is becoming an increasingly important technology forinformation integration and data analysis. Given the dynamic nature of modern distributedenvironments; both source data and schema changes are likely to occur autonomously andeven concurrently in different sources. We have thus developed a comprehensive solutionapproach; called TxnWrap; that successfully maintains the warehouse views under any typeof concurrent source updates. In this work; we now overcome TxnWrap's restriction that themaintenance is processed one by one for each source update; since that limits theperformance. To overcome this limitation; we exploit the transactional approach of TxnWrapto achieve parallel data warehouse maintenance. For this; we first identify the read/writeconflicts among the different warehouse maintenance processes. We then propose a …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2002,20
Incremental maintenance of schema-restructuring views,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract An important issue in data integration is the integration of semantically equivalentbut schematically heterogeneous data sources. Declarative mechanisms supportingpowerful source restructuring for such databases have been proposed in the literature; suchas the SQL extension SchemaSQL. However; the issue of incremental maintenance of viewsdefined in such languages remains an open problem. We present an incremental viewmaintenance algorithm for schema-restructuring views. Our algorithm transforms a sourceupdate into an incremental view update; by propagating updates through the operators of aSchemaSQL algebra tree. We observe that schema-restructuring view maintenance requirestransformation of data into schema changes and vice versa.

Optimizing performance of schema evolution sequences,Kajal T Claypool; Chandrakant Natarajan; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract More than ever before schema transformation is a prevalent problem that needs tobe addressed to accomplish for example the mi-gration of legacy systems to the newerOODB systems; the generation of structured web pages from data in database systems; orthe integration of systems with different native data models. Such schema transformationsare typically composed of a sequence of schema evolution operations. The execution ofsuch sequences can be very time-intensive; possibly requi-ring many hours or even daysand thus effectively making the database unavailable for unacceptable time spans. Whileresearchers have looked at the deferred execution approach for schema evolution in aneffort to improve availability of the system; to the best of our knowledge ours is the first effortto provide a direct optimization strategy for a sequence of changes.

Component synthesis from functional descriptions,Elke A Rundensteiner; Daniel D Gajski; Lubomir Bic,The authors point out that in functional modeling; the functionalities of one or morecomponents; like arithmetic/logic units; memories; and counters; are described as separateconcurrent blocks. An algorithm; called the functional synthesis algorithm (FSA); forsynthesis from these functional descriptions is presented. The algorithm automaticallysynthesizes components needed to implement a functional description while minimizinghardware costs and performance. Since a functional description uses standard operators inthe hardware description language; a mismatch between the operators of the language andthe functionalities provided by library components arises. FSA solves this functionalitymismatch problem by pattern matching between the description and a library of functionpatterns. In addition; FSA clusters functions to maximally match components from a given …,IEEE transactions on computer-aided design of integrated circuits and systems,1993,20

Utility-driven load shedding for xml stream processing,Mingzhu Wei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract Because of the high volume and unpredictable arrival rate; stream processingsystems may not always be able to keep up with the input data streams-resulting in bufferoverflow and uncontrolled loss of data. Load shedding; the prevalent strategy for solving thisoverflow problem; has so far only been considered for relational stream processing; but notfor XML. Shedding applied to XML stream processing brings new opportunities andchallenges due to complex nested nature of XML structures. In this paper; we tackle thisunsolved XML shedding problem using a three-pronged approach. First; we develop anXQuery preference model that enables users to specify the relative importance of preservingdifferent subpatterns in the XML result structure.

On the updatability of XML views published over relational data,Ling Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Updates over virtual XML views that wrap the relational data have not been wellsupported by current XML data management systems. This paper studies the problem of theexistence of a correct relational update translation for a given view update. First; we proposea clean extended-source theory to decide whether a translation mapping is correct. Then toanswer the question of the existence of a correct mapping; we classify a view update aseither un-translatable; conditionally or unconditionally translatable under a given updatetranslation policy. We design a graph-based algorithm to classify a given update into one ofthe three update categories based on schema knowledge extracted from the XML view andthe relational base. This now represents a practical approach that could be applied by anyexisting view update system in industry and in academic for analyzing the translatability of …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2004,19

TOSE uses thecombination of views and versioning to simulate schema changes requested by oneapplication without affecting other applications interoperating on a shared OODB. Theapproach is of high practical relevance as it builds upon schema evolution support offeredby commercial OODBMSs.,*,1998,19
Schema evolution of an object-oriented real-time database system for manufacturing automation,Lei Zhou; Elke A Rundensteiner; Kang G Shin,Database schemata often experience considerable changes during the development andinitial use phases of database systems for advanced applications such as manufacturingautomation and computer-aided design. An automated schema evolution system cansignificantly reduce the amount of effort and potential errors related to schema changes.Although schema evolution for nonreal-time databases was the subject of previousresearch; its impact on real-time database systems remains unexplored. These advancedapplications typically utilize object-oriented data models to handle complex data types.However; there exists no agreed-upon real-time object-oriented data model that can beused as a foundation to define a schema-evolution framework. Therefore; the authors firstdesign a conceptual real-time object-oriented data model; called Real-time Object Model …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,19
Set restrictions for semantic groupings,Elke A.  Rundensteiner; Lubomir Bic; Jonathan P.  Gilbert; Meng-Lai Yin,Most research on semantic integrity has taken place in the traditional database fields;specifically the relational data model. Advanced models; such as semantic and object-oriented data models; have developed higher level abstractions to increase their expressivepower in order to meet the needs of newly emerging application domains. This allows themto incorporate some semantic constraints directly into their schemas. There are; however;many types of restrictions that cannot be expressed solely by these high-level constructs.Therefore we extend the potential of advanced models by augmenting their abstractions withuseful set restrictions. In particular; we identify and formulate four of their most commonsemantic groupings: set groupings; is-a related set groupings; power set groupings; andCartesian product groupings. For each; we define a number of restrictions that control its …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1994,19
Tools for view generation in object-oriented databases,Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract This paper discusses two aspects of the objectoriented view management system;Multi View; which we designed to simplify view specification. First; we iniroduce a querylanguage for view customization that operates on a complete schema; rather than derivingonly individual virtual classes. This graph algebra promises to reduce the effort involved inview specification by low-ering the number of queries necessary to dejine a view. Second;we introduce a tool that guarantees the composition of view classes into arbitrarily complex;yet consistent; view schemata. Unlike for relational views; generalization relationships in 00views must be validated so that they are consistent with the global schema. In our system;we solve this problem by reformulating view schema construction as a classical graph theoryproblem; called minimal covering. This allows us to develop eficient algorithms that …,Proceedings of the second international conference on Information and knowledge management,1993,19
Sangam-a solution to support multiple data models; their mappings and maintenance,Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner; Xin Zhang; Su Hong; Harumi Kuno; Wang-chien Lee; Gail Mitchell,1. OVERVIEW Networked environments like the Internet have catalyzed a phenomenalgrowth in the publication of data bringing with it an increasing need to share and integrateinformation. Alas; the format of data to be integrated varies from company to company andsometimes from person to person. To accomplish tasks such as data sharing; exchange; andintegration; we may need to map an XML schema to a relational schema to drivetransformation of XML elements into relational data or map an XML schema of oneapplication to that of another; or a query posed against a high-level semantic model mayneed to be mapped into an equivalent query posed against a logical database schema. Inthis project; we present a novel model management system; & [1] that provides a completeand integrated solution to the large problem; as well as an infra-structure for creating …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,18
Txnwrap: A transactional approach to data warehouse maintenance,Jun Chen; Songting Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract A Data Warehouse Management System (DWMS) maintains materialized viewsderived from one or more information sources (ISs) under source changes. Much recentresearch has developed maintenance algorithms to achieve data warehouse consistencyunder source data updates typically by sending additional compensation-based messagesto information source space. Given the highly dynamic nature of modern distributedenvironments such as the WWW; both source data or schema changes are likely to occurautonomously and even concurrently. Most previous solutions become invalid under thisnew requirement; causing both wrong query results returned from IS space or evencomplete rejection messages. This paper now proposes to tackle this problem from adifferent angle by rephasing it as a global distributed transaction problem; and develops a …,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,2001,18
Scalable visual hierarchy exploration,Ionel D Stroe; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Modern computer applications; from business decision support to scientific dataanalysis; utilize visualization techniques to support exploratory activities. However; mostexisting visual exploration tools do not scale well for large data sets; ie; the level of clutteringon the screen is typically unacceptable and the performance is poor. To solve the clutteredinterface problem; visualization tools have recently been extended to support hierarchicalviews of the data; with support for focusing and drilling-down using interactive brushes. Tosolve the scalability problem; we now investigate how best to couple such a near real-timeresponsive visualization tool with a database management system. This integration must bedone carefully; since the direct implementation of the visual user interactions on hierarchicaldatasets corresponds to recursive query processing and thus is highly inefficient.

Flexible database transformations: The SERF approach,Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Database transformation is a critical task that occurs in many different domains.Schema evolution is one important class of problems for database transformations. In ourwork; we use existing technology and standards (ODMG; OQL; basic schema evolutionprimitives) to bring flexibility; extensibility and re-usability to current schema evolutionsystems; thus allowing the users to conveniently specify any customized transformation oftheir choice. We also investigate the re-usabilty of our framework to other applicationsbeyond schema evolution such as web re-structuring.,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,1999,18
Using containment information for view evolution in dynamic distributed environments,Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,The maintenance of materialized views in large scale environments composed of numerousinformation sources (ISs); such as in the WWW; is complicated by ISs not only continuouslymodifying their contents bur also their capabilities (schemas and query interfaces). Withcurrent view technology; views become undefined when ISs change their capabilities. OurEvolvable View Environment (EVE) project addresses this new problem of evolving viewsunder IS capabilities changes; which we call the view synchronization problem. Keyprinciples of EVE include a user specified preference model for view evolution (Evolvable-SQL (E-SQL)) and a Model for Information Source Descriptions (MISD). We present a formalcharacterization of correctness of view synchronization using containment constraintsdefined in MISD. Then; we give a novel view synchronization algorithm for view rewriting …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1998. Proceedings. Ninth International Workshop on,1998,18
Functional synthesis using area and delay optimization,Elke A Rundensteiner; Daniel D Gajski,Abstract It is generally overlooked that designers use functional models more frequently thanbehavioral or gate-level models. In functional modeling; the functionality of one or i moreregister-transfer level RTL) components are described as separate concurrent bloc s using ahardware description language such as VHDL. In this paper; we present two algorithms thatsynthesize a nethkt of RTL components from a functional description while minimizinghardware costs and delay; Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms producedesigns that are comparable to those produced by human designers.,Proceedings of the 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference,1992,18
Detecting moving object outliers in massive-scale trajectory streams,Yanwei Yu; Lei Cao; Elke A Rundensteiner; Qin Wang,Abstract The detection of abnormal moving objects over high-volume trajectory streams iscritical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportationmanagement. Yet this problem remains largely unexplored. In this work; we first proposeclasses of novel trajectory outlier definitions that model the anomalous behavior of movingobjects for a large range of real time applications. Our theoretical analysis and empiricalstudy on the Beijing Taxi and GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indicator) datasets demonstrateits effectiveness in capturing abnormal moving objects. Furthermore we propose a generalstrategy for efficiently detecting the new outlier classes. It features three fundamentaloptimization principles designed to minimize the detection costs. Our comprehensiveexperimental studies demonstrate that our proposed strategy drives the detection costs …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,17
Interactive outlier exploration in big data streams,Lei Cao; Qingyang Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract We demonstrate our VSOutlier system for supporting interactive exploration ofoutliers in big data streams. VSOutlier not only supports a rich variety of outlier typessupported by innovative and efficient outlier detection strategies; but also provides a rich setof interactive interfaces to explore outliers in real time. Using the stock transactions datasetfrom the US stock market and the moving objects dataset from MITRE; we demonstrate thatthe VSOutlier system enables analysts to more efficiently identify; understand; and respondto phenomena of interest in near real-time even when applied to high volume streams.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17
Robust distributed stream processing,Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Joshua D Guttman,Distributed stream processing systems must function efficiently for data streams that fluctuatein their arrival rates and data distributions. Yet repeated and prohibitively expensive load re-allocation across machines may make these systems ineffective; potentially resulting in dataloss or even system failure. To overcome this problem; we instead propose a loaddistribution (RLD) strategy that is robust to data fluctuations. RLD provides ϵ-optimal queryperformance under load fluctuations without suffering from the performance penalty causedby load migration. RLD is based on three key strategies. First; we model robust distributedstream processing as a parametric query optimization problem. The notions of robust logicaland robust physical plans then are overlays of this parameter space. Second; our Early-terminated Robust Partitioning (ERP) finds a set of robust logical plans; covering the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,17
Summarization and matching of density-based clusters in streaming environments,Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Density-based cluster mining is known to serve a broad range of applicationsranging from stock trade analysis to moving object monitoring. Although methods for efficientextraction of density-based clusters have been studied in the literature; the problem ofsummarizing and matching of such clusters with arbitrary shapes and complex clusterstructures remains unsolved. Therefore; the goal of our work is to extend the state-of-art ofdensity-based cluster mining in streams from cluster extraction only to now also supportanalysis and management of the extracted clusters. Our work solves three major technicalchallenges. First; we propose a novel multi-resolution cluster summarization method; calledSkeletal Grid Summarization (SGS); which captures the key features of density-basedclusters; covering both their external shape and internal cluster structures. Second; in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,17
Tagging stream data for rich real-time services,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In recent years; data streams have become ubiquitous as technology is improvingand the prices of portable devices are falling; eg; sensor networks; location-based services.Most data streams transmit only data tuples based on which continuous queries areevaluated. In this paper; we propose to enrich data streams with a new type of metadatacalled streaming tags or short tick-tags. The fundamental premise of tagging is that userscan label data using uncontrolled vocabulary; and these tags can be exploited in a widevariety of applications; such as data exploration; data search; and to produce" enriched" withadditional semantics; thus more informative query results. In this paper we focus primarily onthe problem of continuous query processing with streaming tags and tagged objects; andaddress the tick-tag semantic issues as well as efficiency concerns.

Processing recursive XQuery over XML streams: The Raindrop approach,Mingzhu Wei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani; Ming Li,Abstract XML stream applications bring the challenge of efficiently processing queries onsequentially accessible token-based data. For efficient processing of queries; we need toensure that memory usage stays low. This in turn requires that we avoid holding data in thequery buffer; by outputting it at the earliest possible time. In this paper; we propose a newclass of stream algebra operators for efficient recursive XQuery stream processing. Our plangenerator will analyze the query; and the schema when available to determine which joinoperators in the query need recursive join support and thus can plug in the moreinexpensive just-in-time structural join whenever possible. In particular; we propose twostrategies for implementing structural joins:(a) the just-in-time structural join strategyefficiently processes joins over non-recursive XML token streams; and (b) the recursive …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,17
Automaton meets algebra: a hybrid paradigm for XML stream processing,Hong Su; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract XML stream applications bring the challenge of efficiently processing queries onsequentially accessible token-based data streams. The automata paradigm is naturallysuited for pattern recognition on tokenized XML streams; but requires patches for fulfillingthe filtering or restructuring functionalities in the XML query language. In contrast; thealgebraic paradigm is a well-established technique for processing self-contained tuples. Ithowever does not traditionally support token inputs. The Raindrop framework is the first toaccommodate these two paradigms within one algebraic framework; taking advantage ofboth. This paper describes the overall framework; highlighting in particular three aspects.First; we describe how the tokens and tuples are modeled in one uniform query processingmodel. Second; we present the query rewriting that switches computations between these …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,17
Xquery containment in presence of variable binding dependencies,Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Semantic caching is an important technology for improving the response time offuture user queries specified over remote servers. This paper deals with the fundamentalquery containment problem in an XQuery-based semantic caching system. To our bestknowledge; the impact of subtle differences in XQuery semantics caused by different ways ofspecifying variables on query containment has not yet been studied. We introduce theconcept of variable binding dependencies for representing the hierarchical elementdependencies preserved by an XQuery. We analyze the problem of XQuery containment inthe presence of such dependencies. We propose a containment mapping technique fornested XQuery in presence of variable binding dependencies. The implication of the nestedblock structure on XQuery containment is also considered. We mention the performance …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,17

Ifthe data and analysis are available over the Web this promotes E-Business by connectingclientele worldwide. This paper describes such a predictive tool" QuenchMiner™" in thedomain" Materials Science". Data mining; more specifically the" Apriori Algorithm"; is used toderive association rules that represent relationships between input conditions and results ofdomain experiments. This enables the tool to answer questions such as" Given coolingmedium and agitation during material heat treatment; predict cooling rate". This allows usersto perform case studies on the Web and use their results to optimize the involved processes;thus increasing customer satisfaction.

A fine-grained replacement strategy for XML query cache,Li Chen; Song Wang; Elizabeth Cash; Burke Ryder; Ian Hobbs; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Caching popular queries and reusing results of previously computed queries is oneimportant query optimization technique; especially in modern distributed environments suchas the WWW. Based on the recent proliferation of XML data and the emergence of theXQuery language; we are thus developing a query-based caching system for XQueryqueries; called ACE-XQ. ACE-XQ applies innovative query containment and rewritingstrategies to answer incoming user queries based on the cached XQueries; wheneverpossible; instead of accessing remote XML data sources. To manage the space of thecache; a straightforward application of traditional replacement strategies would correspondto removing a complete cached query and its derived XML document as a whole whenspace needs to be freed. This coarse granularity however does not match well with the …,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Web information and data management,2002,17
XCache: XQuery-based Caching System.,Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract. Caching popular queries and reusing results of these previously computed queriesto speed up query processing is one important query optimization technique for distributedenvironments such as the Web. However; existing query-based cache systems; based onquery containment and rewriting techniques developed for relational queries; are notappropriate for supporting the more powerful· ML queries. We hence propose the firstsolution for· ML query processing using cached· Query views. In particular; we describe inthis paper an· Query-based semantic caching system called ÂCE-· Q; that we haveimplemented to realize the proposed containment mapping and query rewriting techniques.Preliminary experiments confirm the feasibility of our approach and also illustrate theperformance gains achievable by ÂCE-· Q over the original· Query query engine.,WebDB,2002,17
The MRE wrapper approach: enabling incremental view maintenance of data warehouses defined on multi-relation information sources,Lingli Ding; Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Some of the most recently proposed algorithms for the incremental maintenance ofmaterialized data warehouses (DW); such as SWEEP and PSWEEP; offer several significantadvantages over previous solutions; such as high-performance; no potential for infinite waitsand reduced remote queries and thus reduced network and information source (IS) loads.However; similar to many other algorithms; they still have the restricting assumption thateach IS can be composed of just one single relation. This is unrealistic in practice. In thispaper; we hence propose a solution to overcome this restriction. The Multi-RelationEncapsulation (MRE) Wrapper supports multiple relations in ISs in a manner transparent tothe rest of the environment. The MRE Wrapper treats one IS composed of multiple relationsas if it were a single relation from the DW point of view; thus any existing incremental view …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,1999,17
Psweep: Parallel view maintenance under concurrent data updates of distributed sources,Xin Zhang; L Ding; EA Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehouses (DW) are built by gathering information from several informationsources (ISs) and integrating it into one repository customized to users' needs. Recent workhas begun to address the problem of view maintenance of DWs under concurrent dataupdates of di erent ISs. SWEEP proposed by Agrawal et al. AAS97] is one of the morepopular solutions; even though its performance is limited due to enforcing a sequentialordering on the handling of data updates from ISs by the view maintenance module. Wehave overcome this limitation by developing a parallel algorithm for view maintenance;called PSWEEP; that still incorporates all bene ts of SWEEP while o ering substantiallyimproved performance. In order to perform parallel view maintenance; we solve two issues:detecting maintenance-concurrent data updates in a parallel mode; and correcting the …,Technical Report WPI-CS-TR-99-14,1999,17
Designing Databases with Fuzzy Data and Rules for Application to Discrete Control,Nauman Chaudhry; James Moyne; Elke A Rundensteiner,Many real world systems and applications must deal with imprecise or vague data. For suchsystems; information management components are needed that provide support formanaging this imprecise data. Fuzzy theory allows us to model imprecise or vague data. Theuse of fuzzy theory also allows us to model vague knowledge. There have been severalproposals for extending relational database systems in order to represent as well as queryfuzzy data. However; little work has been done in modeling uncertainty at the conceptualschema level or in developing higher level conceptual models for fuzzy rules. To fill the firstgap; the authors have proposed a design methodology for fuzzy relational databases. Thismethodology prescribes a sequence of steps to implement a fuzzy relational database froma proposed extended fuzzy Entity-Relationship model. In this paper; we also propose a …,*,1994,17
A shared execution strategy for multiple pattern mining requests over streaming data,Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract In diverse applications ranging from stock trading to traffic monitoring; popular datastreams are typically monitored by multiple analysts for patterns of interest. These analystsmay submit similar pattern mining requests; such as cluster detection queries; yetcustomized with different parameter settings. In this work; we present an efficient sharedexecution strategy for processing a large number of density-based cluster detection querieswith arbitrary parameter settings. Given the high algorithmic complexity of the clusteringprocess and the real-time responsiveness required by streaming applications; servingmultiple such queries in a single system is extremely resource intensive. The naive methodof detecting and maintaining clusters for different queries independently is often in-feasiblein practice; as its demands on system resources increase dramatically with the cardinality …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,16
ClusterSheddy: Load shedding using moving clusters over spatio-temporal data streams,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Moving object environments are characterized by large numbers of objectscontinuously sending location updates. At times; data arrival rates may spike up; causing theload on the system to exceed its capacity. This may result in increased output latencies;potentially leading to invalid or obsolete answers. Dropping data randomly; the mostfrequently used approach in the literature for load shedding; may adversely affect theaccuracy of the results. We thus propose a load shedding technique customized for spatio-temporal stream data. In our model; spatio-temporal properties; such as location; time;direction and speed over time; serve as critical factors in the load shedding decision. Themain idea is to abstract similarly moving objects into moving clusters which serve assummaries of their members' movement. Based on resource restrictions; members within …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,16
Replacement strategies for XQuery caching systems,Li Chen; Song Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract To improve the query performance over XML documents in a distributedenvironment; we develop a semantic caching system named ACE-XQ for XQuery queries.ACE-XQ applies innovative query containment and rewriting techniques to answer userqueries using cached queries. We also design a fine-grained replacement strategy whichrecords user access statistics at a finer granularity than the complete XML query regions. Asa result; less frequently used XML view fragments are replaced to maintain a betterutilization of the cache space. Extensive experimental results illustrate the performanceimprovement achieved by this strategy over the traditional one for a variety of situations.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2004,16
Sangam: A Framework for Modeling Heterogeneous Database Transformations.,Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract: A broad spectrum of data is available on-line in distinct heterogeneous sources;and stored under different formats. As the number of systems that utilize the heterogeneousdata sources grows; the importance of data translation and conversion mechanismsincreases greatly. The goal of our work is a to design a framework that simplifies the task oftranslation specification and execution. Translation specification between the source and thetarget schema can be accomplished via (1) the discovery of matches between the sourceand the target schemata;(2) the application of a pre-defined translation templates; or (3) viamanual user specification. In this paper we present a flexible; extensible and re-usabletranslation modeling framework wherein users can (1) explicitly model the translationsbetween schemas;(2) compose translations from an existing library of modeled …,ICEIS (1),2003,16
Non-equivalent query rewritings,Amy J Lee; Andreas Koeller; Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,Previous work in query rewriting has made the restricting assumption that the rewritten querymust be equivalent to the initially given query. We now propose to relax this assumption toallow for query rewriting in situations where equivalent rewritings may not exist {yet alternatenot necessarily equivalent query rewritings may still be preferable to users over notreceiving any answers at all. In this paper; we apply this concept of non-equivalent queryrewriting to the problem of maintaining view de nitions (data warehouses); where it nowallows us to handle a much larger class of changes of the underlying information sources;namely not only data but also schema changes. This relaxed query notion allows for morediversity in acceptable query answers; but also raises a new issue of the evaluation of suchqueries. For this purpose; we introduce an analytical model of query rewritings that …,International Database Conference; Hong Kong,1999,16
Comparing MMVIS to a timeline for temporal trend analysis of video data,Stacie Hibino; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Our MultiMedia Visual Information Seeking (MMVIS) environment provides anexploratory visual paradigm for temporal trend analysis. In this paper; we present the resultsof a user interface study evaluating the utility of MMVIS. We compare MMVIS to a timeline-based approach for analyzing temporal trends in real video data. We evaluate the quantity;complexity and accuracy of temporal trend observations made within each interface;compare the number of positive versus negative trends found; and collect feedback on usersatisfaction. Our results show that subjects made interesting and complex observations oftemporal trends using either interface. The results also indicate some advantages andbiases of each interface; such as 1) timeline subjects make more errors during analysis and2) timeline subjects are biased against identifying negative trends such as exceptions.

Processing nested complex sequence pattern queries over event streams,Mo Liu; Medhabi Ray; Elke A Rundensteiner; Daniel J Dougherty; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Ismail Ari; Abhay Mehta,Abstract Complex event processing (CEP) has become increasingly important for trackingand monitoring applications ranging from health care; supply chain management tosurveillance. These monitoring applications submit complex event queries to tracksequences of events that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need forincreasingly complex nested sequence queries arises; while the state-of-the-art CEPsystems mostly focus on the execution of flat sequence queries only. In this paper; we nowintroduce an iterative execution strategy for nested CEP queries composed of sequence;negation; AND and OR operators.

Enhancing scatterplot matrices for data with ordering or spatial attributes,Qingguang Cui; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,The scatterplot matrix is one of the most common methods used to project multivariate dataonto two dimensions for display. While each off-diagonal plot maps a pair of non-identicaldimensions; there is no prescribed mapping for the diagonal plots. In this paper; histograms;1D plots and 2D plots are drawn in the diagonal plots of the scatterplots matrix. In 1D plots;the data are assumed to have order; and they are projected in this order. In 2D plots; thedata are assumed to have spatial information; and they are projected onto locations basedon these spatial attributes using color to represent the dimension value.

Heuristic strategies for inclusion dependency discovery,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Inclusion dependencies (INDs) between databases are assertions of subset-relationships between sets of attributes (dimensions) in two relations. Such dependenciesare useful for a number of purposes related to information integration; such as databasesimilarity discovery and foreign key discovery. An exhaustive approach at discovering INDsbetween two relations suffers from the dimensionality curse; since the number of potentialmappings of size k between the attributes of two relations is exponential in k. Levelwise(Apriori-like) approaches at discovery do not scale for this reason beyond ak of 8 to 10.Approaches modeling the similarity space as a hypergraph (with the hyperedges of thegraph representing sets of related attributes) are promising; but also do not scale very well.This paper discusses approaches to scale discovery algorithms for INDs.

Incremental maintenance of schema-restructuring views in SchemaSQL,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,The integration of data; especially from heterogeneous sources; is a hard and widely studiedproblem. One particularly challenging issue is the integration of sources that aresemantically equivalent but schematically heterogeneous. While two such data sources mayrepresent the same information; one may store the information inside tuples (data) while theother may store it in attribute or relation names (schema). The SchemaSQL query languageis a recent solution to this problem powerful enough to restructure such sources into eachother without the loss of information. We propose the first incremental view maintenancestrategy for such schema-restructuring views. Our strategy; based on an algebraicrepresentation of the view query; correctly transforms a data update or a schema change toa source into sequences of schema and data updates to be applied to the view.

Optimizing path query performance: graph clustering strategies,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Path queries over transportation networks are operations required by manyGeographic Information Systems applications. Such networks; typically modeled as graphscomposed of nodes and links and represented as link relations; can be very large andhence often need to be stored on secondary storage devices. Path query computation oversuch large persistent networks amounts to high I/O costs due to having to repeatedly bring inlinks from the link relation from secondary storage into the main memory buffer forprocessing. This paper is the first to present a comparative experimental evaluation ofalternative graph clustering solutions in order to show their effectiveness in path queryprocessing over transportation networks. Clustering optimization is attractive because itdoes not incur any run-time cost; requires no auxiliary data structures; and is …,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2000,15
The SDCC framework for integrating existing algorithms for diverse data warehouse maintenance tasks,Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Recently proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of concurrent dataupdates happening at different autonomous information systems (ISs); whereas the EVE(Evolvable View Environment) system addresses the maintenance of a data warehouse(DW) after IS schema changes. The concurrency of schema changes and data updates stillremains an unexplored problem; however. This paper provides a solution that guaranteesconcurrent view definition evolution and view extent maintenance of a DW defined overdistributed ISs. For this problem; we introduce a framework called SDCC (Schema changeand Data update Concurrency Control) system.

Data warehouse maintenance under concurrent schema and data updates,Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Summary form only given. Data warehouses (DW) are built by gathering information fromseveral information sources (IS) and integrating it into one repository customized to users'needs. ISs are typically owned by different information providers and hence are independentand autonomous. This implies they will update their data and schemas independently andwithout any concern for how this may affect the DW defined upon them. Hence; solutions fordata warehouse maintenance are needed that can handle such IS updates. We havedeveloped a first comprehensive solution that successfully tackles this problem (X. Zhang etal.; 1998). In particular; to guarantee the correctness of concurrent view definition evolutionand view extent maintenance of a data warehouse; we introduce a framework called theSDCC (Schema change and Data update Concurrency Control) system.

Rate-monotonic scheduling in the presence of timing unpredictability,Lei Zhou; Kang G Shin; Elke A Rundensteiner,Scheduling periodic hard real time tasks is of great importance to many real timeapplications; such as open architecture machine tool controllers and avionic systems. Therate monotonic scheduling algorithm has been proven to provide an optimal static priorityassignment under idealized conditions. However some of these conditions are not met in areal computer system. In particular the release times of tasks can deviate from the specifiedtime instants because of operating system software timer unpredictability. We investigate thetimer behaviors in three commercial real time operating systems; VxWorks; QNX andpSOSystem. Based on our findings; we propose an empirical task schedulability model;called RMTU (Rate Monotonic in the presence of Timing Unpredictability); to augment therate monotonic scheduling theory in order to handle timing unpredictability.

Using hashtags as labels for supervised learning of emotions in twitter messages,Maryam Hasan; Emmanuel Agu; Elke Rundensteiner,ABSTRACT Many college students experience depression or anxiety but do not seek helpdue to the social stigma associated with psychological counseling services. Automatictechniques to classify social media messages based on the emotions they express canassist in the early detection of students in need of counseling. Supervised machine learningmethods yield accurate results but require training datasets of text messages that have beenlabelled with the classes of emotions they express. Manually labeling a large corpus ofTwitter messages is labor-intensive; error prone and time-consuming. Hashtags arekeywords inserted into social media messages by their authors. In this paper; we investigateusing hashtags as emotion labels and evaluate them through two user studies; one withpsychology experts and the other with the general crowd.

Mining neighbor-based patterns in data streams,Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Discovery of complex patterns such as clusters; outliers; and associations fromhuge volumes of streaming data has been recognized as critical for many applicationdomains. However; little research effort has been made toward detecting patterns withinsliding window semantics as required by real-time monitoring tasks; ranging from real timetraffic monitoring to stock trend analysis. Applying static pattern detection algorithms fromscratch to every window is impractical due to their high algorithmic complexity and the real-time responsiveness required by streaming applications. In this work; we develop methodsfor the incremental detection of neighbor-based patterns; in particular; density-basedclusters and distance-based outliers over sliding stream windows. Incremental computationfor pattern detection queries is challenging. This is because purging of to-be-expired data …,Information Systems,2013,14
Pointwise local pattern exploration for sensitivity analysis,Zhenyu Guo; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz,Sensitivity analysis is a powerful method for discovering the significant factors that contributeto targets and understanding the interaction between variables in multivariate datasets. Anumber of sensitivity analysis methods fall into the class of local analysis; in which thesensitivity is defined as the partial derivatives of a target variable with respect to a group ofindependent variables. Incorporating sensitivity analysis in visual analytic tools is essentialfor multivariate phenomena analysis. However; most current multivariate visualizationtechniques do not allow users to explore local patterns individually for understanding thesensitivity from a pointwise view. In this paper; we present a novel pointwise local patternexploration system for visual sensitivity analysis. Using this system; analysts are able toexplore local patterns and the sensitivity at individual data points; which reveals the …,Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST); 2011 IEEE Conference on,2011,14
Skyline and mapping aware join query evaluation,Venkatesh Raghavan; Elke A Rundensteiner; Shweta Srivastava,Abstract Growing interests in multi-criteria decision support applications have resulted in aflurry of efficient skyline algorithms. In practice; real-world decision support applicationsrequire to access data from disparate sources. Existing techniques define the skylineoperation to work on a single set; and therefore; treat skylines as an “add-on” on top of atraditional Select-Project-Join query plan. In many real-world applications; the skylinedimensions can be anti-correlated such as the attribute pair {price; mileage} for cars and{price; distance} for hotels. Anti-correlated data are particularly challenging for skylineevaluation and therefore have commonly been ignored by existing techniques. In this work;we propose a robust execution framework called SKIN to evaluate skyline over joins. Thesalient features of SKIN are:(a) effective in reducing the two primary costs; namely the …,Information Systems,2011,14
NEEL: The nested complex event language for real-time event analytics,Mo Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner; Dan Dougherty; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Ismail Ari; Abhay Mehta,Abstract Complex event processing (CEP) over event streams has become increasinglyimportant for real-time applications ranging from health care; supply chain management tobusiness intelligence. These monitoring applications submit complex event queries to tracksequences of events that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need forincreasingly complex nested sequence query support arises; while the state-of-art CEPsystems mostly support the execution of only flat sequence queries. In this paper; weintroduce our nested CEP query language NEEL for expressing nested queries composedof sequence; negation; AND and OR operators. Thereafter; we also define its formalsemantics. Subtle issues with negation and predicates within the nested sequence contextare discussed.

CAPE: A constraint-aware adaptive stream processing engine,Elke A Rundensteiner; Luping Ding; Yali Zhu; Timothy Sutherland; Braeford Pielech,The growth of electronic commerce and the widespread use of sensor networks has createdthe demand for online processing and monitoring applications [Madden and Franklin; 2002;Stream Repository; Tucker et al.; 2003]. In these applications; data is no longer staticallystored. Instead; it becomes available in the form of continuous streams. Furthermore; usersoften ask longrunning queries and expect the results to be delivered incrementally in realtime. Traditional query execution techniques; which assume finite persistent datasets andaim for producing a one-time query result; become largely inapplicable in this new streamparadigm due to the following reasons:• The data streams are potentially infinite.

Hierarchical exploration of large multivariate data sets,Jing Yang; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Multivariate data visualization techniques are often limited in terms of the number ofdata records that can be simultaneously displayed in a manner that allows readyinterpretation. Due to the size of the screen and number of pixels available; visualizing morethan a few thousand data points generally leads to clutter and occlusion. This in turn restrictsour ability to detect; classify; and measure phenomena of interest; such as clusters;anomalies; trends; and patterns. In this paper we describe our experiences in thedevelopment of multi-resolution visualization techniques for large multivariate data sets. Byhierarchically clustering the data and displaying aggregation information for each cluster; wecan examine the data set at multiple levels of abstraction. In addition; by providing powerfulnavigation and filtering operations; we can create an environment suitable for interactive …,*,2003,14
DyDa: Dynamic data warehouse maintenance in a fully concurrent environment,Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehouses (DW) are an emerging technology to support high-level decisionmaking by gathering information from several distributed information sources (ISs) into onematerialized repository. In dynamic environments such as the web; DWs must be maintainedin order to stay up-to-date. Recent maintenance algorithms tackle this problem of DWmanagement under concurrent data updates (DU); whereas the EVE system is the first tohandle (non-concurrent schema changes)(SC) of ISs. However; the concurrency of schemachanges by different ISs as well as the concurrency of interleaved SC and DU still remainunexplored problems. In this paper; we propose a solution framework called DyDa thatsuccessfully addresses both problems. The DyDa framework detects concurrent SCs by thebroken query scheme and conflicting concurrent DUs by a local timestamp scheme.

Evolvable view environment eve: A data warehouse system handling schema and data changes of distributed sources,EA Rundensteiner; A Koeller; X Zhang; AJ Lee; A Nica,Supporting independent ISs and integrating them in distributed data warehouses(materialized views) is becoming more important with the growth of the WWW. However;views de ned over autonomous ISs are susceptible to schema changes. In the EVE projectwe are developing techniques to support the maintenance of data warehouses de ned overdistributed dynamic ISs 6; 7; 8]. The EVE system is the rst to allow views to survive schemachanges of their underlying ISs while also adapting to changing data in those sources. EVEachieves this in two steps: applying view query rewriting algorithms that exploit informationabout alternative ISs and the information they contain; and incrementally adapting the viewextent to the view de nition changes.

Learning semantics-preserving distance metrics for clustering graphical data,Aparna S Varde; Elke A Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; Richard D Sisson Jr,Abstract In mining graphical data the default Euclidean distance is often used as a notion ofsimilarity. However this does not adequately capture semantics in our targeted domains;having graphical representations depicting results of scientific experiments. It is seldomknown a-priori what other distance metric best preserves semantics. This motivates the needto learn such a metric. A technique called LearnMet is proposed here to learn a domain-specific distance metric for graphical representations. Input to LearnMet is a training set ofcorrect clusters of such graphs. LearnMet iteratively compares these correct clusters withthose obtained from an arbitrary but fixed clustering algorithm. In the first iteration a guessedmetric is used for clustering. This metric is then refined using the error between the obtainedand correct clusters until the error is below a given threshold. LearnMet is evaluated …,Proceedings of the 6th international workshop on Multimedia data mining: mining integrated media and complex data,2005,13
Robust distributed query processing for streaming data,Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Distributed stream processing systems must function efficiently for data streams thatfluctuate in their arrival rates and data distributions. Yet repeated and prohibitivelyexpensive load reallocation across machines may make these systems ineffective;potentially resulting in data loss or even system failure. To overcome this problem; wepropose a comprehensive solution; called the Robust Load Distribution (RLD) strategy; thatis resilient under data fluctuations. RLD provides &epsi;-optimal query performance underan expected range of load fluctuations without suffering from the performance penaltycaused by load migration. RLD is based on three key strategies. First; we model robustdistributed stream processing as a parametric query optimization problem in a parameterspace that captures the stream fluctuations.

PARAS: a parameter space framework for online association mining,Xika Lin; Abhishek Mukherji; Elke A Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Association rule mining is known to be computationally intensive; yet real-timedecision-making applications are increasingly intolerant to delays. In this paper; weintroduce the parameter space model; called PARAS. PARAS enables efficient rule miningby compactly maintaining the final rulesets. The PARAS model is based on the notion ofstable region abstractions that form the coarse granularity ruleset space. Based on newinsights on the redundancy relationships among rules; PARAS establishes a surprisinglycompact representation of complex redundancy relationships while enabling efficientredundancy resolution at query-time. Besides the classical rule mining requests; the PARASmodel supports three novel classes of exploratory queries. Using the proposed PSpaceindex; these exploratory query classes can all be answered with near real-time …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,12
Semantic stream query optimization exploiting dynamic metadata,Luping Ding; Karen Works; Elke A Rundensteiner,Data stream management systems (DSMS) processing long-running queries over largevolumes of stream data must typically deliver time-critical responses. We propose the firstsemantic query optimization (SQO) approach that utilizes dynamic substream metadata atruntime to find a more efficient query plan than the one selected at compilation time. Weidentify four SQO techniques guaranteed to result in performance gains. Based on classicsatisfiability theory we then design a lightweight query optimization algorithm that efficientlydetects SQO opportunities at runtime. At the logical level; our algorithm instantiates multipleconcurrent SQO plans; each processing different partially overlapping substreams. Ournovel execution paradigm employs multi-modal operators to support the execution of theseconcurrent SQO logical plans in a single physical plan.

Optimizing cyclic join view maintenance over distributed data sources,Bin Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner,Materialized views defined over distributed data sources are critical for many applications toensure efficient access; reliable performance; and high availability. Materialized views needto be maintained upon source updates since stale view extents may not serve well or mayeven mislead user applications. Thus; view maintenance performance is one of the keys tothe success of these applications. In this work; we investigate two maintenance strategies;extended batching and view graph transformation; for maintaining general join views wherejoin conditions may exist between any pairs of data sources possibly with cycles. Manychoices are available for maintaining cyclic join views. We thus propose a cost-driven viewmaintenance framework which generates optimized maintenance plans tuned to theenvironmental settings. The proposed framework has been implemented in the TxnWrap …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2006,12
Heuristic strategies for the discovery of inclusion dependencies and other patterns,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Inclusion dependencies (INDs) between databases are assertions of subset-relationships between sets of attributes (dimensions) in two relations. Such dependenciesare useful for a number of purposes related to information integration; such as databasesimilarity discovery and foreign key discovery. An exhaustive approach at discovering INDsbetween two relations suffers from the dimensionality curse; since the number of potentialmappings between the attributes of two relations is exponential in the number of attributes.For this reason; levelwise (Apriori-like) approaches at discovery do not scale beyondrelations with 8 to 10 attributes. Approaches modeling the similarity space as graphs orhypergraphs are promising; but also do not scale very well.

SERF: ODMG-based generic re-structuring facility,Elke A Rundensteiner; K Claypool; Ming Li; Li Chen; Z Zhang; Chandrakant Natarajan; Jing Jin; Stacia De Lima; S Weiner,Abstract The age of information management and with it the advent of increasinglysophisticated technologies have kindled a need in the database community and others to re-structure existing systems and move forward to make use of these new technologies. Legacyapplication systems are being transformed to newer state-of-the-art systems; informationsources are being mapped from one data model to another; a diversity of data sources arebeing transformed to load; cleanse and consolidate data into modern data-warehouses[CR99]. Re-structuring is thus a critical task for a variety of applications. For this reason; mostobject-oriented database systems (OODB) today support some form of re-structuring support[Tec94; Obj93; BKKK87].

DIIM: a foundation for translating loosely-specified queries into executable plans in large-scale information systems,Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,Challenging issues for processing queries specified over large-scale information spaces (egdigital libraries or the World Wide Web) include the diversity of the information sources (ISs)in terms of their structures; query interfaces; as well as the dynamics of ISs continuouslybeing added; removed or upgraded. Typically user queries are loosely specified expressingwhat the user wants but not how and from where the information is to be retrieved. In thispaper we give an innovative solution for semantical query planning in such environments.The key idea underlying our solution is the notion of connected query rules defined to beprecisely specified; executable queries that are semantically equivalent to a user query. Forquery planning in such a large-scale space; we introduce DIIM-the Dynamic InformationIntegration Model which supports the description of not only content but also capabilities …,Cooperative Information Systems; 1997.

Multi View; which simplifies view schema design and maintenance by breakingview specification into the tasks of class derivation; global schema integration; view classselection; and view hierarchy generation; has been implemented on top of the GemStoneOODB.

Utility-maximizing event stream suppression,Di Wang; Yeye He; Elke Rundensteiner; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a technology for monitoringevent streams in search of user specified event patterns. When a CEP system is deployed insensitive environments the user may wish to mitigate leaks of private information whileensuring that useful nonsensitive patterns are still reported. In this paper we consider how tosuppress events in a stream to reduce the disclosure of sensitive patterns while maximizingthe detection of nonsensitive patterns. We first formally define the problem of utility-maximizing event suppression with privacy preferences; and analyze its computationalhardness. We then design a suite of real-time solutions to solve this problem. Our firstsolution optimally solves the problem at the event-type level.

Visual exploration of stream pattern changes using a data-driven framework,Zaixian Xie; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract When using visualization techniques to explore data streams; an important task is toconvey pattern changes. Challenges include:(1) Most data analysis tasks require users toobserve the pattern change over a long time range;(2) The change rate of patterns is not aconstant; and most users are normally more interested in bigger changes than smaller ones.Although distorting the time axis as proposed in the literature can partially solve thisproblem; most of these are driven by the user. This is however not applicable to streamingdata exploration tasks that normally require near real-time responsiveness. In this paper; wepropose a data-driven framework to merge and thus condense time windows having smallor no changes. Only significant changes are shown to users. Juxtaposed views arediscussed for conveying data pattern changes. Our experiments show that our merge …,International Symposium on Visual Computing,2010,11

The mainidea of QM is to compute multiple routes (ie; query plans); each designed for a particularsubset of data with distinct statistical properties. Based on the execution routes and the datacharacteristics; a classifier model is induced and is used to partition new data tuples toassign the best routes for their processing.

Automaton meets query algebra: Towards a unified model for XQuery evaluation over XML data streams,Jinhui Jian; Hong Su; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In this work; we address the efficient evaluation of XQuery expressions overcontinuous XML data streams; which is essential for a broad range of applications includingmonitoring systems and information dissemination systems. While previous work has shownthat automata theory is suited for on-the-fly pattern retrieval over XML data streams; we findthat automata-based approaches suffer from being not as flexibly optimizable as algebraicquery systems. In fact; they enforce a rigid data-driven paradigm of execution. We thus nowpropose a unified query model to augment automata-style processing with algebra-basedquery optimization techniques.

A strategy selection framework for adaptive prefetching in data visualization,Punit R Doshi; E Geraldine; GE Rosario; EA Rundensteiner; MA Ward,Accessing data stored in persistent memory represents a bottleneck for current visualexploration applications. Semantic caching of frequent queries at the client-side along withprefetching can improve performance of such systems. However; a prefetching setup thatonly uses one prefetching strategy may be insufficient because (1) different users havedifferent exploration patterns; and (2) a user's pattern may be changing within the samesession. To solve this; existing research focuses on refining a single prefetching strategy.We; on the other hand; now propose a framework wherein prefetching strategies areadaptively selected over time across and within one user session. This work is the first tostudy adaptive prefetching in the context of visual data exploration.

Schema evolution for real-time object-oriented databases,Lei Zhou; Elke A Rundensteiner; Kang G Shin,It has been shown that the database schemata often experience considerable changesduring the development and initial use phases of database systems for advancedapplications; such as automated manufacturing and computer-aided design. An automatedschema evolution system can significantly reduce the amount of work and potential errorsrelated to schema changes. Although schema evolution for non-real-time databases was thesubject of some previous research; its impact on real-time database systems remainsunexplored. Since these advanced applications typically utilize object-oriented models tohandle complex data types and there exists no agreed-upon real-time object model that canbe used as foundation to define a schema evolution framework; we first design a conceptualreal-time object-oriented data model; called ROMPP.

Achieving high output quality under limited resources through structure-based spilling in XML streams,Mingzhu Wei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract Because of high volumes and unpredictable arrival rates; stream processingsystems are not always able to keep up with input data-resulting in buffer overflow anduncontrolled loss of data. To produce eventually complete results; load spilling; whichpushes some fractions of data to disks temporarily; is commonly employed in relationalstream engines. In this work; we now introduce" structure-based spilling"; a spillingtechnique customized for XML streams by considering the partial spillage of possiblycomplex XML elements. Such structure-based spilling brings new challenges. When a pathis spilled; multiple paths may be affected. We analyze possible spilling effects on the querypaths and how to execute the" reduced" query to produce partial results.

U-filter: A lightweight XML view update checker,Ling Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Both XML-relational systems and native XML sys- tems support creating XML wrapper viewsand querying against them. However; update operations against such virtual XML views in mostcases are not supported yet. Two problems concerning updating XML views need to betackled. First; update translatability concerns whether the given update to the view can be achievedby updates on the base data without any view-side-effect [1; 6; 8]. This base data storage typicallymay be a relational database or a native XML document. Second; we need to devise an appropriatetranslation strategy; namely; as- suming the view update is indeed translatable; how to map theupdates on the XML view into the equivalent SQL up- dates or XML document updates on thebase data. The second issue; the translation strategy; has been studied in recent works [3; 4;10]. Under the assump- tion that the given update is translatable; [3; 4] propose an …,Data Engineering; 2006.

Incremental fusion of XML fragments through semantic identifiers,Maged El-Sayed; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Many applications; like materialized view maintenance and stream query processing;construct views incrementally over data sources. This results in computed pieces of objectsthat need to be merged by fusing corresponding objects together. This problem ischallenging when dealing with XML data for many reasons including the hierarchical andsemi-structured nature of XML data. Also XML query languages (eg; XQuery) are capable ofperforming complex operations and transformations such as arbitrary nesting and resultreconstruction. Moreover; since XML is an ordered data model; XML order has to be takeninto consideration when constructing XML results incrementally. In this paper we study theproblem of how to fuse XML pieces (fragments) generated by incrementally processing XMLdata into XML results.

Any change in the objectmodel such as the addition of an association or aggregation relationship affects many sub-systems including the schema evolution system. Under the current tightly-coupled databasearchitecture; updating the object model is an extremely expensive undertaking for adatabase vendor both in terms of time and resources. Adding a new construct to the objectmodel impacts the schema evolution system in two ways:(1) the new construct requires anew set of schema evolution primitives to enable its evolution; and (2) existing schemaevolution primitives must be modified to assure that they conform to the new constraints ofthe new object model. One traditional approach to address this is to manually change allaffected software; a time consuming task. We present an alternate two-prong solution. We …,*,2001,10
Symbolic intersect detection: A method for improving spatial intersect joins,Yun-Wu Huang; Matthew Jones; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Due to the increasing popularity of spatial databases; researchers have focusedtheir efforts on improving the query processing performance of the most expensive spatialdatabase operation: the spatial join. While most previous work focused on optimizing thefilter step; it has been discovered recently that; for typical GIS data sets; the refinement stepof spatial join processing actually requires a longer processing time than the filter step.Furthermore; two-thirds of the time in processing the refinement step is devoted to thecomputation of polygon intersections. To address this issue; we therefore introduce a novelapproach to spatial join optimization that drastically reduces the time of the refinement step.We propose a new approach called Symbolic Intersect Detection (SID) for early detection oftrue hits. Our SID optimization eliminates most of the expensive polygon intersect …,GeoInformatica,1998,10
Object-oriented view technology: Challenges and promises,Elke Angelika Rundensteiner,Abstract With object-oriented database (OODB) systems reaching the status of a maturingtechnology; increased attention has been given in recent years to the realization of viewmechanisms in OODBs. Objectoriented views have the potential for achieving importantservices; including system interoperability; security; heterogeneous systems integration;schema evolution; data warehousing; and work ow management; to just name a few. Giventhis rising interest; we report on the MultiView project which; now in its middle phase; is a ve-year NSF-funded e ort on exploring object-oriented view foundation and implementationissues as well as on applying view technology to a select subset of problems to evaluate itspotential.

Set operations in a data model supporting complex objects,Elke A Rundensteiner; Lubomir Bic,Abstract Class creation by set operations has largely been ignored in the literature. Precisesemantics of set operations on complex objects require a clear distinction between the dualnotions of a set and a type; both of which are present in a class. Our paper fills this gap bypresenting a framework for executing set-theoretic operations on the class construct. Theproposed set operations determine both the type description of the derived class as well asits set membership. For the former; we develop inheritance rules for property characteristicssuch as single-versus multi-valued and required versus optional. For the later; we borrowthe object identity concept from data modeling research. Our framework allows for propertyinheritance among classes that are not necessarily is a related.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1990,10
Scalable pattern sharing on event streams,Medhabi Ray; Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a technology of choice for highperformance event analytics in time-critical decision-making applications. Yet it is becomingincreasingly difficult to support high-performance event processing due to the rising numberand complexity of event pattern queries and the increasingly high velocity of event streams.In this work we design the SPASS framework that successfully tackles these demandingCEP workloads. Our SPASS optimizer identifies opportunities for effective sharedprocessing among CEP queries by leveraging time-based event correlations amongqueries. The problem of pattern sharing is shown to be NP-hard by reducing the MinimumSubstring Cover problem to our CEP pattern sharing problem. The SPASS optimizer isdesigned that finds a shared pattern plan in polynomial-time covering all sequence …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,9
Shared execution of recurring workloads in MapReduce,Chuan Lei; Zhongfang Zhuang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Mohamed Eltabakh,Abstract With the increasing complexity of data-intensive MapReduce workloads; Hadoopmust often accommodate hundreds or even thousands of recurring analytics queries thatperiodically execute over frequently updated datasets; eg; latest stock transactions; new logfiles; or recent news feeds. For many applications; such recurring queries come with user-specified service-level agreements (SLAs); commonly expressed as the maximum allowedlatency for producing results before their merits decay. The recurring nature of theseemerging workloads combined with their SLA constraints make it challenging to share andoptimize their execution. While some recent efforts on multi-job optimization in MapReducehave emerged; they focus on only sharing work among ad-hoc jobs on static datasets.Unfortunately; these sharing techniques neither take the recurring nature of the queries …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,9
Complex event analytics: Online aggregation of stream sequence patterns,Yingmei Qi; Lei Cao; Medhabi Ray; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology of choice for high performanceanalytics in time-critical decision-making applications. Yet while effective technologies forcomplex pattern detection on continuous event streams have been developed; the problemof scalable online aggregation of such patterns has been overlooked. Instead; aggregationis typically applied as a post processing step after CEP pattern detection; leading to anextremely ineffective solution. In this paper; we demonstrate that CEP aggregation can bepushed into the sequence construction process. Based on this insight our A-Seq strategysuccessfully aggregates sequence pattern online without ever constructing sequencematches. This drives down the complexity of the CEP aggregation problem from polynomialto linear. We further extend our A-Seq strategy to support the shared processing of …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,9
Shared execution strategy for neighbor-based pattern mining requests over streaming windows,Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract In diverse applications ranging from stock trading to traffic monitoring; data streamsare continuously monitored by multiple analysts for extracting patterns of interest in real time.These analysts often submit similar pattern mining requests yet customized with differentparameter settings. In this work; we present shared execution strategies for processing alarge number of neighbor-based pattern mining requests of the same type yet with arbitraryparameter settings. Such neighbor-based pattern mining requests cover a broad range ofpopular mining query types; including detection of clusters; outliers; and nearest neighbors.Given the high algorithmic complexity of the mining process; serving multiple such queries ina single system is extremely resource intensive. The naive method of detecting andmaintaining patterns for different queries independently is often infeasible in practice; as …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,9
Qrelx: generating meaningful queries that provide cardinality assurance,Manasi Vartak; Venkatesh Raghavan; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In many business and consumer applications; queries have cardinality constraints.However; current database systems provide minimal support for cardinality assurance.Consequently; users must adopt a cumbersome trial-and-error approach to find queries thatare close to the original query but also attain the desired cardinality. In this demonstration;we present QRelX a novel framework to automatically generate alternate queries that meetthe cardinality and closeness criteria. QRelX employs an innovative query spacetransformation strategy; proximity-based search and incremental cardinality estimation toefficiently find alternate queries. Our demonstration is an interactive game that allows theaudience to compete with QRelX via manual query refinement. We illustrate the importanceof cardinality assurance through real-time comparisons between manual refinement and …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,9
Learning the Relative Importance of Features in Image Data,Aparna Varde; Elke Rundensteiner; Giti Javidi; Ehsan Sheybani; Jianyu Liang,In computational analysis in scientific domains; images are often compared based on theirfeatures; eg; size; depth and other domain-specific aspects. Certain features may be moresignificant than others while comparing the images and drawing corresponding inferencesfor specific applications. Though domain experts may have subjective notions of similarity forcomparison; they seldom have a distance function that ranks the image features based ontheir relative importance. We propose a method called features rank for learning such adistance function in order to capture the semantics of the images. We are given trainingsamples with pairs of images and the extent of similarity identified for each pair. Using aguessed initial distance function. Features rank clusters the given images in levels.

Order-sensitive XML query processing over relational sources: an algebraic approach,Ling Wang; Song Wang; Brian Murphy; Elke A Rundensteiner,The XML data is order-sensitive. The order problem; that is how ordered XML documentsand order-sensitive queries over it can be efficiently supported when mapped into theunordered relational data model; has not yet been adequately addressed. In this paper; wepresent a general approach for supporting order-sensitive XQuery-to-SQL translation thatworks irrespective of the chosen XML-to-relational data mapping and the selected order-encoding method. Our approach; called XSOT; utilizes an order-aware XML algebrarepresentation. We propose order-sensitive rewriting rules at the algebraic level to eliminatethe dependency of the order determining operators on the implicit XML view order.Furthermore; we introduce a series of order-sensitive optimization steps to transform theXML algebra tree for the purpose of efficient SQL translation.

Cost-driven general join view maintenance over distributed data sources,Bin Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner,Maintaining materialized views that have join conditions between arbitrary pairs of datasources possibly with cycles is critical for many applications. In this paper; we model viewmaintenance as the process of answering a set of inter-related distributed multi-join queries.We illustrate two strategies for maintaining as well as optimizing such general join views. Wepropose a cost-driven view maintenance framework which generates optimizedmaintenance plans tuned to a given environmental settings.

The QuenchMiner™ Expert System for Quenching and Distortion Control,Aparna S Varde; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract The QuenchMiner™ Expert System is an enhancement over the original Web-based Data Mining tool developed at CHTE; WPI for analysis of quenching data. The goalsof this Expert System are predicting results obtained under given quenching conditions;thereby supporting decision making to improve performance. It thus assists Heat Treatingusers. It is fed with the knowledge an expert has in the user domain. For example; a humanexpert knows that higher agitation implies greater distortion tendency; cooling rate of aquenchant affects distortion more than the carbon content of the part alloy etc. These factsare converted into rules with priorities and relative weights. The Expert System uses theserules to analyze cases submitted by the user and estimates parameters of interest. The focusis on Quenching Media and Distortion Control.,*,2003,9
SEE: A spatial exploration environment based on a direct-manipulation paradigm,Sudhir R Kaushik; Elke A.  Rundensteiner,The need to provide effective tools for analyzing and querying spatial data is becomingincreasingly important with the explosion of data in applications such as geographicinformation systems; image databases; CAD; and remote sensing. The SEE (SpatialExploration Environment) is the first effort at applying direct-manipulation visual informationseeking (VIS) techniques to spatial data analysis by visually querying as well as browsingspatial data and reviewing the visual results for trend analysis. The SEE system incorporatesa visual query language (SVIQUEL) that allows users to specify the relative spatial position(both topology and direction) between objects using direct manipulation.

SERFing the web: The Re-Web approach for web re-structuring,Li Chen; Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In our emerging digital paper-less society; massive amount of information is beingmaintained in on-line repositories and diverse web site representations of this informationmust be served over the Internet to different user groups. E-commerce and digital librariesare two representative sample applications with such needs. In this paper we present adatabase-centric approach called Re-Web that addresses this need for flexible web sitegeneration; re-structuring; and maintenance. Re-Web is based on two key ideas. First; weexploit the web site structure by associating web semantics (XML equivalents) with themodeling constructs of the ODMG object model to aid the web site generation process. Bycapturing the logical structure of web views within the OODB system; we can efficientlymaintain the web views using standard database techniques. Secondly; to ease the …,World Wide Web,2000,9
View materialization techniques for complex hierarchical objects,Matthew C Jones; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In many design applications; it is common practice to store corn--pfex hierarchicalobjects in a compactfolded form to save storage space and to reduce processing costs foraccessing the objects.

Extending view technology for complex integration tasks,Matthew C Jones; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In this paper; we present extensions to the MultiView object-oriented database viewsystem that improve its ability to integrate electronic computer-aided design (ECAD) tools.Using an object-preserving algebra as the view definition language; the MultiView systemsupports data transformations to suit the needs of individual tools. However; an object-preserving algebra alone is not powerful enough to express recursive transformations suchas transitive path derivations and the flattening of hierarchical structures. In order to providethese capabilities; we extend the view definition language with operators that permitcomplex transformations of the data. To achieve performance essential for ECAD tools; weintroduce the mediator class as a general strategy for the materialization of these complexviews.

Interactive visualizations for temporal analysis: Application to CSCW multimedia data,Stacie Hibino; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Although multimedia data is commonly collected by various researchers for avariety of purposes; previous support for specifying temporal queries and analyzing suchdata for temporal trends has been limited. In this chapter; we present a new paradigm fortemporal analysis—one where users browse the data in search of temporal trends andrelationships by using simple mouse manipulations to incrementally pose temporal querieswithin an integrated MultiMedia Visual Information Seeking (MMVIS) environment. InMMVIS; our specialized temporal visual query language (TVQL) not only allows users topose specific temporal queries based on strict relationships (eg; when A events start at thesame time as B events); but also to relax the constraints to explore similar relationships (eg;when A's start within a few seconds of B's).

Implementation experience with building an object-oriented view management system,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Although views have been found to be important mechanisms for database systems;currently no commercially available OODBMS supports view management tools. There aremany challenging problems related to view management that must be adressed in thecontext of object-oriented models: what features are required to support a view system; howto provide updatable views; and how to utilize the complexity of the object-oriented datamodel for view de nition (such as behavioral customization; view hierarchy manipulation;and incorporating virtual classes into a consistent global schema). We solve all of theseproblems in our implementation of the MultiView view management system; which supportsupdatable views on top of the GemStone OODBMS.

Redoop: Supporting Recurring Queries in Hadoop.,Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Mohamed Y Eltabakh,ABSTRACT The growing demand for large-scale data analytics ranging from onlineadvertisement placement; log processing; to fraud detection; has led to the design of highlyscalable data-intensive computing infrastructures such as the Hadoop platform. Recurringqueries; repeatedly being executed for long periods of time on rapidly evolving high-volumedata; have become a bedrock component in most of these analytic applications. Despitetheir importance; the plain Hadoop along with its state-of-art extensions lack built-in supportfor recurring queries. In particular; they lack efficient and scalable analytics over evolvingdatasets. In this work; we present the Redoop system; an extension of the Hadoopframework; designed to fill in this void. Redoop supports recurring queries as firstclasscitizen in Hadoop without sacrificing any of its core features. More importantly; Redoop …,EDBT,2014,8
Optimizing adaptive multi-route query processing via time-partitioned indices,Karen Works; Elke A Rundensteiner; Emmanuel Agu,Abstract Adaptive multi-route query processing (AMR) is an emerging paradigm forprocessing stream queries in highly fluctuating environments. The content of stream datacan be unpredictable. Thus; instead of selecting a fixed plan; AMR dynamically routesbatches of tuples to operators in the query network based on up-to-date system statistics.The workload of query access patterns in AMR systems is ever changing. Selecting a singlebest index may not efficiently support all query access patterns at all times. Whilemaintaining multiple indices to match a variety of query access patterns increases overheadand decreases throughput. Index design; while paramount for efficient query execution; isparticularly challenging in AMR systems as the indices must serve the continuously evolvingquery access patterns. Our proposed Adaptive Multi-Route Index (AMRI) employs a …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,8
High-performance complex event processing using continuous sliding views,Medhabi Ray; Elke A Rundensteiner; Mo Liu; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Ismail Ari,Abstract Complex Event Processing (CEP) has become increasingly important for trackingand monitoring anomalies and trends in event streams emitted from business processessuch as supply chain management to online stores in e-commerce. These monitoringapplications submit complex event queries to track sequences of events that match a givenpattern. While the state-of-the-art CEP systems mostly focus on the execution of flatsequence queries; we instead support the execution of nested CEP queries specified by the(NEsted Event Language) NEEL. However the iterative execution often results in therepeated recomputation of similar or even identical results for nested subexpressions as thewindow slides over the event stream. In this work we thus propose to optimize NEELexecution performance by caching intermediate results.

Realtime healthcare services via nested complex event processing technology,Mo Liu; Medhabi Ray; Dazhi Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Daniel J Dougherty; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Ismail Ari,Abstract Complex Event Processing (CEP) over event streams has become increasinglyimportant for real-time applications ranging from healthcare to supply chain management. Insuch applications; arbitrarily complex sequence patterns as well as non existence of suchcomplex situations must be detected in real time. To assure real-time responsiveness fordetection of such complex pattern over high volume high-speed streams; efficientprocessing techniques must be designed. Unfortunately the efficient processing of complexsequence queries with negations remains a largely open problem to date. To tackle thisshortcoming; we designed optimized strategies for handling nested CEP query.

Event sequence processing: new models and optimization techniques,Mo Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Many modern applications; including online financial feeds; tag-based mass transitsystems and RFID-based supply chain management systems transmit real-time datastreams. There is a need for a special-purpose event stream processing technology toanalyze this vast amount of sequential multi-dimensional data to enable online; operationaldecision making. Existing techniques such as traditional online analytical processing(OLAP) systems are not designed for real-time pattern-based operations; while state-of-the-art Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems designed for sequence detection do notsupport OLAP operations.

Nugget discovery in visual exploration environments by query consolidation,Di Yang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Queries issued by casual users or specialists exploring a dataset often point us toimportant subsets of the data; be it clusters; outliers or other meaningful features. Capturingand caching such queries (henceforth called nuggets) has many potential benefits; includingthe optimization of the system performance and the search experience of users.Unfortunately; current visual exploration systems have not yet tapped into this potentialresource of identifying and sharing important queries. In this paper; we introduce a queryconsolidation strategy aimed at solving the general problem of isolating important queriesfrom the potentially huge amount of queries submitted.

Extending the object query language for transparent metadata access,Hong Su; Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Many applications in Object Databases (ODB); for example; schema managementtools; CASE tools; database development tools and integration wrappers; need extensivequeries over both application data as well as metadata. However queries over metadata viaOQL; a de-facto standard for object query languages defined for the ODMG 2.0 ObjectModel; are tied to low-level implementation details of the underlying schema repository ofthe database system. Hence; they are neither portable nor easily usable; requiring theapplication developer to have detailed knowledge of the proprietary structure of the schemarepository. In this paper; we propose an extension of OQL; called MetaOQL; to address thislimitation.

Consistent schema version removal: An optimization technique for object-oriented views,Viviane M Crestana-Jensen; Amy J Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner,Powerful solutions enabling interoperability must allow applications to evolve and therequirements of shared databases to change; while minimizing such changes on otherintegrated applications. Several approaches have been proposed to make interoperabilitypossible by using object-oriented techniques. These approaches may generate a largenumber of schema versions over time; resulting in an excessive build-up of classes andunderlying object instances; not all being necessarily still in use. This results in degradationof system performance due to the view maintenance and the storage overhead costs. In thispaper; we address the problem of removing obsolete view schemas.

Path queries for transportation networks: Dynamic reordering and sliding window paging techniques,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract It is well-known that standard relational database engines arc not equipped toefficiently process path finding queries required by diverse applications; such as GeographicInformation Systems (GIS); Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); etc. In this paper; weexplore the development of special-purpose disk-based techniques for supporting theprocessing of path queries on transportation networks. To process high-throughput pathqueries; our solution materializes parh views and employs several innovative p&h viewrcfreshing strategies.

High performance stream query processing with correlation-aware partitioning,Lei Cao; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract State-of-the-art optimizers produce one single optimal query plan for all streamdata; in spite of such a singleton plan typically being sub-optimal or even poor for highlycorrelated data. Recently a new stream processing paradigm; called multi-route approach;has emerged as a promising approach for tackling this problem. Multi-route first divides datastreams into several partitions and then creates a separate query plan for each combinationof partitions. Unfortunately current approaches suffer from severe shortcomings; in particular;the lack of an effective partitioning strategy and the prohibitive query optimization expense.In this work we propose the first practical multi-route optimizer named< u> c</u> orrelation-aware< u> m</u> ulti-< u> r</u> oute stream query optimizer (or CMR) that solves bothproblems.

Quality-aware visual data analysis,Matthew Ward; Zaixian Xie; Di Yang; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract The quality; certainty; or confidence of decisions made during the visual analyticsprocess depends on many factors; including the completeness and reliability of the initialdata; information loss due to filtering; sampling; and other transformations; and the accuracyand clarity of the visual presentation.

In this paper; we illustrate how thestream loading model of our system on the fly conducts XML navigation over the inputstream via concurrently constructing a minimized light-weight XML tree representation;which is called navigation-free data instance. These captured XML fragments are minimizedin terms of buffer consumption. Based on the compact representation of the navigation-freedata instances; we propose techniques for subsequent algebraic query evaluation; inparticular; effective strategies for supporting multi-mode query operators and alternative …,Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Database engineering & applications,2008,7
Semantic query optimization for processing xml streams with minimized memory footprint,Ming Li; Murali Mani; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract XQuery evaluation over XML streams requires the temporary buffering of XMLelements. This paper presents a semantic query optimization solution to minimize memoryfootprint during XQuery evaluation by exploiting schema knowledge. We focus on oneparticular class of constraints; namely; the Pattern Non-Occurrence (PNO) constraints forXML streams conforming to pre-defined DTDs. PNO constraints facilitate the early release ofbuffered data (early buffer release) or possibly avoid to ever store the data (bufferavoidance); thus achieving a minimized memory footprint. We develop an automaton-basedtechnique to detect PNO constraints at runtime. For a given query; optimization opportunitiesof early buffer release and buffer avoidance which can be triggered by runtime PNOdetection are explored and the optimization decision is then encoded into the Raindrop …,Proceedings of the 2008 EDBT workshop on Database technologies for handling XML information on the web,2008,7
Data mining over graphical results of experiments with domain semantics,Aparna Varde; Elke Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; Richard Sisson Jr,Abstract The results of experiments in science and engineering are often representedgraphically; since graphs serve as good visual tools for analysis of the correspondingprocesses to aid decision-making. Performing a laboratory experiment consumes time andresources. This motivates the need to estimate the results (graphs) that would be obtainedfrom experiments given the input conditions. We propose an approach called“AutoDomainMine” for estimation. This consists of first clustering graphical results of existingexperiments; and then using classification to learn the clustering criteria to build arepresentative pair of input conditions and graph per cluster. The representatives and learntcriteria form domain knowledge useful for estimation. We have found that this strategyprovides significantly better estimation compared to similarity search and other methods …,Proceedings of ACM SIGART's 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems ICICIS-05,2005,7
ROVER: flexible yet consistent evolution of relationships,Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner; George T Heineman,Abstract Relationships have been repeatedly identified as an important object-orientedmodeling construct. Most emerging modeling standards such as the object databasemanagement group (ODMG) object model and UML have some support for relationships.However object-oriented database (OODB) systems have largely ignored the existence ofrelationships during schema evolution. We are the first to propose comprehensive supportfor relationship evolution. A complete schema evolution facility for any OODB system mustprovide primitives to manipulate all object model constructs; and maintenance strategies forthe structural and referential integrity of the database under such evolution.

A Formal Model for Rule Inheritance and Overriding in Active Object-Oriented Databases.,Nauman A Chaudhry; James R Moyne; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract: The concept of inheritance is among the most important features of object-orienteddatabases (OODBs). However; no general treatment of rule inheritance and overriding hasbeen undertaken for active OODBs. Such treatment is conspicuously missing for rules thatare defined over multiple classes; even though most active OODBs support the definition ofsuch rules. In this paper; we fill this gap by developing a formal model for rule inheritanceand overriding in active OODBs. We identify important features required in an active OODBmodel; such as support for rule inheritance and rule overriding; and provision of the notion ofsyntactic compatibility. We then define a formal model for active rules by adapting theconcept of multi-methods to define inheritance and overriding of active rules. We extend thenotion of syntactic compatibility to active rules and show how it can be elegantly enforced …,IADT,1998,7

We present a visualquery language (SVIQUEL) which allows us to specify the relative spatial position (bothtopology and direction) between objects using direct manipulation of spatial query filters.The SVIQUEL sliders (S-sliders) are complimented by an Active-Picture-for-Querying (APIQ)providing qualitative visual representations of the quantitative query specified by the S-sliders. This increases the utility of the system for spatial browsing and spatial trenddiscovery with no particular query in mind. The tight coupling between the quantitative S-sliders and qualitative APIQ allows the users to work either qualitatively or quantitatively …,*,1998,7
Probabilistic Real-Time Data Access with Interval Constraints.,Lei Zhou; Kang G Shin; Elke A Rundensteiner; Nandit Soparkar,Abstract Real-time data management for manufacturing control applications indicates aneed for probabilistic deadline guarantees and interval constraints. When shared dataobjects are treated as resources; real-time data management becomes aresourceconstrained real-time scheduling problem. In this paper; we perform simulationsand measurements to evaluate the utilities of existing real-time scheduling algorithms in ourUniversity of Michigan Open-Architecture Controller testbed environment. We exhibit that;among rate-monotonic; first-infirst-out and earliest-deadline-first; none can consistentlyoutperform the others in terms of miss ratio. To satisfy interval constraints in the presence oftimer interval variance and “memory;” resetting timers is intuitively helpful. However; we findthat it is not a viable approach even when the associated overhead is negligible. Rate …,RTDB,1996,7
Towards supporting hard schema changes in TSE,Young-Gook Ra; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Simulating schema evoiution using views offers many advantages over the directmodification of the schema. However; this view approach towards transparent schemaevolution has not yet been implemented. One reason for this may be that views can 'tsimulate capacity-augmenting schema changes due to the inherent limitation of viewmechanisms that do not augment the underlying schema. One potential solution for thisproblem is to develop capac@-augmenhngview support. However; existing 00 viewmechanisms do currently not support this capacityaugmenting feature. This paper thusproposes an alternative; more practical; solution to this problem. This solution is neitherconfined to object-preserving schema changes nor requires capacdy-augmentmg views.Note that our proposed solution is the first to aJso support hard changes such as …,Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1995,7

Sharing-aware outlier analytics over high-volume data streams,Lei Cao; Jiayuan Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Real-time analytics of anomalous phenomena on streaming data typically relies onprocessing a large variety of continuous outlier detection requests; each configured withdifferent parameter settings. The processing of such complex outlier analytics workloads isresource consuming due to the algorithmic complexity of the outlier mining process. In thiswork we propose a sharing-aware multi-query execution strategy for outlier detection ondata streams called SOP. A key insight of SOP is to transform the problem of handling a multi-query outlier analytics workload into a single-query skyline computation problem. We provethat the output of the skyline computation process corresponds to the minimal informationneeded for determining the outlier status of any point in the stream. Based on this newformulation; we design a customized skyline algorithm called K-SKY that leverages the …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,6
Active complex event processing infrastructure: Monitoring and reacting to event streams,Di Wang; Elke Rundensteiner; Richard T Ellison; Han Wang,State-of-the-art Complex Event Processing technology (CEP); while effective for patternmatching on event streams; is limited in its capability of reacting in real-time to opportunitiesand risks detected when monitoring the physical or virtual world. We propose to tackle thisproblem by embedding active rule support within the CEP engine; henceforth called ActiveComplex Event Processing technology; or short; ACEP. We design an ACEP infrastructurethat integrates the active rule component into the CEP kernel. This not only allows fine-grained but also more efficient rule processing. Based on the infrastructure we developoptimization techniques to improve the responsiveness of our system. We demonstrate thepower of ACEP technology by applying it to the development of our real-time healthcaresystem being deployed in Univ. of Massachusetts Medical School hospital.

Constraint-aware complex event pattern detection over streams,Ming Li; Murali Mani; Elke A Rundensteiner; Tao Lin,Abstract In this paper; we propose a framework for constraint-aware pattern detection overevent streams. Given the constraint of the input streams; our proposed framework on the flychecks the query satisfiability/unsatisfiability using a lightweight reasoning mechanism.Based on the constraint specified in the input stream; we are able to adjust the processingstrategy dynamically; by producing early feedbacks; releasing unnecessary systemresources and terminating corresponding pattern monitor; thus effectively decreasing theresource consumption and expediting the system response on certain situations. Ourexperimental study illustrates the significant performance improvement achieved by theconstraint-aware pattern detection framework with little overhead.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,6

Automaton in or out: Run-time plan optimization for xml stream processing,Hong Su; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract Many systems such as Tukwila and YFilter combine automaton and algebratechniques to process queries over tokenized XML streams. Typically in this architecture; anautomaton is first used to locate all query patterns in the input stream and compose thematched tokens into XML element nodes. These XML nodes are then passed to the tuple-based algebraic operators for further filtering or restructuring. This common processing styleis however not always optimal. At times it is more efficient to retrieve only a subset of thepatterns in the automaton while retrieving the rest of the patterns on the XML element nodes.In this paper; we use a cost-based solution to explore this novel optimization opportunity.

Integrating data and quality space interactions in exploratory visualizations,Zaixian Xie; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner; Shiping Huang,Data quality is an important topic for many fields because real-world data is rarely perfect.Analysis conducted on data of variable quality can lead to inaccurate or incorrect results. Toavoid this problem; researchers have introduced visual elements and attributes intotraditional visualization displays to represent data quality information in conjunction with theoriginal data. However; little work thus far has focused on creating an interactive interface toenable users to explicitly explore that data quality information. In this paper; we propose aframework for the linkage between data space and quality space for multivariatevisualizations. Moreover; we introduce two novel techniques; quality brushing and quality-series animation; to help users with the exploration of this linkage.

Estimating Heat Transfer Coefficients as a Function of Temperature by Data Mining,Aparna S Varde; Elke A Rundensteiner; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; Richard D Sisson Jr,Abstract This paper describes our proposed technique AutoDomainMine that performs datamining guided by fundamental knowledge of the domain. The data being mined consists ofinput conditions from quenching experiments and the resulting heat transfer curves; ie; plotsof heat transfer coefficients versus part temperature. Since heat transfer coefficientscharacterize quenching; the estimation assists decision-making. This avoids runninglaboratory experiments which consume considerable time and resources. AutoDomainMineintegrates two data mining techniques; clustering and classification; into a learning strategy.It clusters curves resulting from existing experiments and uses decision tree classifiers tolearn the clustering criteria; ie; input conditions characterizing the clusters.

Seamless integration of diverse data types into exploratory visualization systems,Anilkumar Patro; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Visual data exploration involves presenting data in some graphical form andallowing the human to interactively gain insight into the data. Visual data explorationtechniques have proven to be very useful for exploratory data analysis; especially for mininglarge databases. However; the lack of explicit content semantics within the framework of thevisualization tool makes interpretation of the visualizations difficult at times. The aim of ourresearch is the development of a comprehensive framework for integrating semantics of datainto an existing visualization tool in a flexible yet minimally intrusive manner. The first stageof the framework involves a transformation process that enables the mapping between awide range of data types to a form the visualization system can process.

B+ Retake: Sustaining high volume inserts into large data pages,Kurt W Deschler; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Modern ad-hoc data mining queries often run on databases over a terabyte in size.At this scale; large data pages are required to obtain sufficient disk performance.Unfortunately; these large data pages greatly increase update costs; especially for packedstructures such as the B+ tree. In a frequently updated warehouse; users are often forced todecide between query performance and update performance in order to meet maintenancetime windows. Solutions that provide both are welcome. In this paper; we analyze andmeasure the memory related costs of B+ Tree updates with large data pages. We introducethe RB+(Red-Black+) tree as a practical replacement for the B+ tree. The RB+ tree usespersistent red-black binary trees instead of sorted records for leaf pages.

History-driven view synchronization,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Views over distributed information sources rely on the stability of the schemas ofthese underlying sources. In the event of meta data changes in the sources; such as thedeletion of a table or column; such views may become undefined. Using meta data aboutinformation redundancy and user preferences; views can be evolved as necessary to bedefined on a modified information space after a source meta data change; while assuringthe best possible compliance to preferences that users may have. Previous work in viewsynchronization focused only on deletions of schema elements. We now offer the firstapproach that makes use of additions also. The algorithm is based partly on returning viewdefinitions to previous versions by “backtracking” in the history of views and meta data. Thistechnology enables us to adapt views to temporary meta data changes by cancelling out …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2000,6

Enhancing Existing Incremental View Maintenance Algorithms Using the Multi-Relation Encapsulation Wrapper,Lingli Ding; Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehouses (DW) are built by gathering information from several informationsources (ISs) and integrating and materializing it into one repository customized to users'sneeds. Some of the most recently proposed algorithms for the incremental maintenance ofsuch materialized DWs; such as SWEEP and PSWEEP; offer several significant advantagesover previous solutions; such as high-performance; no potential for infinite waits andreduced remote queries and thus reduced network and IS loads. However; similar to manyother algorithms; they still have the restricting assumption that each IS can be composed ofjust one single relation. This is unrealistic in practice. In this paper; we hence propose asolution to overcome this restriction.

TSE relieves users of the risk of making existingapplication programs obsolete when run against the modified schema; because the old viewschema is maintained while a new view schema is generated to capture the changesdesired by the user. However TSE may be generating a large number of schema versions(object-oriented view schemata) over time; resulting in an excessive build-up of classes andunderlying object instances-some of which may potentially no longer be in use.

Due to commonevent sub-sequences in CETs; either the responsiveness is delayed by repeatedcomputations or an exorbitant amount of memory is required to store partial results. Toovercome these limitations; we define the CET graph to compactly encode all CETs matchedby a query. Based on the graph; we define the spectrum of CET detection algorithms fromCPU-optimal to memory-optimal. We find the middle ground between these two extremes bypartitioning the graph into time-centric graphlets and caching partial CETs per graphlet toenable effective reuse of these intermediate results.

The detection of these multifaceted relationships;especially time warped matching of time series of different lengths and alignments isprohibitively expensive to compute. To achieve real time responsiveness on large timeseries datasets; we propose a novel paradigm called Online Exploration of Time Series(ONEX) employing a powerful one-time preprocessing step that encodes critical similarityrelationships to support subsequent rapid data exploration. Since the encoding of a hugenumber of pairwise similarity relationships for all variable lengths time series segments isnot feasible; our work rests on the important insight that clustering with inexpensive point-to-point distances such as the Euclidean Distance can support subsequent time warped …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,5

In this work; we propose a novel live streammatching framework; called n-Snippet Indices Framework (in short; SNIF); to tackle thesechallenges. SNIF employs snippets as the basic unit for matching streaming time-series. Theinsight is to perform the matching at two levels of granularity: bag matching of subsets ofsnippets of the live stream against prefixes of the patterns; and order checking for …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,5
Comparing mathematical and heuristic approaches for scientific data analysis,Aparna S Varde; Shuhui Ma; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; David C Brown; Elke A Rundensteiner; Richard D SissonJR,Abstract Scientific data is often analyzed in the context of domain-specific problems; forexample; failure diagnostics; predictive analysis; and computational estimation. Theseproblems can be solved using approaches such as mathematical models or heuristicmethods. In this paper we compare a heuristic approach based on mining stored data with amathematical approach based on applying state-of-the-art formulae to solve an estimationproblem. The goal is to estimate results of scientific experiments given their input conditions.We present a comparative study based on sample space; time complexity; and data storagewith respect to a real application in materials science. Performance evaluation with realmaterials science data is also presented; taking into account accuracy and efficiency. Wefind that both approaches have their pros and cons in computational estimation. Similar …,AI EDAM,2008,5
Mining images of material nanostructure data,Aparna Varde; Jianyu Liang; Elke Rundensteiner; Richard Sisson,Abstract Scientific datasets often consist of complex data types such as images. Mining suchdata presents interesting issues related to semantics. In this paper; we explore the researchissues in mining data from the field of nanotechnology. More specifically; we focus on aproblem that relates to image comparison of material nanostructures. A significant challengehere relates to the notion of similarity between the images. Features such as size and heightof nano-particles and inter-particle distance are important in image similarity as conveyed bydomain experts. However; there are no precise notions of similarity defined apriori. Hencethere is a need for learning similarity measures. In this paper; we describe our proposedapproach to learn similarity measures for graphical data. We discuss this with reference tonanostructure images. Other challenges in image comparison are also outlined. The use …,International Conference on Distributed Computing and Internet Technology,2006,5
Designing semantics-preserving cluster representatives for scientific input conditions,Aparna S Varde; Elke A Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz; David C Brown; Mohammmed Maniruzzaman; Richard D Sisson,Abstract In scientific domains; knowledge is often discovered from experiments by groupingor clustering them based on the similarity of their output. The causes of similarity areanalyzed based on the input conditions characterizing a given type of output; ie; a givencluster. This analysis helps in applications such as decision support in industry. Clusterrepresentatives form at-a-glance depictions for such applications. Randomly selecting a setof conditions in a cluster as its representative is not sufficient since distinct combinations ofinputs could lead to the same cluster. In this paper; an approach called DesCond isproposed to design semantics-preserving cluster representatives for scientific inputconditions. We define a notion of distance for conditions to capture semantics based on thetypes of their attributes and their relative importance. Using this distance; methods of …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,5
Effectiveness of domain-specific cluster representatives for graphical plots,A Varde; E Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz; David C Brown; Mohammmed Maniruzzaman; R Sisson Jr,ABSTRACT Experimental results in scientific domains are often plotted as graphs of processvariables. Clustering such graphs is useful for applications such as process comparison inwhich cluster representatives form at-a-glance depictions of each cluster. Randomlyselected representatives are seldom effective in incorporating semantics; user interests andease of interpretation. Hence there is a need to design domainspecific representatives.Users cannot always evaluate the design due to lack of time; huge volumes of experimentaldata and vague notions of effectiveness. Hence there is a need to automate evaluationsusing objective effectiveness measures. In this paper; we propose an approach calledDesGraph that designs and evaluates domain-specific cluster representatives of graphs.Design is based on guided selection and construction giving candidates such as medoid …,SIGMOD IQIS,2006,5
A history-driven approach at evolving views under meta data changes,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Views over distributed information sources; such as data warehouses; rely on thestability of the schemas of underlying databases. In the event of meta data changes in thesources; such as the deletion of a table or column; such views may become undefined.Using meta data about information redundancy; views can be evolved as necessary toremain well defined after source meta data changes. Previous work in view synchronizationfocused only on deletions of schema elements. We now offer an approach that makes use ofadditions also. Our algorithm returns view definitions to previous versions by usingknowledge about the history of views and meta data. This technology enables us to adaptviews to temporary meta data changes by canceling out opposite changes. It also allowsundo/redo operations on meta data.

Restructuring view maintenance plans for large update batches,Bin Liu; Elke A Rundensteiner; David Finkel,Abstract Materialized views defined over distributed data sources are a well recognizedtechnology in data integration; e-business and semantic web. Due to the constantlyincreasing size of the information sources and the rapid rates of change; there comes anincreasing pressure to reduce the time taken for refreshing such integration views. State-of-the-art incremental view maintenance literature requires O (n2)(batch view maintenance) ormore (ie; sequential maintenance) maintenance queries with n is the number of datasources. In this work; we optimize the maintenance performance by restructuring the batchview maintenance plan to reduce the number of maintenance queries to remote datasources when maintaining a large set of updates. We first propose an adjacent groupingstrategy which exploits the regularity in the batch maintenance plan. This solution …,In CIKM; Poster,2003,5

SERF: Schema Evolution through an Extensible; Re-usable and Flexible Framework,Jin Jing; Kajal T Claypool; Jing Jin; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract With current database technology trends; there is an increasing need to specify andhandle complex schema changes. The existing support for schema evolution in currentOODB systems is limited to a pre-defined taxonomy of schema evolution operations withfixed semantics. Given the variety of types; complexity; and semantics of transformations; it issheer impossible to a-priori provide a complete set of all complex changes that are going tomeet all user's needs. This paper is the first effort to successfully address this open problemby providing an extensible framework for schema transformations.

Route guidance support in intelligent transportation systems: an encoded path view approach,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract E cient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identi ed as one ofthe key requirements for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. While thecurrent ITS literature has focused on the application of search algorithms (typically; heuristicA* algorithms) to provide for compute-on-demand path nding; we propose an encoded pathview approach that precomputes optimal paths. Advantages of our approach include (1)route search is e cient and less dependent on system load;(2) alternative paths arematerialized in addition to the optimal paths; simplifying the process of globaloptimization;(3) the storage overhead is manageable and less than for the full enumerationof all possible paths.

SPIRE: supporting parameter-driven interactive rule mining and exploration,Xika Lin; Abhishek Mukherji; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract We demonstrate our SPIRE technology for supporting interactive mining of bothpositive and negative rules at the speed of thought. It is often misleading to learn only aboutpositive rules; yet extremely revealing to find strongly supported negative rules. Keytechnical contributions of SPIRE including region-wise abstractions of rules; positive-negative rule relationship analysis; rule redundancy management and rule visualizationsupporting novel exploratory queries will be showcased. The audience can interactivelyexplore complex rule relationships in a visual manner; such as comparing negative ruleswith their positive counterparts; that would otherwise take prohibitive time. Overall; ourSPIRE system provides data analysts with rich insights into rules and rule relationshipswhile significantly reducing manual effort and time investment required.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,4
Lovis: Local pattern visualization for model refinement,Kaiyu Zhao; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner; Huong N Higgins,Abstract Linear models are commonly used to identify trends in data. While it is an easy taskto build linear models using pre-selected variables; it is challenging to select the bestvariables from a large number of alternatives. Most metrics for selecting variables are globalin nature; and thus not useful for identifying local patterns. In this work; we present anintegrated framework with visual representations that allows the user to incrementally buildand verify models in three model spaces that support local pattern discovery andsummarization: model complementarity; model diversity; and model representivity. Visualrepresentations are designed and implemented for each of the model spaces.

Probabilistic inference of object identifications for event stream analytics,Di Wang; Elke Rundensteiner; Richard Ellison III; Han Wang,Abstract Recent years have witnessed the emergence of real-time object monitoringapplications driven by the explosion of small inexpensive sensors. In many real-worldapplications; not all sensed events carry the identification of the object whose action theyreport on; so called" non-ID-ed" events. Reasons range from heterogeneous sensingdevices to human's choosing to conceal their identifications. Such non-ID-ed events preventus from performing object-based analytics; such as tracking; alerting and pattern matching.We propose a probabilistic inference framework; called FISS; to tackle this problem byinferring the missing object identification associated with an event. Specifically; as afoundation we design a time-varying graphic model to capture correspondences betweensensed events and objects.

A new look at generating multi-join continuous query plans: A qualified plan generation problem,Yali Zhu; Venkatesh Raghavan; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract State-of-the-art relational and continuous algorithms alike have focused onproducing optimal or near-optimal query plans by minimizing a single cost function.However; ensuring accurate yet real-time responses for stream processing applicationsnecessitates that the system identifies qualified rather than optimal query plans–with theformer guaranteeing that their utilization of both the CPU and the memory resources stayswithin their respective system capacities. In such scenarios; being optimal in one resourceusage while out-of-bound in the other is not viable. Our experimental study illustrates that tobe effective a qualified plan optimizer must explore an extended plan search space calledthe jtree space composed not only of the standard mjoin and binary join plans; but also ofgeneral join trees with mixed operator types.

Multi-join continuous query optimization: Covering the spectrum of linear; acyclic; and cyclic queries,Venkatesh Raghavan; Yali Zhu; Elke A Rundensteiner; Daniel Dougherty,Abstract Traditional optimization algorithms that guarantee optimal plans have exponentialtime complexity and are thus not viable in streaming contexts. Continuous query optimizerscommonly adopt heuristic techniques such as Adaptive Greedy to attain polynomial-timeexecution. However; these techniques are known to produce optimal plans only for linearand star shaped join queries. Motivated by the prevalence of acyclic; cyclic and evencomplete query shapes in stream applications; we conduct an extensive experimental studyof the behavior of the state-of-the-art algorithms. This study has revealed that heuristic-based techniques tend to generate sub-standard plans even for simple acyclic join queries.For general acyclic join queries we extend the classical IK approach to the streaming contextto define an algorithm TreeOpt that is guaranteed to find an optimal plan in polynomial …,British National Conference on Databases,2009,4

Index tuning for parameterized streaming groupby queries,Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Similar groupby queries are common in many stream processing applications.

To handle high-speed data streamsand large numbers of PSGB queries; the IMP index is proposed for organizing the quicklyevolving PSGB operator state to support query workloads. In this paper; we tackle the IMPindex tuning problem. We propose the EPrune algorithm that is guaranteed to find theoptimal IMP index configuration for a given query workload. To support frequent index tuningrequired for coping with dynamic stream environments; efficiency of index selectionbecomes more important than guaranteed optimality.

An optimized two-step solution for updating XML views,Ling Wang; Ming Jiang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract View updating is a long standing difficult problem. Given a view defined over basedata sources and a view update; there are several different updates over the base datasources; called translations; that perform the update. A translation is said to be correct if itperforms the update and at the same time does not update any portion of the view notspecified in the update (no view side-effects). The view update problem finds a correcttranslation for a given view update if one exists. In the relational scenario; previous researchhas attempted to study the view update problem either by utilizing only the schemaknowledge; or by directly examining the base data. While utilizing only the schemaknowledge is very efficient; we are not guaranteed to find a correct translation even if oneexists. On the other hand; examining the base data is guaranteed to find a correct …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,4
Updating Views Over Recursive XML.,Ming Jiang; Ling Wang; Murali Mani; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract We study the problem of updating XML views defined over XML documents. A viewupdate is performed by finding the base updates over the underlying data sources thatachieve the desired view update. If such base updates do not exist; the view update is saidto be untranslatable and rejected. In SQL; determining whether a view update is translatableis performed using schema level analysis; where the view definition and the base schemaare used. XML schemas are more complex than SQL schemas; and can specify recursivetypes and cardinality constraints. There are two kinds of view updates: single view elementupdate; where the user requires for an update over a particular view element; and a set ofview elements update; where the user requires for an update over all view elements thatsatisfy a given XPath over the view. Accordingly; we propose one solution for each kind of …,EROW,2007,4
LearnMet: learning domain-specific distance metrics for plots of scientific functions,Aparna Varde; Elke Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; Richard Sisson,Abstract Scientific experimental results are often depicted as plots of functions to aid theirvisual analysis and comparison. In computationally comparing these plots using techniquessuch as similarity search and clustering; the notion of similarity is typically distance.However; it is seldom known which distance metric (s) best preserve (s) semantics in therespective domain. It is thus desirable to learn such domain-specific distance metrics for thecomparison of plots. This paper describes a technique called LearnMet proposed to learnsuch metrics. The input to LearnMet is a training set with actual clusters of plots. These areiteratively compared with clusters over the same plots predicted using an arbitrary but fixedclustering algorithm.

Load shedding in XML streams,Mingzhu Wei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract Because of the high volume and unpredictability arrival of data streams; streamprocessing systems may not always be able to keep up with the input—resulting in bufferoverflow and uncontrolled loss of data. Load shedding; the prevalent strategy for solving thisoverflow problem; has todate been considered for relational stream engines. On the otherhand face additional challenges and opportunities for” structural shedding”; due to thecomplex nested XML input and result structures. We now tackle this open XML sheddingproblem by a three-pronged solution. First; we develop a preference model for XQuery toenable users to specify the relative importance of preserving different subpattern in thecomplex XML result structure. This transforms shedding into the problem of rewriting theuser query into possibly several shedding queries that return approximate query answers …,*,2007,4

Sustaining software interoperability via shared; evolving object repositories: System optimization and evaluation,Viviane M Crestana; Amy J Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Powerful interoperability-enabling solutions for software application integrationmust allow applications to evolve and data requirements to change; while minimizing suchchanges on other integrated applications. Thus; we have developed the transparent schemaevolution (TSE) system that accomplishes evolution by generating a new object-orientedview schema to capture the changes desired by the user; while preserving existing viewschemas for old applications. This generation of a potentially large number of schemaversions over time results in an excessive build-up of classes and underlying objectinstances-some of which may no longer be in use. The presence of no-longer-utilized viewschemas will result in storage overhead costs and a degradation of system performance dueto the update propagation of our materialized view foundation.

The satisfiability-indicating multi-index organization for maintaining materialized path query oodb views,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Materialized database views allow applications to benefit from the powerfulflexibility of views while minimizing the performance penalties traditionally associated withviews. However; the need to maintain materialized views in the face of updates limits thevariety of queries that can be used to define them. In this paper we address the problem ofincrementally maintaining OODB views formed using path queries. Traditional indexorganizations are not well suited for this task. The indexing needs of the path query viewproblem are unique in that because the contents of the materialized view are cached andcan be queried directly; the primary use for a supplemental index is during the propagationof updates rather than during query processing. Furthermore; traditional index organizationsdo not distinguish between single-valued and multi-valued attributes; and thus do not …,Materialized Path Query OODB Views; Univ. of Mich; Technical Report; CSE-TR302-96,1996,4

Our object model lays the foundation forthe implementation of meta-classes required to support hierarchical set operations. Forexample; the algebra defined over the data model allows the implicit unfolding ofhierarchical sets; providing users with a (virtual) flattened and unfolded view of shared datawithout the penalty of having to maintain replicated data.

In TSE; users interface with theOODB exclusively through their customized database view. In this paper; we identify keyfeatures required from OODB systems in order to provide such transparent schema changesupport; including multiple classification; dynamic reclassification; and flexible restructuring.Such features are currently not supported by commercial OODB systems.

However neither approach considers that tuplesignificance can be multi-tiered nor that significance determination can be costly. Theseapproaches consider all tuples not dropped to be equally significant. Unlike these priorworks; we take a fresh stance by pulling the most significant tuples forward throughout thequery pipeline.

Optimizing complex sequence pattern extraction using caching,Medhabi Ray; Mo Liu; Elke Rundensteiner; Daniel J Dougherty; Chetan Gupta; Song Wang; Abhay Mehta; Ismail Ari,Complex Event Processing (CEP) has become increasingly important for tracking andmonitoring complex event anomalies and trends in event streams emitted from businessprocesses such as supply chain management to online stores in e-commerce.

The state-of-the-art CEP systems mostly focus on the execution of flatsequence queries; we instead support the execution of nested CEP queries specified by ourNEsted Event Language NEEL. However; the iterative execution of nested CEP expressionsoften results in the repeated recomputation of the same or similar results for nestedsubexpressions as the window slides over the event stream.

This is achieved by incrementally maintaining aprecomputed skyline result space at a higher level of abstraction and digging into the …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,3

Efficient XML processing with orderconsideration over relational storage is non-trivial; especially for complex nested XQueryexpressions. The order semantics may impede efficient query rewriting for nested queryblocks. We propose a general order-sensitive XQuery processing approach involving threesteps. First an algorithm is proposed for inferencing about and then isolating the ordersemantics in XQuery expressions specified over virtual XML views. This turns an orderedXQuery plan into an unordered one decorated with minimized order context annotations.Then without loss of semantics; logical optimization via XQuery rewriting can be easilyapplied to this transformed query plan.

VAMANA-a scalable cost-driven XPath engine,Venkatesh Raghavan; Kurt Deschler; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract¡ Several systems have recently been proposed for the evaluation of XPathexpressions. However; none of these systems have demonstrated both scalability with largedocument sizes and robust support for the XPath language. Many of the scalability problemscan be attributed to inadequate use of indexing during query evaluation. While poor supportfor the XPath language is often a consequence of an architecture overly optimized for certainqueries. Finally; the proposed systems fail to adequately address costing with respect toquery optimizations. We present VAMANA as a solution for a cost driven and scalableevaluation of ad-hoc XPath expressions. VAMANA's index-oriented query plans allowqueries to be evaluated while reading only a fraction of the data. VAMANA's pipelined queryframework minimizes the cost of intermediate query processing while providing cost …,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,3
Semantic Extensions to Domain-Specific Markup Languages,Aparna Varde; Elke Rundensteiner; Murali Mani; Mohammed Maniruzzaman; Richard D Sisson Jr,ABSTRACT A markup language serves as a medium of communication for storing andpublishing textual; numeric and other forms of data seamlessly. XML; the eXtensible MarkupLanguage has become the lingua franca in web publishing. It is also a widely acceptedstandard for databases and document storage. There are many domain-specific markuplanguages designed using special XML tag sets. Standardization bodies and researchcommunities may extend these to include additional semantics of areas within and related tothe domain. This paper outlines the issues to be considered when extending domain-specific markup languages; namely; the motivation for extension; the semanticconsiderations; the syntactic constraints and other relevant aspects.

AUP: adaptive change propagation across data model boundaries,Kajal Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Although databases focus on the longevity of data; rarely is this data or its structurestatic. This is particularly true in some domains such as the protein databases that haveseen and continue to see an exponential growth rate. Managing the effects of change onderived information (views; web pages) and on applications has been recognized as animportant problem. Previous research efforts have developed techniques to both propagatesources changes to views as well as techniques to hide the change from the views and otherdependent applications. While this continues to be an active area of research; the problemof management of the effects of change is further compounded by the semantic and thestructural heterogeneity that in practice often exists between the source and the derivedtarget information. In this work we now examine and address the problem of change …,British National Conference on Databases,2004,3

Updating XQuery Views Published over Relational Data,Ling Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract XML data management using relational database systems has been intensivelystudied in the last few years. However; in order for such systems to be viable; they mustsupport not only queries; but also updates over virtual XML views that wrap the relationalbase. While view updating is a long-standing difficult issue in the relational context; therecent invention of the flexible XML data model and nested XML query language poses newchallenges for view updating. In this paper; we first formally model the XQuery View UpdateProblem. Then the clean extended-source theory for determining the existence of arelational update translation for a given XQuery view update is proposed. We identify newupdate translation issues; in particular view construction consistency; update granularity andview duplication; which are caused by the distinct features of XML; most notably; the XML …,*,2003,3
A lightweight xml constraint check and update framework,Hong Su; Bintou Kane; Victor Chen; Cuong Diep; De Ming Guan; Jennifer Look; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Support for updating XML documents has recently attracted interest. When an XMLdocument is to conform to a given schema; the problem of structural consistency arisesduring updating; ie; how to incrementally guarantee that the modified XML documentcontinues to conform to the given XML Schema. To achieve this following the traditionaldatabase approach; the XML Schema would first have to be analyzed to construct astructured repository and the XML documents would have to be loaded into this repositorybefore any update could be checked for possible schema constraint violation. Due to thevery nature of XML being lightweight and freely shared over the Web; we instead propose anovel approach towards incremental constraint checking that follows the loosely-coupledweb paradigm. Namely; we propose to rewrite an XML update query into a safe XML …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2002,3
MASS: A Multi-Axis Storage Structure for Large XML Documents,Kurt W Deschler; EA Rundensteiner,Abstract Due to the wide acceptance of the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XPathlanguage specification; native indexing for XML is needed to support path expressionqueries efficiently. XPath describes the different document tree relationships that may bequeried as a set of axes. Many recent proposals for XML indexing focus on accelerating onlya small subset of expressions possible using these axes. In particular; queries by ordinalposition and updates that alter document structure are not well supported. A more generalindexing solution is needed that not only offers efficient evaluation of all of the XPath axes;but also allows for efficient document update. We introduce MASS; a Multiple Axis StorageStructure; to meet the performance challenge posed by the XPath language. MASS is astorage and indexing solution for large XML documents that eliminates the need for …,*,2002,3
Prefetching for visual data exploration,Punit R Doshi; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward; Daniel Stroe,Abstract More and more modern computer applications from business decision support toscientific data analysis utilize visualization techniques to support exploratory activities forlarge datasets. Various tools have been proposed in the past decade that help users betterinterpret data using such display techniques. However; such exploratory visualization toolsdo not scale well when applied to huge datasets. Various features provided by databasemanagement systems must be applied to such applications to scale them for huge datasets.To improve the performance of such visualization systems; caching the data at client side isnecessary. We exploit semantic caching for the advantages if offers over the traditionalcaching systems. To further improve the performance; we propose to exploit characteristicsof visualization environments to prefetch the data for the visualization tools. We have …,*,2002,3
SERFing the Web: web site management made easy,Elke A Rundensteiner; Kajal T Claypool; Li Chen; Hong Su; Keiji Oenoki,In the era of electronic publishing; there is a need for a comprehensive Web SiteManagement System (WSMS) that provides an end-to-end solution ranging from integrationof web sites to re-structuring and maintenance of new customized web views.

APIX: An Efficient Approach to Maintain Web Views,Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Due to the increase of web data; web view mechanisms are extensively employedto serve customized data views to users. They are usually materialized to achieve fast queryresponse time. However; developing maintenance techniques for materialized web viewsover dynamic web data sources becomes more challenging than in the conventionaldatabase context. To compute web view" patches" for incremental maintenance; a largenumber of accesses back to base data is usually inevitable. This could cause a severeperformance penalty due to the heavy network overhead and the intense contention for basedata. In this paper; we address this problem for views defined over XML-based data sourcesspecified in an XQL-like query language. We demonstrate how the requirements of such aquery can be represented by means of a query graph. We propose a novel index scheme …,*,2000,3
Incremental maintenance of materialized path query views,Elke A Rundensteiner; Harumi A Kuno; Yijing Zhou,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of incrementally maintaining object-orienteddatabase (OODB) views formed using path queries. We demonstrate that traditional indicesorganizations; designed for query support; are not well suited for this task. As a solution; weintroduce a new Satisfiability Indicating Multi-Index (SMX) organization; which maintainspartial information indicating whether or not a given endpoint satisfies the query predicaterather than what the exact value of the endpoint is. We have implemented SMX as well ascompeting index structures in the Multi View OODB system over Gemstone; and conductedexperiments on this system. The results of our evaluations indicate that the SMX dramaticallyimproves upon the performance of traditional indices.,*,1998,3
Using Complex Substitution Strategies for View Synchronization,Anisoara Nica; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Large-scale information systems typically contain autonomous information sources(ISs) that dy-namically modify their content interfaces as well as their query servicesregardless of the data ware-houses (views) that are built on top of them Current viewtechnology fails to provide adaptation techniques for such changes giving support to onlystatic views in the sense that views become unde-fined when ISs undergo capabilitychanges We propose to address this new view evolution problem-which we call viewsynchronization-by allowing view definitions to be dynamically evolved when they becomeundefined The foundations of our approach to view synchronization include the Evolvable-SQL view definition language (E-SQL) the model for information source description (MISD)and the concept of legal view rewritings In this paper we now introduce the concept of the …,*,1998,3
Schema Version Removal: Optimizing Transparent Schema Evolution Systems,Viviane M Crestana; Amy J Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner,Powerful interoperability-enabling solutions for software application integration must allowapplications to evolve and data requirements to change; while minimizing such changes onother integrated applications. The transparent schema evolution system TSE; that wedeveloped at the University of Michigan; accomplishes evolution through schemaversioning; where a schema version is a dynamic object-oriented view. When the TSEsystem receives a view schema change request; the system computes a new view schemathat reflects the desired change instead of modifying the old view schema in place; thereforepreserving existing view schemas for old applications. This generation of a potentially largenumber of schema versions over time results in an excessive build-up of classes andunderlying object instances; not all being necessarily still in use.

Utilizing fuzzy data and rules for discrete control of semiconductor manufacturing processes,Nauman Chaudhry; James Moyne; E Rundensteiner,Semiconductor wafer fabrication is a very complex manufacturing process. Manysemiconductor processes are not very well understood. The control of semiconductormanufacturing processes is; thus; an active research area. Even though various algorithmshave been developed for process control and optimization; the scope of application of thesealgorithms is not very well-characterized due to the complexity of the semiconductormanufacturing processes. However; information about the applicability of these algorithmscan be gathered from various sources and can be roughly expressed in terms of rules ofvarious types that relate the applicability of different algorithms to process conditions. Wehave applied fuzzy set theory to develop a multi-algorithm control system which can exploitthis knowledge from multiple sources to make better control decisions.

Path View Algorithm for Transportation Networks: Dynamic Reordering Approach,Yun-Wu Huang; Ning Jing; Elke A Rundensteiner,E cient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identi ed as one of the keyrequirements for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). We present a new path viewalgorithm that computes the materialized path view for an ITS graph database in order to eciently support a large number of path queries. Based on breadth-rst traversal; this algorithmcomputes single-source path views iteratively for each node in the graph. It deploys adynamic reordering technique to prevent I/O from deteriorating for inter-single-sourcecomputation; trading o reordering I/O with increased page misses. For intra-single-sourcecomputation; it uses the sliding window method to optimize the paging activity.

Using social sensing to discover trends in public emotion,Maryam Hasan; Elke Rundensteiner; Xiangnan Kong; Emmanuel Agu,The rapid growth of social media; such as twitter; provides a great opportunity for identifyingand analyzing people's emotions in response to various public events; such as epidemics;terrorist attacks and political elections. Detecting the emotions of people on different eventsare crucial in many applications. However; the high volume and fast pace of social mediamake it challenging to analyze public emotions from social media data in real-time. In thispaper we propose a method to measure public emotion and predict important momentsduring particular public events. Given a stream of tweets; we analyze the impact of majorpublic events; both tragic and enthusiastic ones; on public emotion. We develop a full-stackarchitecture that performs real-time emotion analysis on Twitter streams.

Multi-query outlier detection over data streams: poster,Lei Cao; Jiayuan Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Real-time analytics of anomalous phenomena on streaming data typically relies onprocessing a large variety of continuous outlier detection requests; each configured withdifferent parameter settings. The processing of such complex outlier analytics workloads isresource consuming due to the algorithmic complexity of the outlier mining process. In thiswork we propose a sharing-aware multi-query execution strategy for outlier detection ondata streams called SOP. The key insight of SOP is to transform the problem of handling amulti-query outlier analytics workload into a single-query skyline computation problem. SOPachieves minimal utilization of both computational and memory resources for the processingof these complex outlier analytics workload.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems,2016,2
MaVis: Machine Learning Aided Multi-Model Framework for Time Series Visual Analytics,Kaiyu Zhao; Matthew Ward; Elke Rundensteiner; Huong Higgins,The ultimate goal of any visual analytic task is to make sense of the data and gain insights.Unfortunately; the continuously growing scale of the data nowadays challenges thetraditional data analytics in the “big-data” era. Particularly; the human cognitive capabilitiesare constant whereas the data scale is not. Furthermore; most existing work focus on how toextract interesting information and present that to the user while not emphasizing on how toprovide options to the analysts if the extracted information is not interesting. In this paper; wepropose a visual analytic tool called MaVis that integrates multiple machine learning modelswith a plug-and-play style to describe the input data. It allows the analysts to choose the waythey prefer to summarize the data. The MaVis framework provides multiple linked analyticspaces for interpretation at different levels.

CAQE: A Contract Driven Approach to Processing Concurrent Decision Support Queries.,Venkatesh Raghavan; Elke A Rundensteiner,ABSTRACT Real-time analytical systems need to handle workloads comprised of expensivedecision support queries with diverse quality of service requirements known as contracts.Contract driven multi-query processing; being an NP-hard problem; remains unaddressed todate. The traditional approach of blindly pipelining the entire input through a sharedexecution plan is not viable due to the diversity in query contracts. To tackle this challenge;we now develop a flexible model to express contracts and accompany it with an effectivemeans to measure the run-time contract satisfaction. We propose our Contract-Aware QueryExecution framework CAQE. In this work; we exploit the principle that “different portions ofthe input contribute to disparate subsets of queries with varying degrees ofprogressiveness.” Therefore; CAQE's processing of the input chunks is driven by how the …,EDBT,2014,2
COLARM: Cost-based Optimization for Localized Association Rule Mining.,Abhishek Mukherji; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,ABSTRACT Association rule mining typically focuses on discovering global rules validacross the entire dataset.

Query mesh: An efficient multi-route approach to query optimization,Rimma V Nehme; Karen Works; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—In most database systems; traditional and stream systems alike; the optimizerpicks a single query plan for all data based on the overall statistics of the data. It hashowever been repeatedly observed that real-life datasets are non-uniform. Selecting asingle execution plan may result in a query execution that is ineffective for possibly largeportions of the actual data. In this paper; we present a practical alternative to the currentstate-of-the-art query optimization techniques; termed a multiroute query mesh model (orshort QM). The main idea of QM is to compute multiple routes (query plans); each designedfor a particular subset of data with distinct statistical properties. Based on the executionroutes and the data characteristics; a classifier model is induced. The classifier is used forefficient partitioning of the new data to assign the best route for query processing. We …,*,2008,2
Adapting partitioned continuous query processing in distributed systems,Yali Zhu; Elke A Rundensteiner,Partitioned query processing is an effective method to process continuous queries with largestateful operators in a distributed systems. This method typically partitions input data intonon-overlapping portions; with each query plan instance installed on a separate machineprocessing only one portion of the data. Dynamic redistribution of load among machines isthen employed to handle fluctuating stream characteristics. However; existing loadredistribution solutions have made the implicit assumption that no local query optimization isconducted at runtime on any of the participating machines; ie; all local query plan instancesare static and thus remain identical. This is restrictive for dynamic stream systems; wheredata partitions may experience significant fluctuations in selectivities or arrival rates overtime-thus warranting local plan reoptimization.

HUX: a schemacentric approach for updating XML views,Ling Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani; Ming Jiang,The problem of updating XML views is more complex than in the relational scenario due toits nested hierarchical structure. While several research projects [1; 4] began to explore thisXML view updating problem; they typically provide no guarantee for avoiding view sideeffects. An update translatability analysis can be employed to reason about the potentialview side effects before performing the update. Intuitively; such analysis could examine theactual base data [2; 3]. However; as indicated by [2]; this data-centric search for a translationtends to be very expensive; even for relational view updates. Instead; in our HUX project; wehave designed a comprehensive solution of exploring schema-knowledge to optimize thisanalysis.

Such reduction brings the tradeoff between the number ofmaintenance queries and the complexity of each query. These algorithms have beenimplemented in a working prototype system.

Dyda: A compensation based approach to dynamic data warehouse maintenance,Songting Chen; Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Data warehousing is an emerging technology to support high-level decision makingby gathering data from several distributed data sources into one repository. A DataWarehouse Management System (DWMS) maintains materialized views derived from one ormore data sources under source changes. Given the dynamic nature of modern distributedenvironments; both source data and schema changes are likely to occur autonomously andeven concurrently. Current data warehouse maintenance strategies typically issuemaintenance queries to the data sources and then apply compensating queries to correctany errors in the delta refreshs. However; these existing solutions are limited to handlingdata updates only; making the restricting assumptions that the schemata of all sourcesremain stable over time; and thus maintenance or compensation queries are never …,*,2002,2
Active page generation via customizing xml for data beans in e-commerce applications,Li Chen; Elke Rundensteiner; Afshan Ally; Rice Chen; Weidong Kou,Abstract In this paper; we analyze enabling technologies for typical e-business applicationsin terms of their multi-tier system architecture and their Model-Control-View (MCV)programming model. Based on observed limitations of the JSP (Java Server Page)technique commonly adopted for dynamic page generation (the view logic); we instead pro-pose an alternative solution approach; namely; a generic schema map-ping strategy togenerate XML documents and DTDs from enterprise data beans. First; we describe in detailthe XML generation process for the content composition logic. We also outline the XSLprocessing for the transformation logic. The separation of these two logics results in ageneric solution to the bean viewing problem. In particular; it improves the bean reusabilityvia its XML representative compared to the rigid strategy of hard-coding logics into JSP …,*,2001,2
Gangam: Modeling Transformations for Integrating Now and Tomorrow,Kajal Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Today many application engineers struggle to not only publish their relational;object or ascii file data on the Web but to also integrate information from diverse sources;often inventing and reinventing a suite of hard-wired integration tools. A model managementsystem that supports the specification and manipulation of not only data models andschemata; but also mappings between the different models in a generic manner has thepromise of solving these issues. However; support for modeling and managing suchmappings as objects remains an unsolved challenge. In our work; we propose a powerfulmiddleware tool that successfully tackles this challenge. For this; we propose a graph-theoretic framework that allows users to explicitly model mappings between different datamodels as well as re-structuring within one data model. Our map metamodel is based on …,*,2001,2
Rule inheritance and overriding in active object-oriented databases,Naumann Chaudry; James Moyne; Elke Rundensteiner,The concept of inheritance is among the most important features of object-orienteddatabases (OODBs). The different issues and trade-offs regarding inheritance have beenstudied for a number of years for passive OODBs. However; no general treatment of ruleinheritance and overriding has been undertakenfor active OODBs. Such treatment isconspicuously missing for rules that are defined over multiple classes; even though mostactive OODBs support the definition of such rules. In this chapter; we fill this gap bydeveloping a formal model for rule inheritance and overriding in active OODBs. We identifyimportant features required in an active OODB model; such as support for rule inheritanceand rule overriding; and provision of the notion of syntactic compatibility. We then define aformal model for active rules by adapting the concept of multi-methods for use in defining …,Current trends in data management,1999,2
Aggregation path index for incremental web view maintenance,Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract As web data becomes more essential in our work and play and it keeps growing inan explosive way; web view mechanisms are extensively employed to offer customizedvalue-added services to customers and they are usually materialized to achieve fast queryresponse time. However; the dynamicity problems of the underneath web information is notas easy to tackle as it is in the context of conventional database systems.

Minmax trees: efficient relational operation support for hierarchical data exploration,Ionel D Stroe; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract This paper presents a new method for implementing hierarchical navigationoperations in relational database systems as required for applications such as interactivevisual explorations over large datasets. A particular class of recursive unions of joins anddivisions that operate on hierarchies has been identified. By using adequate pre-computation (ie; organizing the hierarchical structure as what we called a MinMax tree); therecursive processing of the operations in this class is shown to be reducible to rangequeries. Extensions of the method for non-tree as well as dynamic hierarchies have alsobeen designed. We implemented our technique using Oracle 7 and C as a host languageand showed that the MinMax method performed significantly faster than the equivalentrecursive ones. Our method has been applied to implement navigation operations in …,*,1999,2
Visualization and database tools for YAC and cosmid contig construction,SW Thomas; Elke A Rundensteiner; Amy J Lee,Recently; construction of physical maps based on YAC and cosmid contigs has becomeincreasingly common; since these maps serve as a fine-scale ordering basis for genesearches. We describe a combination of visualization and database tools that address thisproblem. The YAC-Cosmid contig tool is a map visualization and editing tool designed forlarge data sets. The Physical Map Assembler (PMA) uses a rule-based interval-orderingapproach to infer ordering from experimental data. It is implemented as an active object-oriented database. The PMA visualizer displays interval orderings in a comprehensiblefashion; and thus helps the scientist resolve conflicts and ambiguities identified by PMA.Both visualization tools let the user query the database to see the details behind the picture.We have found that a tight integration of visualization and analysis tools with the …,System Sciences; 1995.

Benchmarks for Object-Oriented View Mechanisms,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Views are an established technique for virtually restructuring data; classes; and schemata soas to meet the needs of speci c applications or users; for integrating heterogeneous anddistributed systems (for example; data warehouse systems); and for achievinginteroperability by hiding the idiosyncrasies of component systems to be integrated into oneuni ed; yet federated system. Because the restructuring is virtual; applications can use viewsto customize shared data objects; even adding new extrinsic properties and behavior;without a ecting other applications' perceptions of the data. Through view technology; anydatabase object can behave di erently depending on in which view's context it appears.Typically; the contents of a view are derived using the view's stored query; in which caseeach query upon the extent of a view must be translated into a query upon the view's …,Ann Arbor,1995,2
An Active OODB System for Genome Physical Map Assembly,Amy J Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner; Spencer Thomas,Abstract| In this paper; we describe the design and implementation of a scienti c databasefor the map assembly tasks performed by the geneticists at the University of MichiganHuman Genome Center. Our system manages complex genomic data and supports theautomation of the associated map assembly tasks. For this purpose; we have developed anoverlap re nement hierarchy characterizing the types of overlap and ordering relationshipsbetween DNA fragments. Based on this model; we designed an associated set of inferenceoperators to automate some of the contig assembly steps; such as inferring overlapinformation using transitivity rules.

Restricting Is-A Related Groupings Using Object Equivalence.,Elke A Rundensteiner; Lubomir Bic; Jonathan P Gilbert; Meng-Lai Yin,Abstract: Most research on semantic integrity has taken place in the traditional databasefields; specifically; the relational data model. Advanced models; such as; semantic andobject-oriented data models; have developed higher-level abstractions to increase theirexpressive power in order to meet the needs of newly emerging application domains. Thisallows them to incorporate some semantic constraints directly into their schemas. There arehowever many types of restrictions that cannot be expressed solely by these high-levelconstructs. Therefore we extend the potential of advanced models by augmenting theirabstractions with useful set restrictions. In particular; we exploit the notion of object identityfor the definition of a dual model of object equivalence for complex objects constructed bygrouping abstractions. Based on this; we define a number of restrictions that control the …,DASFAA,1991,2

Distributed Local Outlier Detection in Big Data,Yizhou Yan; Lei Cao; Caitlin Kulhman; Elke Rundensteiner,Abstract In this work; we present the first distributed solution for the Local Outlier Factor(LOF) method--a popular outlier detection technique shown to be very effective for datasetswith skewed distributions. As datasets increase radically in size; highly scalable LOFalgorithms leveraging modern distributed infrastructures are required. This poses significantchallenges due to the complexity of the LOF definition; and a lack of access to the entiredataset at any individual compute machine. Our solution features a distributed LOF pipelineframework; called DLOF. Each stage of the LOF computation is conducted in a fullydistributed fashion by leveraging our invariant observation for intermediate valuemanagement. Furthermore; we propose a data assignment strategy which ensures that eachmachine is self-sufficient in all stages of the LOF pipeline; while minimizing the number of …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,1

Context-Aware Event Stream Analytics.,Olga Poppe; Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Daniel J Dougherty,ABSTRACT Complex event processing is a popular technology for continuously monitoringhigh-volume event streams from health care to traffic management to detect complexcompositions of events. These event compositions signify critical “application contexts” fromhygiene violations to traffic accidents. Certain event queries are only appropriate inparticular contexts. Yet state-of-the-art streaming engines tend to execute all event queriescontinuously regardless of the current application context.

Practical identification of dynamic precedence criteria to produce critical results from big data streams,Karen Works; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract During periods of high volume; big data stream applications may not have enoughresources to process all incoming tuples. To maximize the production of the most criticalresults under such resource shortages; a recent solution; PR (short for Preferential Result);utilizes both static criteria (defined at compile-time) and dynamic criteria (identified online atrun-time) to prioritize the processing of tuples throughout the query pipeline. Unfortunately;locating the optimal criteria placement (ie; where in the query pipeline to evaluate eachprioritization criteria) is extremely compute-intensive and runs in exponential time. Thismakes PR impractical for complex big data stream systems. Our proposed criteria selectionand placement approach; PR-Prune (short for Preferential Result-Pruning); is practical.

In a recent paper; we presented a novel pointwise local pattern explorationsystem for visual sensitivity analysis. Using this system; analysts are able to explore localpatterns and the sensitivity at individual data points; which reveals the relationships betweena focal point and its neighbors.

Achieving high freshness and optimal throughput in CPU-limited execution of multi-join continuous queries,Abhishek Mukherji; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract Due to high data volumes and unpredictable arrival rates; continuous querysystems processing expensive queries in real-time may fail to keep up with the input datastreams-resulting in buffer overflow and uncontrolled data loss. We explore join directionadaptation (JDA) to tackle CPU-limited processing of multi-join stream queries. The existingJDA solutions allocate the scarce CPU resources to the most productive half-way join withina single operator. We instead leverage the operator interdependencies to optimize theoverall query throughput. We identify result staleness; typically ignored by most state-of-the-art techniques; as a critical issue in CPU-limited processing. It gets further aggravated ifthroughput optimizing techniques are employed. We establish the novel path-productivitymodel and the Freshness predicate.

Re-WEB: Re-Usable Templates for Web View Generation and Restructuring,Kajal T Claypool; Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In our emerging digital paper-less society; diverse web site representations of on-line repositories must be served over the internet to di erent user groups. Our database-centric approach called Re-WEB addresses this need for exible web site generation;restructuring; and maintenance by associating web semantics with the modeling constructsof the ODMG object model.

Evaluating View Materialization Strategies for Complex Hierarchical Objects,Matthew C Jones; Elke A Rundensteiner,In many design applications; it is common practice to store complex hierarchical objects in acompact folded form to save storage space and to reduce processing costs for accessing theobjects. In these folded representations; complex objects are built up from identical andotherwise indistinguishable design objects. However; it is often necessary; especially duringthe refinement of data; to distinguish between these identical folded objects by personalizinga subset of them. The established practice is to explicitly unfold the hierarchical objects andthus create space in which to store distinct personalization data for each object occurrence.However; this explicit unfolding is costly and time consuming; resulting in a potentially muchlarger structure; and substantially increasing the costs of querying and updating the design.Therefore; we propose an unfold view operator and provide the basis for updating of …,*,1997,1
Extended Aggregation Relationships for Process Specification and Enactment in Active Databases,Nauman Chaudhry; James Moyne; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract: Process specification in a variety of domains; such as experiment modeling; work-flow modeling; and processflows in semiconductor manufacturing; is typically characterizedby recursive specification in terms of sequences and alternatives. A variety of models havebeen proposed for the specification of such processes. In particular; object-orientedtechniques have been used for achieving various desirable features (eg; reusability;maintainability; etc.) in the process specification and active databases have been suggestedas possible platforms for process enactment. However; on the one hand object-orientedmodels for process specification lack an important feature of object-orientation; namely theability to organize processes as classes with inheritance support; and on the other handvarious problems; such as lack of methodological support for active rule definition …,*,1996,1

Nested complex event processing: predicate specification and evaluation,Dazhi Zhang; M Ray; M Liu; D Dougherty; EA Rundensteiner,Abstract. Complex event processing (CEP) is increasingly becoming a paradigm of choice inmodern applications; ranging from supply chain management for RFID tracking to real-timeintrusion detection. To support all requirements of such monitoring applications; one must beable to specify and process complex event patterns over streams including nested event non-existence and predicate correlation. State-of-the-art solutions for CEP such as SASE;ZStream or Cayuga either do not support the specification of nesting of such complex patternqueries or they limit the nesting of non-occurrence expressions to be simple event types. Arecent work by Liu et al proposed a nested complex event pattern expression language;called Nested Complex Event Language (NEEL); that supports the specification of the non-occurrence over complex expressions. However; there exist challenges related to …,Transactions on Large-Scale Data-and Knowledge-Centered Systems V,*,1
Automatic emotion detection in text streams by analyzing Twitter data,Maryam Hasan; Elke Rundensteiner; Emmanuel Agu,Abstract Techniques to detect the emotions expressed in microblogs and social media postshave a wide range of applications including; detecting psychological disorders such asanxiety or depression in individuals or measuring the public mood of a community. A majorchallenge for automated emotion detection is that emotions are subjective concepts withfuzzy boundaries and with variations in expression and perception. To address this issue; adimensional model of affect is utilized to define emotion classes. Further; a soft classificationapproach is proposed to measure the probability of assigning a message to each emotionclass. We develop and evaluate a supervised learning system to automatically classifyemotion in text stream messages. Our approach includes two main tasks: an offline trainingtask and an online classification task.

Scalable Top-n Local Outlier Detection,Yizhou Yan; Lei Cao; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method that labels all points with their respective LOFscores to indicate their status is known to be very effective for identifying outliers in datasetswith a skewed distribution. Since outliers by definition are the absolute minority in a dataset;the concept of Top-N local outlier was proposed to discover the n points with the largest LOFscores. The detection of the Top-N local outliers is prohibitively expensive; since it requireshuge number of high complexity k-nearest neighbor (kNN) searches. In this work; wepresent the first scalable Top-N local outlier detection approach called TOLF. The keyinnovation of TOLF is a multi-granularity pruning strategy that quickly prunes most pointsfrom the set of potential outlier candidates without computing their exact LOF scores or evenwithout conducting any kNN search for them.

GRETA: graph-based real-time event trend aggregation,Olga Poppe; Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; David Maier,Abstract Streaming applications from algorithmic trading to traffic management deployKleene patterns to detect and aggregate arbitrarily-long event sequences; called eventtrends. State-of-theart systems process such queries in two steps. Namely; they firstconstruct all trends and then aggregate them. Due to the exponential costs of trendconstruction; this two-step approach suffers from both a long delays and high memory costs.To overcome these limitations; we propose the Graph-based Real-time Event TrendAggregation (GRETA) approach that dynamically computes event trend aggregation withoutfirst constructing these trends.

In this paper; we describe a set of historyviews to fill this gap. This technique works under two modes: merge and non-merge. For themerge mode; merge algorithms were applied to selected time windows to generate achange-based hierarchy. Contiguous time windows having similar patterns are merged first.Users can choose different levels of merging with the tradeoff between more details in thedata and less visual clutter in the visualizations.

Achieving High Output Utility under Limited Resources through Structure-based Shedding and Spilling in XML Streams,Mingzhu Wei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract Because of high volumes and unpredictable arrival rates; stream processingsystems are not always able to keep up with input data streams—resulting in buffer overflowand uncontrolled loss of data. Load shedding and spilling are two core techniques proposedto solve this overflow problem. While load shedding simply discards data; load spillingtemporarily pushes the data to disk for later reuse. Note that shedding and spilling applied toXML stream processing bring new challenges due to complex nested nature of XMLstructures. In this dissertation; we tackle structurebased shedding and spilling for XMLstreams to maximally meet the needs of the users. Our goal is to generate as manyhighquality results as possible. We first tackle the problem of generating “correct results”. Weinvestigate how to generate correct runtime output which is the common problem for …,*,2009,*
Skyline and Mapping Aware Query Evaluation Across Disparate Data Sources,Venkatesh Raghavan; Shweta Srivastava; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Growing interests in multi-criteria decision support applications have resulted in aflurry of efficient skyline algorithms. In practice; real-world decision support applicationsrequire to access data from disparate sources. Existing techniques define the skylineoperation to work on a single set; and therefore; treat skylines as an “add-on" on top of atraditional Select-Project-Join query plan. In many real world applications; the skylinedimensions can be anticorrelated (eg; attribute pairs {price; mileage} for cars or {price;distance} for hotels). Anti-correlated data are skyline-unfriendly and thus ignored by existingtechniques. In this work; we propose a robust execution framework called SKIN to evaluateskyline over joins. The salient features of SKIN are:(a) effective in reducing the two primarycosts; namely the cost of generating the join results and the cost of dominance …,*,2009,*
Tagging Stream Data for Rich RealTime,Rimma Nehme; Elke Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In recent years; data streams have become ubiquitous as technology is improvingand the prices of portable devices are falling; eg; sensor networks; location-based services.Most data streams transmit only data tuples based on which continuous queries areevaluated. In this paper; we propose to enrich data streams with a new type of metadatacalled streaming tags or short tick-tags1. The fundamental premise of tagging is that userscan label data using uncontrolled vocabulary; and these tags can be exploited in a widevariety of applications; such as data exploration; data search; and to produce “enriched” withadditional semantics; thus more informative query results. In this paper we focus primarily onthe problem of continuous query processing with streaming tags and tagged objects; andaddress the tick-tag semantic issues as well as efficiency concerns.

QoS: Quality Driven Data Abstraction Generation For Large Databases.,Charudatta V Wad; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,ABSTRACT Data abstraction is the process of reducing a large dataset into one of moderatesize; while maintaining dominant characteristics of the original dataset. Data abstractionquality refers to the degree to which the abstraction represents the original data. The qualityof an abstraction directly affects the confidence an analyst can have in results derived fromsuch abstracted views about the actual data. Some initial measures to quantify the quality ofabstraction have been proposed; however; they currently can only be utilized as an after-thought. An analyst can be made aware of the quality of the data he works with; but hecannot control the quality he desires and the trade-off between the time required to generatethe abstraction and its quality. While some analysts require at least a certain minimal level ofquality; others must be able to work with certain abstraction quality due to time and …,QDB,2007,*

Balancing Memory Load in D-CAPE Using Replication-Style Distributed Partitioning of Operator States,Bradley A Momberger; Elke A Rundensteiner; Michael A Gennert,Abstract Distributed continuous stream query systems have been shown to meet the needsof a range of high-volume applications. However; in some applications the stream queriesfor these applications may require a wide range of sizes of allocated memory. In such casesit may not be feasible to continue to store the data for any of the largest operators on a singlemachine. In addition; for the benefit of the users of such a system; we would like to offer asmuch flexibility in query processing as possible. This includes making full use of resourceson the network; even with a highly fluctuating volume and distribution of data. This thesisproposal discusses an unexplored method of partitioning a query operator across severalmachines; without predetermining a destination for each new input for the operator.

Updating XML Views: The Clean Source Theory,Ling Wang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Murali Mani,Abstract XML has become a primary data model to wrap heterogeneous data sources usingviews. However; as is commonly known; views and thus also such XML views suffer from theview update problem. In this paper; we characterize the search space of all potential correctupdate mappings in the context of the source data also being XML. This is achieved byproposing the notion of a source and of a clean source for a given XML view element.Further; we introduce the clean source theory to determine whether a given view updatemapping is correct. This now serves as a solid theoretical foundation for developing practicalalgorithms towards update translatability checking. We also provide a concrete case studythat applies this theory to assess the translatability of XML view updates with different updatetypes.,*,2005,*

Adaptive QoS-Driven Scheduling Framework for a Continuous Query System,Timothy M Sutherland; Bradford Pielech; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract In a continuous query environment; different applications may have distinct Qualityof Service (QoS) requirements. Given the unpredictability of streaming data; utilizing a singlescheduling algorithm; as done by current state-of-the-art stream query engines; is no longersufficient. Current scheduling algorithms used in these systems are typically one-dimensional; limiting the ability to perform well under changing system conditions. Wepropose a novel algorithm selection framework used in our CAPE system. This frameworkleverages the strengths of current scheduling algorithms to meet sets of QoS requirements.In CAPE; each algorithm can be compared in terms of its past ability to improve the QoS;knowing nothing about the characteristics of the algorithm.

of Schema-Restructuring Views”,Andreas Koeller; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract. An important issue in data integration is the integration of semantically equivalentbut schematically heterogeneous data sources. Declarative mechanisms supportingpowerful source restructuring for such databases have been proposed in the literature; suchas the SQL extension SchemaSQL. However; the issue of incremental maintenance of viewsdefined in such languages remains an open problem. We present an incremental viewmaintenance algorithm for schema-restructuring views. Our algorithm transforms a sourceupdate into an incremental view update; by propagating updates through the operators of aSchemaSQL algebra tree. We observe that schema-restructuring view maintenance requirestransformation of data into schema changes and vice versa.

Detection and Correction of Conflicting Source Updates for Materialized View Maintenance,Songting Chen; Jun Chen; Xin Zhang; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Materialized views; often derived from several data sources; must be maintainedunder source changes. In a distributed context; autonomous source updates can beconcurrent and thus cause erroneous maintenance results. State-of-the-art maintenancestrategies issue maintenance queries to the sources and apply compensating queries tocorrect such errors. However; these solutions are limited to handling data updates only;making the restricting and impractical assumption that all source schemata remain stableover time; and thus neither maintenance nor compensation queries are broken by sourcechanges. In this paper; we propose a general solution that handles both concurrent data andschema changes. First; we analyze the concurrency between source updates and classifythem into di erent classes of dependencies. We then propose Dyno; a two-pronged …,*,2003,*

Proprietary manual translation ofXML documents is not only laborious but also error-prone for the quickly evolving E-Servicesworld. We propose an approach automatically identifies most likely matching choicesbetween the schemas and then generates the corresponding XSLT script to perform theappropriate data transformation. For this; we introduce a set of transformation operations onXML's hierarchical structure. Our system will set up the semantic relationship between twoschemas by discovering the operations that transform the source schema to the target one.We report the experimental studies on real DTDs.,*,2001,*

Consistent Schema Version Removal: An Optimization Technique for Object-Oriented Views,Viviane M Crestana; Amy J Lee; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Powerful solutions enabling interoperability must allow applications to evolve andrequirements of shared databases to change; while minimizing such changes on otherintegrated applications. Several approaches; such as the transparent schema evolutionsystem (TSE) by Ra et al.; schema versions by Lautemann; and integrated views by Bertino;have been proposed to make interoperability possible by using object-oriented techniques.These approaches may generate a large number of schema versions over time resulting inan excessive build-up of classes and underlying object instances; not all being necessarilystill in use. This results in degradation of system performance due to the view maintenanceand the storage overhead costs. In this paper; we address the problem of removing obsoleteview schemas.

MinMax Trees: E cient Relational Operation Support for Hierarchical Data Exploration,Ionel D Stroe; Elke A Rundensteiner; Matthew O Ward,Abstract This paper presents a new method for implementing hierarchical navigationoperations in relational database systems as required for applications such as interactivevisual explorations over large datasets. A particular class of recursive unions of joins anddivisions that operate on hierarchies has been identi ed. By using adequate pre-computation (ie; organizing the hierarchical structure as what we called a MinMax tree); therecursive processing of the operations in this class is shown to be reducible to rangequeries. Extensions of the method for non-tree as well as for dynamic hierarchies have alsobeen designed. We implemented our technique using Oracle 7 and C as a host languageand showed that the MinMax method performed signi cantly faster than the equivalentrecursive ones.

Optimizatizing the Performance of Schema Evolution Sequences,Kajal T Claypool; Chandrakant Natarajan; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract More than ever before schema transformation is a prevalent problem that needs tobe addressed to accomplish for example the migration of legacy systems to the newerOODB systems; the generation of structured web pages from data in database systems; orthe integration of systems with different native data models. Such schema transformationsare typically composed of a sequence of schema evolution operations. The execution ofsuch sequences can be very timeintensive; possibly requiring many hours or even days andthus effectively making the database unavailable for unacceptable time spans. Whileresearchers have looked at the deferred execution approach for schema evolution in aneffort to improve availability of the system; to the best of our knowledge ours is the first effortto provide a direct optimization strategy for a sequence of changes.

An Ounce of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure: Formal Verification for Consistent Database Evolution,Kajal Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Consistency of a database is an important property that must be preserved at alltimes. In most OODB systems today; application code can directly access and alter both thedata as well as the structure of the database. As a consequence application code canpotentially violate the integrity of the database; in terms of the invariants of the data model;the user-specified application constraints; and even the referential integrity of the objectsthemselves. A common form of consistency management in most databases today is toencode constraints at the system level (eg; foreign keys); or at the trigger based level (eg;user constraints) and to perform transaction rollback on discovery of any violation of theseconstraints. However; for programs that alter the structure as well as the objects in adatabase; such as an extensible schema evolution program; roll-backs are expensive …,*,1999,*

Incremental Maintenance of Materialized Path Query OODB Views.,Harumi A Kuno; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Materialized database views allow applications to bene t from the powerful exibilityof views while minimizing the performance penalties traditionally associated with views.However; the need to maintain materialized views in the face of updates limits the variety ofqueries that can be used to de ne them. In this paper we address the problem ofincrementally maintaining OODB views formed using path queries. The indexing needs ofthe path query view problem are unique in that because the contents of the materializedview are cached and can be queried directly; the primary use for a supplemental index isduring the propagation of updates rather than during query processing. Furthermore;traditional index organizations do not distinguish between single-valued and multivaluedattributes; and thus do not account for the fact that multi-valued attributes enable a single …,CODAS,1996,*

Different approaches towards fuzzy database systems A Survey,Elke A Rundensteiner; Lois Wright Hawkes,ABSTRACT Fuzzy data is a phenomenon often occurring in real life. There is the inherentvagueness of classification terms referring to a continuous scale; the uncertainty of linguisticterms such as “l almost agree” or the vagueness of terms and concepts due to the statisticalvariability in communication [20] and many more. Previously; such fuzzy data wasapproximated by non-fuzzy (crisp) data; which obviously did not lead to a correct andprecise representation of the real world. Fuzzy set theory has been developed to representand manipulate fuzzy data [18]. Explicitly managing the degree of fuzziness in databasesallows the system to distinguish between what is known; what is not known and what ispartially known.

Exploring Data Mining Research in Nanotechnology,Aparna S Varde; Jianyu Liang; Elke A Rundensteiner; Richard D Sisson Jr,Abstract Scientific datasets often consist of complex data types such as images. Mining suchdata presents interesting issues related to semantics. In this paper; we explore the researchissues in mining data from the field of nanotechnology. More specifically; we focus on aproblem that relates to image comparison of material nanostructures. A significant challengehere relates to the notion of similarity between the images. Features such as size and heightof nano-particles and inter-particle distance are important in image similarity as conveyed bydomain experts. However; there are no precise notions of similarity defined apriori. Hencethere is a need for learning similarity measures. In this paper; we describe our proposedapproach to learn similarity measures for graphical data. We discuss this with reference tonanostructure images. Other challenges in image comparison are also outlined. The use …,*,*,*
Visual Discovery of Patterns in Census Data,Zaixian Xie; Charudatta Wad; Qingguang Cui Do Quyen Nguyen; Matthew O Ward; Elke A Rundensteiner,One of the biggest challenges when analyzing census data is that many; if not most; of thedata attributes are nominal; rather than ordinal. As most graphical mappings in visualizationassume numbers are controlling the graphical attributes; and that users assume that similargraphical attributes imply similar data attributes; the mapping of nominal variables tonumbers is critical. The above mentioned problem gets much worse when the number ofpossible values a nominal variable can take on is large. Our solution involves structuringand interactively modifying the nominal variables of this dataset that are most critical for thecontest tasks. We use interactive selection; filtering; and reordering to enable users toquickly and easily move through the dimensions associated with ethnicity and languages;using a geospatial layout in conjunction with multivariate glyphs; where instead of …,*,*,*
Event Sequence Detection over Interval-Based Event Streams,Salah Ahmed; Olga Poppe; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract—Event stream applications from stock trend analytics to infection spread preventionmust extract event sequence dependencies from event streams composed of interval-basedevents such as stock trades; records of shipments in storage; etc. The task of finding allpossible sequences; which corresponds to Kleene closure; is not only NP Hard in CPU time;but also profoundly plagued by exponential memory usage. To tackle this challenge; weencode the incoming event stream as a directed acyclic graph called Compact Event Streamgraph (CEStream or CES graph); the nodes of which are intervals denoting the events andthe edges represent the non-overlapping relationships among the event-intervals. TheCEStream data is captured in an interval tree data structure; called the CEStream index; tosupport efficient interval driven lookup. We analyze the stateof-the-art algorithms that …,*,*,*

DESIGN VIEWS FOR SYNTHESIS,Elke A Rundensteiner,Synthesis is a complex task spanning many levels of abstractions and information domains.Hence; CAD systems utilize a global design database to achieve the much needed integrationof this diverse design information into one central data model. Such a central database representsa serious bottleneck for the CAD system. First; it prevents the extensibility of the CAD systemover time; since a change of the global data model requires an (often prohibitivelyexpensive) modification of all current design tools using the database. Second; it forces all designtools to work on the same (comprehensive and hence extremely complex) data model. In thispaper; we introduce a solution to this problem. We propose to utilize the object-oriented viewmethodology; called MultiView; for specifying customized tool interfaces (design views) on theCAD database.

Evolvable View Environment (EV E): Non-Equivalent View Maintenance under Schema Changes,EA Rundensteiner; A Koeller; X Zhang; AJ Lee; A Nica,WWW-based information services such as electronic commerce; digital libraries; and datamining typically gather data from a large number of interconnected Information Sources(ISs).

Privacy-Preserving Complex Event Processing via Event Stream Suppression,Di Wang; Yeye He; Elke A Rundensteiner; Jefferey F Naughton,Abstract—Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a technology for monitoringevent streams in search of user specified event patterns. Extensive research efforts havebeen devoted towards efficient pattern detection in CEP. Its privacy implications; however;have largely been overlooked. In this paper we propose solutions to tackle the problem ofprivacy-preserving CEP (termed PP-CEP). We first introduce a taxonomy of possible variantsof the PP-CEP problem and analyze their computational hardness. We then design a suite ofreal-time PP-CEP solutions that eliminate private pattern matches while maximizing utility.Our first solution; at event-type granularity; is based on solving a linear program. The secondsolution is at event-instance granularity and further optimizes the event-type level solution byexploiting runtime event distributions using advanced pattern match cardinality estimation …,*,*,*

W RCESTER PL TECH IC I STITUTE,Maged El-Sayed; Elke A Rundensteiner; Carolina Ruiz,Abstract Mining frequent patterns is an important component of many prediction systems.One common usage in web applications is the mining of users' access behavior for thepurpose of predicting and hence pre-fetching appropriate web pages. Mining solutions inthe literature are often based on the use of an Apriori-like candidate generation strategy;which typically requires numerous scans of the potentially huge sequence database. In thispaper we instead introduce a more efficient strategy for discovering frequent patterns insequence databases that requires only two scans of the database. The first scan obtainssupport counts for subsequences of length two. The second scan extracts potentiallyfrequent sequences of any length and represents them as a compressed pattern treestructure (FS-tree). Frequent sequence patterns are then mined from the FS-tree …,*,*,*
APIX: An E cient Approach to Maintain Web Views,Li Chen; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Due to the increase of web data; web view mechanisms are extensively employedto serve customized data views to users.

To compute web view\patches" for incremental maintenance; a largenumber of accesses back to base data is usually inevitable.

WPI-CS-TR-99-21 August 1999,Kajal T Claypool; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Consistency of a database is as an important property that must be preserved at alltimes. In most OODB systems today; application code can directly access and alter both thedata as well as the structure of the database. As a consequence application code canpotentially violate the integrity of the database; in terms of the invariants of the data model;the user-specified application constraints; and even the referential integrity of the objectsthemselves. A common form of consistency management in most databases today is toencode constraints at the system level (eg; foreign keys); or at the trigger based level (eg;user constraints) and to perform transaction rollback on discovery of any violation of theseconstraints. However; for programs that alter the structure as well as the objects in adatabase; such as an extensible schema evolution program; roll-backs are expensive …,*,*,*

Evaluating Sliding Window Joins over Continuous Punctuated Streams,Luping Ding; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Processing joins over continuous data streams faces the problem of maintaininglarge and possibly even unbounded state. Constraints can help join operators to purge no-longer-useful data from the runtime state. While prior work only exploits a single type ofconstraints; we propose a join algorithm named PWJoin that effectively exploits both slidingwindow (regarding time) and punctuation (regarding data value) constraints. We alsoexplore optimizations enabled by the interactions of these two constraint types. The solutionis general; handling n-way joins (n≥ 2) with different window types. Our experimental studyshows that in most cases; PWJoin outperforms existing join solutions that utilize a singleconstraint type.,*,*,*

B+ Retake: Sustaining High Volume Inserts into Large Data,Kurt W Deschler; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract Modern ad− hoc data mining queries often run on databases over a terabyte in size.At this scale; large data pages are required to obtain sufficient disk performance.Unfortunately; these large data pages greatly increase update costs; especially for packedstructures such as the B+ tree. In a frequently updated warehouse; users are often forced todecide between query performance and update performance in order to meet maintenancetime windows. Solutions that provide both are welcome. In this paper; we analyze andmeasure the memory related costs of B+ Tree updates with large data pages. We introducethe RB+(Red− Black+) tree as a practical replacement for the B+ tree. The RB+ tree usespersistent red− black binary trees instead of sorted records for leaf pages. This organizationimproves memory performance up to 3;000% for updates and provides query …,*,*,*

Minimization of Joins in XML-to-SQL Translation: An Algebraic Approach,Murali Mani Song Wang Dan Dougherty; Elke Rundensteiner,ABSTRACT Consider an XML view defined over a relational database; and a user queryspecified over this view. This user XML query is typically processed using the followingsteps:(a) our translator maps the XML query to one or more SQL queries;(b) relationalengine translates an SQL query to a relational algebra plan;(c) relational engine executesthe algebra plan and returns SQL results; and (d) our translator translates the SQL resultsback to XML. However; a straightforward XML query→ SQL query→ relational algebra planproduces a plan that is inefficient and has redundant joins. In this paper; we report on ourpreliminary studies with respect to how joins in such a relational algebra plan can beminimized. We use an algebraic approach that preserves the SQL's bag semantics; asopposed to the previous join minimization studies that assume a set-based semantics …,*,*,*
Security and Privacy in Data Stream Management Systems,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Privacy and security in the context of the streaming systems largely have beenoverlooked. We now tackle this important problem in this paper. Our work focuses oncontextaware security and user-centric privacy preservation in data stream managementsystems (DSMS) by exploiting security constraints (called security punctuations) that aredynamically embedded into data streams. The novelty of our proposed approach is thataccess control policies are not persistently stored in the DSMS but rather streamed togetherwith the data. We present novel query operators; termed Security Shield (SS) and Security-Compliant Join (SCJoin) that are designed to make queries comply with the security policiesof the streaming data while still guaranteeing near real-time response. As a proof offeasibility; we have implemented the security punctuation framework within a real DSMS …,*,*,*
