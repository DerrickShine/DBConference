View selection in semantic web databases,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract We consider the setting of a Semantic Web database; containing both explicit dataencoded in RDF triples; and implicit data; implied by the RDF semantics. Based on a queryworkload; we address the problem of selecting a set of views to be materialized in thedatabase; minimizing a combination of query processing; view storage; and viewmaintenance costs. Starting from an existing relational view selection method; we devisenew algorithms for recommending view sets; and show that they scale significantly beyondthe existing relational ones when adapted to the RDF context. To account for implicit triplesin query answers; we propose a novel RDF query reformulation algorithm and an innovativeway of incorporating it into view selection in order to avoid a combinatorial explosion in thecomplexity of the selection process. The interest of our techniques is demonstrated …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,88
Growing triples on trees: an XML-RDF hybrid model for annotated documents,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Abstract Since the beginning of the Semantic Web initiative; significant efforts have beeninvested in finding efficient ways to publish; store; and query metadata on the Web. RDF andSPARQL have become the standard data model and query language; respectively; todescribe resources on the Web. Large amounts of RDF data are now available either asstand-alone datasets or as metadata over semi-structured (typically XML) documents. Theability to apply RDF annotations over XML data emphasizes the need to represent andquery data and metadata simultaneously. We propose XR; a novel hybrid data modelcapturing the structural aspects of XML data and the semantics of RDF; also enabling us toreason about XML data. Our model is general enough to describe pure XML or RDFdatasets; as well as RDF-annotated XML data; where any XML node can act as a …,The VLDB Journal,2013,20
RDFViewS: a storage tuning wizard for RDF applications,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract In recent years; the significant growth of RDF data used in numerous applicationshas made its efficient and scalable manipulation an important issue. In this paper; wepresent RDFViewS; a system capable of choosing the most suitable views to materialize; inorder to minimize the query response time for a specific SPARQL query workload; whiletaking into account the view maintenance cost and storage space constraints. Our systememploys practical algorithms and heuristics to navigate through the search space ofpotential view configurations; and exploits the possibly available semantic information-expressed via an RDF Schema-to ensure the completeness of the query evaluation.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,15
Querying with access patterns and integrity constraints,Michael Benedikt; Julien Leblay; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract Traditional query processing involves a search for plans formed by applyingalgebraic operators on top of primitives representing access to relations in the input query.But many querying scenarios involve two interacting issues that complicate the search. Onthe one hand; the search space may be limited by access restrictions associated with theinterfaces to datasources; which require certain parameters to be given as inputs. On theother hand; the search space may be extended through the presence of integrity constraintsthat relate sources to each other; allowing for plans that do not match the structure of theuser query. In this paper we present the first optimization approach that attacks both thesedifficulties within a single framework; presenting a system in which classical cost-based joinoptimization is extended to support both access-restrictions and constraints. Instead of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,14
Fact checking and analyzing the web,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Abstract Fact checking and data journalism are currently strong trends. The sheer amount ofdata at hand makes it difficult even for trained professionals to spot biased; outdated orsimply incorrect information. We propose to demonstrate FactMinder; a fact checking andanalysis assistance application. SIGMOD attendees will be able to analyze documents usingFactMinder and experience how background knowledge and open data repositories helpbuild insightful overviews of current topics.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,14
Generating plans from proofs: the interpolation-based approach to query reformulation,Michael Benedikt; Julien Leblay; Balder ten Cate; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract Query reformulation refers to a process of translating a source query—a request forinformation in some high-level logic-based language—into a target plan that abides bycertain interface restrictions. Many practical problems in data management can be seen asinstances of the reformulation problem. For example; the problem of translating an SQLquery written over a set of base tables into another query written over a set of views; theproblem of implementing a query via translating to a program calling a set of database APIs;the problem of implementing a query using a collection of web services. In this book weapproach query reformulation in a very general setting that encompasses all the problemsabove; by relating it to a line of research within mathematical logic. For many decadeslogicians have looked at the problem of converting" implicit definitions" into" explicit …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2016,10
Materialized view-based processing of RDF queries,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,The increasing interest in the RDF data model has turned the efficient processing of queriesover RDF datasets to a challenging and crucial task. Indeed; the triple format of the RDFdata model; along with the lack of structure that characterizes it; raise new challenges indata management both in terms of performance and scalability. In this paper; we considerimproving the performance of RDF query evaluation by using materialized views. Startingfrom a workload of queries; we describe the space of possible views to materialize; weintroduce ways for assessing the optimality of each view set and we propose practicalalgorithms for exploring the search space. When an RDF Schema is available; our algorithmtakes advantage of it to guarantee the completeness of answering queries. We evaluate theefficiency of our search algorithms and demonstrate the benefits of the materialized views …,Bases de Données Avancées,2010,7
PDQ: Proof-driven query answering over web-based data,Michael Benedikt; Julien Leblay; Efthymia Tsamoura,Abstract The data needed to answer queries is often available through Web-based APIs.Indeed; for a given query there may be many Web-based sources which can be used toanswer it; with the sources overlapping in their vocabularies; and differing in their accessrestrictions (required arguments) and cost. We introduce PDQ (Proof-Driven QueryAnswering); a system for determining a query plan in the presence of web-based sources. Itis:(i) constraint-aware--exploiting relationships between sources to rewrite an expensivequery into a cheaper one;(ii) access-aware--abiding by any access restrictions known in thesources; and (iii) cost-aware--making use of any cost information that is available aboutservices. PDQ takes the novel approach of generating query plans from proofs that a queryis answerable. We demonstrate the use of PDQ and its effectiveness in generating low …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,4
SPARQL query answering with bitmap indexes,Julien Leblay,Abstract When querying RDF data; one may use reasoning to reach intensional data; ie;data defined by sets of rules. This is usually achieved through forward chaining; with spaceand maintenance overheads; or backward chaining; with high query evaluation andoptimization costs. Recent approaches rely on pre-computing the terminological closure ofthe data rather than the full saturation. In this setting; one can even query the data withoutresorting to backward chaining; using a so-called semantic index. However; thesetechniques are limited in the type of queries they can support. In this paper; we introduce adata storage technique which mitigates the space issues of forward-chaining. We show thatit can also be used with a semantic index. We propose a new structure for the index thatrelies on bitmaps making it resilient to updates. Our experimental results demonstrate that …,Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Web Information Management,2012,4
Des triplets sur des arbres: un modele hybride XML-RDF pour documents annotés,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Une énergie considérable est consacrée à l'enrichissement sémantique de données XMLdu web via des annotations. Celles-ci vont de simples métadonnées jusqu'à des relationssémantiques complexes entre données. Bien que l'idée d'utiliser des annotations soit deplus en plus largement partagée; il reste à définir l'architecture qui permettra de la mettre enœuvre. Dans cet but; nous présentons un framework permettant le stockage et l'interrogationde documents annotés. Nous introduisons (i) le modèle de données XR; dans lequel lesdocuments annotés sont des documents XML décrits sémantiquement par des triplets RDF;et (ii) le langage de requêtes XRQ permettant d'interroger les documents annotés par leurstructure et leur sémantique.

A Declarative Approach to Data-Driven Fact Checking.,Julien Leblay,Abstract Fact checking is an essential part of any investigative work. For linguistic;psychological and social reasons; it is an inherently human task. Yet; modern media make itincreasingly difficult for experts to keep up with the pace at which information is produced.Hence; we believe there is value in tools to assist them in this process. Much of the effort onWeb data research has been focused on coping with incompleteness and uncertainty.Comparatively; dealing with context has received less attention; although it is crucial injudging the validity of a claim. For instance; what holds true in a US state; might not in itsneighbors; eg; due to obsolete or superseded laws. In this work; we address the problem ofchecking the validity of claims in multiple contexts. We define a language to represent andquery facts across different dimensions. The approach is non-intrusive and allows …,AAAI,2017,3
Exploring the Veracity of Online Claims with BackDrop,Julien Leblay; Weiling Chen; Steven Lynden,Abstract Using the Web to assess the validity of claims presents many challenges. Whetherthe data comes from social networks or established media outlets; individual or institutionaldata publishers; one has to deal with scale and heterogeneity; as well as with incomplete;imprecise and sometimes outright false information. All of these are closely studied issues.Yet in many situations; the claims under scrutiny; and the data itself; have some inherentcontext-dependency making them impossible to completely disprove; or evaluate through asimple (eg scalar) measure. While data models used on the Web typically deal withuniversal knowledge; we believe the time has come to put context; such as time orprovenance; at the forefront and watch knowledge through multiple lenses. We presentBackDrop; an application that enables annotating knowledge and ontologies found …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Extended query language and composition for the XR data model,Alin Deutsch; François Goasdoué; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,The XR data model allows capturing rich semistructured corpora of documents (XML) withannotations (RDF triples). A simple query language for XR was presented in previous work;which allowed to retrieve results from from XR databases but not to build new XR content.This work makes two contributions. First; we present an extension of the query languagegiving powerful content structuring and grouping capabilities which enables flexiblegeneration of new XR results. Second; we provide a query-view composition algorithmwhich enables the efficient evaluation of XR queries over previously defined XR views.,*,2013,*
