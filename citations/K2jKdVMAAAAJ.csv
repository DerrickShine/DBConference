Visual query systems for databases: A survey,Tiziana Catarci; Maria F Costabile; Stefano Levialdi; Carlo Batini,Abstract Visual query systems (VQSs) are query systems for databases that use visualrepresentations to depict the domain of interest and express related requests. VQSs can beseen as an evolution of query languages adopted into database management systems; theyare designed to improve the effectiveness of the human–computer communication. Thus;their most important features are those that determine the nature of the human–computerdialogue. In order to survey and compare existing VQSs used for querying traditionaldatabases; we first introduce a classification based on such features; namely the adoptedvisual representations and the interaction strategies. We then identify several user types andmatch the VQS classes against them; in order to understand which kind of system may besuitable for each kind of user. We also report usability experiments which support our …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,1997,404
Representing and using interschema knowledge in cooperative information systems,Tiziana Catarci; Maurizio Lenzerini,Managing interschema knowledge is an essential task when dealing with cooperativeinformation systems. We propose a logical approach to the problem of both expressinginterschema knowledge; and reasoning about it. In particular; we set up a structuredrepresentation language for expressing semantic interdependencies between classesbelonging to different database schemas; and present a method for reasoning over such.interdependencies. The language and the associated reasoning technique makes itpossible to build a logic-based module that can draw useful inferences whenever the needarises of both comparing and combining the knowledge represented in the variousschemas. Notable examples of such inferences include checking the coherence ofinterschema knowledge; and providing integrated access to a cooperative information …,International Journal of Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems,1993,284
QBD*: A graphical query language with recursion,Michele Angelaccio; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,A system to query databases using diagrams as a standard user interface is proposed. Thesystem; called Query by Diagram*(QBD*); makes use of a conceptual data model; a querylanguage on this model; and a graphical user interface. The conceptual model is the entity-relationship model. The query language; whose expressive power allows recursive queries;supports visual interaction. The main characteristics of the interface are ease of use and theavailability of a rich set of primitives for schema selection and query formulation. Theexpressive power of QBD* and G/sup+/; which are the only languages allowing recursivequeries to be expressed graphically are compared.,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1990,240
Strategic directions in human-computer interaction,Brad Myers; Jim Hollan; Isabel Cruz; Steve Bryson; Dick Bulterman; Tiziana Catarci; Wayne Citrin; Ephraim Glinert; Jonathan Grudin; Yannis Ioannidis,Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people design; implement; and useinteractive computer systems and how computers affect individuals; organizations; andsociety. This encompasses not only ease of use but also new interaction techniques forsupporting user tasks; providing better access to information; and creating more powerfulforms of communication. It involves input and output devices and the interaction techniquesthat use them; how information is presented and requested; how the computer's actions arecontrolled and monitored; all forms of help; documentation; and training; the tools used todesign; build; test; and evaluate user interfaces; and the processes that developers followwhen creating interfaces.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,237

Today; we expect to witness the extension of this revolution withthe wide adoption of meta-data standards like RDF or OWL underpinning the creation of asemantic web. Again; we hope for global properties to emerge from a multiplicity of pair-wise; local interactions; resulting eventually in a self-stabilizing semantic infrastructure. Thispaper represents an effort to summarize the conditions under which this revolution wouldtake place as well as an attempt to underline its main properties; limitations and possibleapplications.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,164
An ontology based visual tool for query formulation support,Tiziana Catarci; Paolo Dongilli; Tania Di Mascio; Enrico Franconi; Giuseppe Santucci; Sergio Tessaris,Abstract In this paper we describe the principles of the design and development of anintelligent query interface; done in the context of the SEWASIE (SEmantic Webs and AgentSin Integrated Economies) European IST project. The SEWASIE project aims at enabling auniform access to heterogeneous data sources through an integrated ontology. The queryinterface is meant to support a user in formulating a precise query-which best capturesher/his information needs-even in the case of complete ignorance of the vocabulary of theunderlying information system holding the data. The intelligence of the interface is driven byan ontology describing the domain of the data in the information system. The final purpose ofthe tool is to generate a conjunctive query ready to be executed by some evaluation engineassociated to the information system.,Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2004,142
Visualization of linear time-oriented data: a survey,Sônia Fernandes Silva; Tiziana Catarci,During the last few years; databases have been growing in size; varieties of data; numbersof users and diversity of applications. Many such applications deal with data characterizedby the temporal dimension (eg medical records; biographical data; financial data; etc.).Typically; end-users of these data are competent in the field of the application but are notcomputer experts. They need easy-to-use systems that are able to support them in the taskof accessing and manipulating the data contained in the databases. It is well-known thatvisual techniques are suitable in supporting users interacting with large data sets. However;not much research has been carried on specifically on the relationship between visualtechniques and time-dependent data.

Managing data quality in cooperative information systems,Massimo Mecella; Monica Scannapieco; Antonino Virgillito; Roberto Baldoni; Tiziana Catarci; Carlo Batini,Abstract Current approaches to the development of cooperative information systems arebased on services to be offered by cooperating organizations; and on the opportunity ofbuilding coordinators and brokers on top of such services. The quality of data exchangedand provided by different services hampers such approaches; as data of low quality canspread all over the cooperative system. At the same time; improvement can be based oncomparing data; correcting them and disseminating high quality data. In this paper; a service-based framework for managing data quality in cooperative information systems is presented.An XML-based model for data and quality data is proposed; and the design of a broker;which selects the best available data from different services; is presented.

A graph-based framework for multiparadigmatic visual access to databases,Tiziana Catarci; Shi-Kuo Chang; Maria Francesca  Costabile; Stefano Levialdi; Giuseppe Santucci,Describes an approach for multiparadigmatic visual access integration of differentinteraction paradigms. The user is provided with an adaptive interface augmented by a usermodel; supporting different visual representations of both data and queries. The visualrepresentations are characterized on the basis of the chosen visual formalisms; namelyforms; diagrams and icons. To access different databases; a unified data model called the"graph model" is used as a common underlying formalism to which databases; expressed inthe most popular data models; can be mapped. Graph model databases are queried throughthe adaptive interface. The semantics of the query operations is formally defined in terms ofgraphical primitives. Such a formal approach permits us to define the concept of an" atomicquery"; which is the minimal portion of a query that can be transferred from one interaction …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,78

Query by diagram: A fully visual query system,Michele Angelaccio; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,The need of a friendly man-machine interaction is becoming crucial for a large variety ofapplications; in particular; those requiring frequent extraction of information from thedatabase. Experience suggests that traditional query languages are not friendly enough forthe causal user: s/he is requested to formulate queries in a textural language; without anyiconic or spatial clues to help the querying process. A new generation of languages (visuallanguages) has been recently investigated; that attempts to make extensive use of theperson's instincts and senses. In this paper we propose a fully visual system; called Queryby Diagram*(QBD*); which is based on a conceptual data model; a query language definedon this model and a graphical user interface.

Fundamental graphical primitives for visual query languages,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; Michele Angelaccio,Abstract The need of a friendly man-machine interaction is becoming crucial for a largevariety of applications. In order to reach such a friendliness a new class of languages hasbeen proposed (Visual Languages); based on the extensive use of graphical and iconicmechanisms. We are interested in a particular subclass of Visual Languages; called VisualQuery Languages (VQLs); devoted to the extraction of information from databases. VQLs aremainly based on the idea of applying new interaction mechanisms; based on the “directmanipulation” paradigm; on visually represented databases. Various VQLs have beenproposed; but only a few of them are provided with a formal definition and; also when such aformal definition exists; it does not give the semantics of the graphical operations performedby the user. In this paper we aim to provide such a semantics by proposing a graphical …,Information Systems,1993,67
Visual Query Systems: A Taxonomy.,Carlo Batini; Tiziana Catarci; Maria Francesca Costabile; Stefano Levialdi,Abstract Visual Query Systems (VQS) are query systems using visual representations todenote the domain of interest and express related requests; they may be seen as anevolution of query languages adopted in database management systems. VQS areinvestigated to solve present day problems of conventional query systems. The mostsignificant needs are: to provide a friendly man-machine interaction; to allow databasesearch by non-technical users; to introduce a mechanism for comfortable navigation even incases of incomplete and ambiguous queries. In order to explain; compare and evaluate thedifferent features of the existing and suggested VQS; a taxonomy is proposed; based onexpressive power; usability and classes of potential users. To clarify some taxonomiccriteria; examples of representative VQS are given.,VDB,1991,67
OntoPIM: how to rely on a personal ontology for Personal Information Management,Vivi Katifori; Antonella Poggi; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci; Yannis Ioannidis,Nowadays; our personal computer contains a huge amount of information; that is stored inseveral different formats; including emails; pictures; text documents; media file; addressbooks; etc. When we need to look for some information; one possibility is to use a keyword-based search tool; such as Google Desktop [1]. We then get several links to documents;mails; databases; etc. that relate to our search but are often too scattered in order to let useasily obtain the information we are looking for; even if this information is actually containedin our desktop. In this paper; we propose a framework for Personal Information Management(PIM); called OntoPIM; that relies on the use of a Personal Ontology; that describes user'sdomain of interest in terms of objects; classes and relations. The ontology is personal in thesense that it reflects the user view of her domain (s) of interest.

Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52

Designing a federated testbed as a distributed system,Robert Ricci; Jonathon Duerig; Leigh Stoller; Gary Wong; Srikanth Chikkulapelly; Woojin Seok,Abstract Traditionally; testbeds for networking and systems research have been stand-alonefacilities: each is owned and operated by a single administrative entity; and is intended to beused independently of other testbeds. However; this isolated facility model is at odds withresearchers' ever-increasing needs for experiments at larger scale and with a broaderdiversity of network technologies. The research community will be much better served by afederated model. In this model; each federated testbed maintains its own autonomy andunique strengths; but all federates work together to make their resources available under acommon framework. Our challenge; then; is to design a federated testbed framework thatbalances competing needs: We must establish trust; but at the same time maintain theautonomy of each federated facility.

Structure Aware XML Object Identification.,Diego Milano; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract The object identification problem is particularly difficult for XML data; due to itsstructural flexibility. Tree edit distances have been used to perform approximatecomparisons among XML trees. However; such distances ignore the semantics implicit inelement labels and nesting relationships of XML data. Furthermore; the use of tree editdistances for unordered trees; that would be more suitable for this task; is computationallyinfeasible. In this paper; we define a new distance for XML data; the structure aware XMLdistance; that overcomes these issues; and present a polynomial algorithm to calculate it.,CleanDB,2006,49
Diagrammatic vs textual query languages: a comparative experiment,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract The significance of usability as one of the most important system characteristics iswidely recognized in all the application fields; including databases. This also implies theinvolvement of the user in the activities of design and testing of any interface. However; veryfew studies aiming at validating the usability of a system have been proposed in thedatabase field; in contrast to many other computer science areas. In this paper we presentan experiment comparing; from the point of view of the ease-of-use; a novel visual querylanguage; namely QBD*; against a well-known traditional textual language such as SQL.The results of the experiment confirmed the superiority of the QBD* approach; which isbased on a conceptual data model; closer to the user view of the reality than the relationalmodel; a visual representation of such a model; more attractive and graspable than a …,*,1995,49

In this paper; we outline the maindifferences between traditional semantic reconciliation methods and these new heuristics.Also; we characterize the resulting emergent semantics systems and provide a couple ofhints vis-à-vis their potential applications.,*,2004,48
Lurking: An underestimated human-computer phenomenon,Martin Ebner; Andreas Holzinger; T Catarci,In this article; the authors offer their perspective about online learning. In general; we knowthat online learning develops through interaction and that it's a collaborative process wherestudents actively engage in writing and reading messages among themselves and with theinstructor. However; it's also well known that in any online community; not all users areequally active; and there are indeed people who never take an active part-the so-calledlurkers. This article focuses on the lurkers; the authors ran extensive experiments todemonstrate whether there's a relationship between the writing and reading behavior ofonline students and whether active participation influences learning efficiency. Aninteresting related result that emerged from the study is that the effort of the instructor interms of reading and writing posts is higher than that of the learners themselves.,IEEE MultiMedia,2005,45
The assignment heuristic for crossing reduction,Tiziana Catarci,Several applications use algorithms for drawing k-layered networks and; in particular; 2-layered networks (ie bipartite graphs). Bipartite graphs are commonly drawn in the plane sothat all vertices lie on two parallel vertical lines; and an important requirement in drawingsuch graphs is to minimize edge crossings. Such a problem is NP-complete even when theposition of the vertices on one layer is held fixed. This paper presents a heuristic; called theassignment heuristic; for edge crossing minimization in bipartite graphs; which works byreducing the problem to an assignment problem. The main idea of the assignment heuristicis to position simultaneously all the vertices of one layer; so that the mutual interaction of theposition of all the vertices can be taken into account. We also show that the idea underlyingthe assignment heuristic can be effectively applied in other cases requiring edge crossing …,IEEE Transactions on Systems; Man; and Cybernetics,1995,43

This view is based on the concept of emergentsemantics; which sees both the representation of semantics and the discovery of the properinterpretation of symbols as the result of a self-organizing process performed by distributedagents exchanging symbols and having utilities dependent on the proper interpretation ofthe symbols. This is a complex systems perspective on the problem of dealing withsemantics. We highlight some of the distinctive features of our vision and point outpreliminary examples of its application.,*,2006,42

A unified model; namely the Graph Model; is used asthe common underlying model; in terms of which databases expressed in the most commondata models can be easily converted. Graph Model databases can be queried by means ofthe multiparadigmatic interface. The semantics of the query operations is formally defined interms of the Graphical Primitives. Such a formal approach enables the query manager tomaintain the same query consistently in any representation.

Visual query operators for temporal databases,Sonia Fernandes; Ulrich Schiel; Tiziana Catarci,Many recent proposals in the literature present easy-to-use query languages; based onvisual representations of the database and direct manipulation mechanisms. Suchproposals essentially deal with conventional query operations; whereas little effort isdevoted to investigate friendly environments for querying temporal databases. Nevertheless;temporal aspects are generally considered extremely relevant in several databaseapplications. Thus; the various users should be provided with powerful and simple querysystems also exhibiting temporal features. While attempting to meet this need; we propose avisual query system for temporal databases. It adopts a diagrammatic representation of thedatabase schema (including temporal classes and relationships); on which conventional aswell as temporal visual query operators can be applied.

Visual strategies for querying databases,Carlo Batini; Tiziana Catarci; Maria Francesca Costabile; Stefano Levialdi,A number of interfaces; based on different techniques which better exploit the humansenses; have been recently suggested and implemented so enlarging the bandwidth of theman-machine communication channel. The availability of graphical devices at low cost hasgiven rise to a large diffusion of visual interfaces. The database field is particularly suited forsuch interfaces mainly because the database is often queried by a casual user; who may notbe conversant with conventional query languages. The use of a visual tool may thereforehelp to access the database; without the dependency on the native language and thelimitations imposed by the specific application area. The authors concentrate on thequerying strategies developed in existing visual query systems (VQS) by defining a suitabletaxonomy and analyzing how these systems can be compared against such a taxonomy.,Visual Languages; 1991.; Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Workshop on,1991,37

Graphical interaction with heterogeneous databases,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; John Cardiff,Abstract. During the past few years our research efforts have been inspired by two differentneeds. On one hand; the number of non-expert users accessing databases is growingapace. On the other; information systems will no longer be characterized by a singlecentralized architecture; but rather by several heterogeneous component systems. In orderto address such needs we have designed a new query system with both user-oriented andmultidatabase features.

Appropriating heuristic evaluation for mobile computing,Enrico Bertini; Tiziana Catarci; A Dix; Silvia Gabrielli; Stephen Kimani; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract Heuristic evaluation has proven popular for desktop and web interfaces; both inpractical design and as a research topic. Compared to full user studies; heuristic evaluationcan be highly cost-effective; allowing a large proportion of usability flaws to be detectedahead of full development with limited resource investment. Mobile computing shares manyusability issues with more conventional interfaces. However; it also poses particularproblems for usability evaluation related to aspects such as limited screen real estate;intermittent user attention; and contextual factors. This article describes a modified collectionof usability heuristics that are designed to be appropriate for evaluation in mobile computing.They have been systematically derived from extensive literature and empirically validated.They therefore offer a sound basis for heuristic-based evaluation in mobile computing …,International Journal of Mobile Human Computer Interaction (IJMHCI),2009,32
Personal ontology creation and visualization for a personal interaction management system,Akrivi Katifori; Costas Vassilakis; Ilias Daradimos; George Lepouras; Yannis Ioannidis; Alan Dix; Antonella Poggi; Tiziana Catarci,ABSTRACT Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction; very useful forcapturing the semantics of information repositories and facilitating their retrieval either by theuser or by the system to support user tasks. This work presents an ontology-based userprofiler; in the context of a Personal Interaction Management System (PIMS). The profiler;based on an ontology of the users' domain; enables them to create their personal ontologyby initially choosing one of the available template ontologies as a starting point; which theysubsequently populate and customize. The profiler employs a web interface which allowsusers to populate their personal ontology through forms; hiding ontology complexities andpeculiarities. Forms are dynamically generated through ontology views; which are specifiedby ontology designers.,Workshop on Personal Information Management; in CHI,2008,32
VidaMine: a visual data mining environment,Stephen Kimani; Stefano Lodi; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; Claudio Sartori,Abstract That the already vast and ever-increasing amounts of data still do presentformidable challenges to effective and efficient acquisition of knowledge is by no means anexaggeration. The knowledge discovery process entails more than just the application ofdata mining strategies. There are many other aspects including; but not limited to: planning;data pre-processing; data integration; evaluation and presentation. The human-visionchannel is capable of recognizing and understanding data at an instant. Effective visualstrategies can be used to tap the outstanding human visual channel in extracting usefulinformation from data. Unlike is the case with most research efforts; the exploitation shouldbe employed not just at the beginning or at the end of the knowledge discovery process butacross the entire discovery process. In essence; this calls for the development of an …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2004,32
Are visual query languages easier to use than traditional ones? An experimental proof,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,The importance of designing query system which are effective and easy to use has beenwidely recognized in the database area. Also; it is well known that the adequacy of a systemcan be mainly tested against actual users in a well settled experiment. However; very fewsuch experiments have been conducted. The overall objective of our study is to measureand understand the comparative ease with which subjects can construct queries in either anovel visual query language; namely QBD*; or a well-known traditional textual languagesuch as SQL. More specifically; we are interested in determining whether there is significantinteraction between:• the query class and the query language type; and• between the type ofquery language and the experience of the user.

Mining constraints for artful processes,Claudio Di Ciccio; Massimo Mecella,Abstract Artful processes are informal processes typically carried out by those people whosework is mental rather than physical (managers; professors; researchers; engineers; etc.); theso called “knowledge workers”. MailOfMine is a tool; the aim of which is to automaticallybuild; on top of a collection of email messages; a set of workflow models that represent theartful processes laying behind the knowledge workers activities. After an outline of theapproach and the tool; this paper focuses on the mining algorithm; able to efficientlycompute the set of constraints describing the artful process.

Ontopim: From personal information management to task information management,George Lepouras; Alan Dix; Akrivi Katifori; Titziana Catarci; Benjamin Habegger; Antonella Poggi; Yannis Ioannidis,Personal Information Management (PIM) aims to support users in the collection; storage andretrieval of their personal information. In such a framework the focus is mainly on how betterto handle the information collected. Task Information Management (TIM) on the other handadopts a more usercentric view and aims to support users in performing their tasks. Possibleways of achieving this are to automatically find data users need in order to perform a task; toautomate the execution of tasks and the synthesis of new more abstract tasks by identifyingtasks users carry out often. PIM and TIM can be seen as complimentary since an efficientorganization of personal information can help in the discovery of data relevant to a task. Tothis end; it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach in the design and implementation of aTask Information Management System.,Personal Information Management: Now That We are Talking; What Are We Learning,2006,29
Using ontologies for xml data cleaning,Diego Milano; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract Real data is often affected by errors and inconsistencies. Many of them depend onthe fact that schemas cannot represent a sufficiently wide range of constraints. Data cleaningis the process of identifying and possibly correcting data quality problems that affect thedata. Cleaning data requires to gather knowledge on the domain to which the data refer.Anyway; existing data cleaning techniques still access this knowledge as a fragmentedcollection of heterogenous rules and ad hoc data transformations. Furthermore; datacleaning methodologies for an important class of data based on the semistructured XMLdata model have not yet been proposed. In this paper we introduce the OXC framework; thatoffers a methodology for XML data cleaning based on a uniform representation of domainknowledge through an ontology We describe how to define XML related data quality …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2005,28
A no-frills approach for accessible Web-based learning material,Valeria Mirabella; Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract Most of the efforts for supporting the preparation and deployment of accessible Web-based learning material propose guidelines that prevalently address technical accessibilityissues. However; little or no consideration is given to the didactical experts; and thus theirdidactical experience; in the learning material development. Moreover; the aforementionedguidelines tend to provide high-level/generic indications on alternative forms of didacticalcontent for equivalent access of the content. Nonetheless; the sole provision of equivalentforms does not guarantee the retention of desirable user interface aspects such aseffectiveness and efficiency. While we do acknowledge the role of such guidelines; we dopropose that the didactical experts be provided with a non-technical recourse that canenable them to contribute to the development process of accessible Web-based learning …,Proceedings of the 2004 international cross-disciplinary workshop on Web accessibility (W4A),2004,28

Task-centred information management,Tiziana Catarci; Alan Dix; Akrivi Katifori; Giorgios Lepouras; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The goal of DELOS Task 4.8 Task-centered Information Management is to providethe user with a Task-centered Information Management system (TIM); which automatesuser's most frequent activities; by exploiting the collection of personal documents. Inprevious work we have explored the issue of managing personal data by enriching themwith semantics according to a Personal Ontology; ie a user-tailored description of herdomain of interest. Moreover; we have proposed a task specification language and a top-down approach to task inference; where the user specifies main aspects of the tasks usingforms of declarative scripting. Recently; we have addressed new challenging issues relatedto TIM user's task inference. More precisely; the first main contribution of this paper is theinvestigation of task inference theoretical issues. In particular; we show how the use of the …,*,2007,27
A proposal toward the development of accessible e-learning content by human involvement,Maria De Marsico; Stephen Kimani; Valeria Mirabella; Kent L Norman; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract Most of the existing efforts for supporting the design; preparation; and deploymentof accessible e-learning applications propose guidelines that primarily address technicalaccessibility issues. Little; if any; consideration is given to the real actors involved in thelearning experience; such as didactical experts and disabled learners. Moreover;implementing artifacts addressed to the e-learning world requires a wide range of particularskills which are related not only to technical but also to didactical; pedagogical; usability;and accessibility aspects of the produced material. This paper argues that the know-how of anumber of stakeholders should be blended into a joint design activity; and that it should bepossible to determine the role of each participant in the successive phases of thedevelopment lifecycle of e-learning applications.

Trusting data quality in cooperative information systems,Luca De Santis; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract Managing the quality of exchanged data is a relevant problem in any cooperativeinformation system. If the quality of exchanged data is not known; the cooperation itself isnegatively affected; indeed; an organization can prefer not requiring data at all; rather thanreceiving bad quality data. Therefore; there is the need of providing mechanisms to certifyorganizations with respect to the quality of data that they spread in the cooperative system.This paper describes a model for trusting cooperating organizations. In such a model; a trustvalue is assigned to each organization with respect to a specific data category. A set ofexperiments shows the effectiveness of the model. Moreover; the design of an architecturalservice that rates organizations on the basis of such model is also described.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2003,27

Supporting cognitive walkthrough with video data: A mobile learning evaluation study,Silvia Gabrielli; Valeria Mirabella; Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract Although expert-based evaluation techniques such as heuristic evaluation andcognitive walkthrough are often inexpensive and quick to apply; they have not proved to beeffective in capturing contextual factors that arise in real-world settings. It is no trivial issue tounderstand how such evaluation techniques could be modified or differently applied so as tobetter take into account context; without loosing the advantages inherent in thosetechniques. This paper explores a possible way of addressing the trade-off betweenapplication of cognitive walkthrough and low cost improvements of its contextual validity. Inparticular; we propose and investigate the benefits of supporting cognitive walkthrough withvideo data about user interaction with an eLearning course on mobile device.

Web-based information access,Tiziana Catarci,The need for friendly environments for effective information access is further enforced by thegrowth of the global Internet; which is causing a dramatic change in both the kind of peoplewho access the information and the types of information itself (ranging from unstructuredmultimedia data to traditional record-oriented data). To cope with these new demands; theinteraction techniques traditionally offered to the users have to evolve and eventuallyintegrate in a powerful interface to the global information infrastructure. The new interactionmechanisms must be especially friendly and easy-to-use; since; given the enormousquantity of information sources available on the Internet; most of the users remain"permanent novices" with respect to each one of the sources they have access to.

Visual metaphors for interacting with databases,Tiziana Catarci; Maria F Costabile; Maristella Matera,Abstract The need for better human-computer interaction (HCI) has been widely recognizedand discussed; even in the database area. It is generally accepted that the quality of theinteraction mainly depends on the interface characteristics. How does one recognize" good"interfaces? The use of a suitable metaphor is crucial. Unfortunately; to put it as a metaphor;speaking about metaphors in HCI is like walking on a slippery floor. We would like to comeup with a definition of metaphor that is specific to the particular needs of the database area;and; of course; of the database users. Thus; we will highlight some peculiarities of thedatabase interaction. The following considerations should constitute a basis towards aformal approach for the construction of effective metaphors for interacting with databases.,Acm Sigchi Bulletin,1995,26

Also; it is well known that the adequacy of asystem should be tested against actual users in a well monitored experiment. However; veryfew such experiments have been conducted. The objective of our study is to measure andunderstand the comparative ease with which subjects can construct queries in two kinds ofvisual languages; one diagrammatic and the other iconic. More specifically; we areinterested in determining if there is significant interaction between: 1) the query class andthe query language type; and 2) the type of query language and the experience of the user.Experimental results indicate that the effectiveness of a diagrammatic or an iconic querylanguage varies depending on the classes of queries and the kinds of users.

Conceptual Views over the Web.,Tiziana Catarci; Luca Iocchi; Daniele Nardi; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract The Internet has made available an enormous quantity of information to a disparatevariety of people. The amount of information; the typical access modality (ie browsing); andthe open growth of the Net; force the puzzled user to search the information of interest in alabyrinth of billions of links. This is very di erent from traditional database querying; wherethe user has just the duty of specifying which are the data s/he wants to retrieve. We arguethat; in order to provide the user with a powerful and friendly query mechanism for accessinginformation on the Web; the critical problem is to nd e ective ways to build models of theinformation of interest. In this paper we motivate the above observation by presentingnotable attempts to construct systems which model the information in the Web following dierent approaches.

Effective automated object matching,Diego Zardetto; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci,Object Matching (OM) is the problem of identifying pairs of data-objects coming from differentsources and representing the same real world object. Several methods have been proposedto solve OM problems; but none of them seems to be at the same time fully automated andvery effective. In this paper we present a fundamentally new suite of methods that insteadpossesses both these abilities. We adopt a statistical approach based on mixture models;which structures an OM process into two consecutive tasks. First; mixture parameters areestimated by fitting the model to observed distance measures between pairs. Then; aprobabilistic clustering of the pairs into Matches and Unmatches is obtained by exploitingthe fitted model. In particular; we use a mixture model with component densities belonging tothe Beta parametric family and we fit it by means of an original perturbation-like technique …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,20
Driving usability into the public administration: the Italian experience,Tiziana Catarci; Giacinto Matarazzo; Gianluigi Raiss,Abstract The Italian Public Administration (PA) represents an important testbed for fulfilmentof software usability in real settings. This is due to the volume of existing applications; thevarious types of ongoing projects and the potential users to whom the produced applicationsare addressed (both internal PA users and citizen-users). Most acquisitions of computerproducts in the PA are made in terms of ad hoc developments. This type of developmentcould provide; in principle; the best condition for usability purposes; ie a constant contiguitybetween designers and users. Unfortunately; this does not lead to user-centred projects andusable products in reality. To analyse the current situation and propose improvements; theItalian authority which controls the software diffusion in PAs (Autorità per l'Informatica nellaPubblica Amministrazione—AIPA) created a working group; the Usability Working Group …,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,2002,20

Goal of Esteem is to go beyond the existing state-of-the-artsolutions for P2P knowledge sharing and to provide an integrated platform for both data andservice discovery. A distinguishing feature of Esteem is the use of semantic communities toexplicitly give shape to the collective knowledge and expertise of peer groups with similarinterests.

Foundations of the DARE system for drawing adequate representations,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; Maria Francesca Costabile; Isabel Cruz,We consider the problem of automatically visualizing information contained in a databaseand propose a framework that addresses the issues involved. Our approach does notdepend on the particular data model used; the size of the instance set; or the nature of thedata being represented. The aim of the framework is to produce a correct; complete; andpossibly highly effective visual representation. Such properties of the visual representationare made possible by the consistency of a set of logic rules contained in a knowledge base.These rules express facts and relationships about the visual domain; the data domain; themapping between both domains; and the perceptual domain.,Database Applications in Non-Traditional Environments; 1999.(DANTE'99) Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on,1999,18

The DaQuinCIS broker: Querying data and their quality in cooperative information systems,Massimo Mecella; Monica Scannapieco; Antonino Virgillito; Roberto Baldoni; Tiziana Catarci; Carlo Batini,Abstract In cooperative information systems; the quality of data exchanged and provided bydifferent data sources is extremely important. A lack of attention to data quality can implydata of low quality to spread all over the cooperative system. At the same time; improvementcan be based on comparing data; correcting them and disseminating high quality data. Inthis paper; a framework and a related architecture for managing data quality in cooperativeinformation systems is proposed; as developed in the context of the DaQuinCIS researchproject. Then the focus concentrates (i) on an XML-based model for data and quality data;and (ii) on the design of a broker; which selects the best available data from differentsources; such a broker also supports the improvement of data based on feedbacks to datasources. The broker is the basic component of the DaQuinCIS architecture.,*,2003,16
Wag: Web-at-a-glance,Tiziana Catarci; S-K Chang; Daniele Nardi; Giuseppe Santucci; Maurizio Lenzerini,The Internet revolution has made an enormous quantity of information available to adisparate variety of people.

A hypergraph-based framework for visual interaction with databases,Tiziana Catarci; Laura Tarantino,Abstract The advent of graphical workstations has led to a new generation of interactiontools in database systems; where the use of graphics greatly enhances the quality of theinteraction. Yet; Visual Query Languages present some limitations; deriving partly from theirown paradigm and partly from the available technology. One of the basic drawbacks is thelack of formalization; in contrast to the well-established traditional languages. In this paperwe propose a theoretical framework for visual interaction with databases; having a particularkind of hypergraph; the Structure Modeling Hypergraph (SMH); as a representation tool;able to capture the features of existing data models. SMHs profit from the basic property ofdiagrams while overcoming their limitations. Notable characteristics of SMHs are: uniformand unified representation of intensional and extensional aspects of databases; direct …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,1995,16
On the Expressive Power of Graphical Query Languages.,Tiziana Catarci,Abstract In this paper a comparison is presented between the expressive power of genericgraphical mechanisms and the various classes of queries (first-order; fixpoint;programming). A precise evaluation of the expressive power of the languages based onsuch mechanisms (ie purely graphical query languages) is shown. Moreover; an informalanalysis is provided relatively to the more general class of the visual query languages;supporting also iconic interaction.,VDB,1991,16
From the web of data to a world of action,Alan Dix; Giorgos Lepouras; Akrivi Katifori; Costas Vassilakis; Tiziana Catarci; Antonella Poggi; Yannis Ioannidis; Miguel Mora; Ilias Daradimos; Nazihah Md Akim; Shah Rukh Humayoun; Fabio Terella,Abstract This paper takes as its premise that the web is a place of action; not just information;and that the purpose of global data is to serve human needs. The paper presents severalcomponent technologies; which together work towards a vision where many small micro-applications can be threaded together using automated assistance to enable a unified andrich interaction. These technologies include data detector technology to enable any text tobecome a start point of semantic interaction; annotations for web-based services so that theycan link data to potential actions; spreading activation over personal ontologies; to allowmodelling of context; algorithms for automatically inferring 'typing'of web-form input databased on previous user inputs; and early work on inferring task structures from action traces.Some of these have already been integrated within an experimental web-based …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2010,15
A flexible video streaming system for urban traffic control,Manuel Esteve; Carlos E Palau; T Catarci,This article discusses an innovative system for traffic management that is presently underinstallation in the city of Valencia. Key features of the system are to exploit open sourcesoftware components and use MPEG-4 video streaming over an Internet protocol. The videostreaming management is particularly sophisticated; resulting in a flexible; efficient; andreliable service. Another important element is the communication network design. In thiscase; the main issues to address were flexibility; scalability; and fault tolerance. The authorssuccessfully addressed these issues by using a hierarchical network structure; with physicalredundancy; based on spanning tree protocols. The overall system is specifically for urbantraffic control; but some of its characteristics could make it easily reconfigurable to differentcontexts and environments.,IEEE MultiMedia,2006,15
Interacting with databases in the global information infrastructure,Tiziana Catarci,The growth of the global Internet is causing a dramatic change in both the kind of peoplewho access information and the types of information itself; ranging from unstructuredmultimedia data to traditional record-oriented data. To cope with these new needs; theinteraction techniques traditionally offered to DBMS users have to evolve and eventuallyintegrate in a powerful interface to the global information infrastructure. In particular; from theuser's point of view there is the need for both effective visualization of multimedia informationand retrieval tools able to overcome the existing dichotomy between browsing and querying.This article concentrates on the mutual relationship between database querying and Internetnavigation by reviewing some important contributions from different areas; such asinformation retrieval; database research; and visualization techniques.,IEEE Communications Magazine,1997,15

We start bypositioning the problem in the recent line of evolution of search engine interfaces; whichmore and more are capable of mining semantic concepts and associations from text dataand presenting them in sophisticated ways that depend on the type of the extracted data.The approach to visualization proposed in search computing extends current practices inseveral ways: the data to visualize are N-dimensional combinations of objects; with rankingcriteria associated both to individual objects and to sets of combinations; object's propertiescan be classified in several types; for which optimized visualization families are preferred(eg; timelines for temporal data; maps for geo-located information); combinations mayexhibit any number of relevant properties to be displayed; which need to fit to the bi …,*,2011,14
The workpad user interface and methodology: Developing smart and effective mobile applications for emergency operators,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Tiziana Catarci; Massimiliano de Leoni; Andrea Marrella; Massimo Mecella; Manfred Bortenschlager; Renate Steinmann,Abstract In complex emergency/disaster scenarios; teams from various emergency-responseorganizations collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. The use of smart mobiledevices and applications in these scenarios can improve this collaboration dynamically; andposes interesting challenges; such as user'mental attention; small screen size; unavailabilityof reliable network; reduced power; and battery consumption. So; to design and developinteractive applications to be used in mobile and pervasive scenarios requires novelmethodologies which combine user-centred design approaches and software engineeringapproaches tailed for distributed architectures. In this paper; we outline the methodology;adopted successfully in the European WORKPAD project; and describe the work done fromgetting the requirements to developing the interface of the desired system.,International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction,2009,14

Accessible e-learning material: A no-frills avenue for didactical experts,Valeria Mirabella*; Stephen Kimani; Silvia Gabrielli; Tiziana Catarci,Different organizations adopt accessibility for various and diverse reasons. Interesting andinspiring as such reasons may be; it is important to ensure that the motivation for supportingaccessibility is that it is the right thing to do; ie a commitment to the provision of equalopportunities for accessing resources for people with special needs. Among the variousefforts for supporting the development of accessible e-learning material; most of thempropose guidelines that prevalently address technical accessibility issues (such as theformat and navigation of learning material) with little or no consideration for the didacticalexperts; and thus their didactical experience; in developing learning material.

Semantic query processing in the VENUS environment,John Cardiff; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Recent years have seen the publication of several methodologies for query processing in aMultidatabase (MDB) environment. Whilst different approaches are pertinent to specific CISarchitectures; the issue of efficiency of processing has received relatively little attention. Thisis somewhat surprising considering the potentially large costs associated with MDB queries.In this paper; we consider the efficiency of processing queries in the VENUS (Esprit 6398)environment. The goal of this system is to allow a user to query multiple data sources byinteracting with a conceptually single database; and by providing a query interface based onthe use of visual formalisms. This system takes advantage of existing multidatabase queryprocessing strategies; and deals with optimization issues by considering the exploitation ofinter-and intra-schema semantics. We present a methodology which harnesses …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,1997,14
UEMan: A tool to manage user evaluation in development environments,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Yael Dubinsky; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract One of the challenges in software development is to collect and analyze the endusers' feedback in an effective and efficient manner. In this paper we present a tool tomanage user evaluation alongside the process of software development. The tool is basedon the idea that user evaluation should be managed iteratively from within the integrateddevelopment environment (IDE) in order to provide high quality user interface. The maincapabilities include creating the experiment object as part of the software project; derivingdevelopment tasks from the analysis of evaluation data; and tracing these tasks to and fromthe code. Further; we provide a library to enable development of Java aspects for creation ofautomatic measures to increase the body of the evaluation data.

This ispart of the wider vision of DELOS Task 4.8 Task-centered Information Management; whichaims to create a more activity or task-focused interaction environment for users; taking theirindividual library of digital information and turning it into a resource for automated support.The two techniques described in this paper are (i) a spreading activation algorithm operatingover the user's personal ontology which enables a form of temporal context or memory and(ii) a rule inference algorithm that takes examples of completed forms and infers how thefields map to generic subgaps of the ontology.,Proc. of DELOS Conference 2007,2007,13
Structure everything,Tiziana Catarci; Luna Dong; Alon Halevy; Antonella Poggi,The availability of vast amounts of information on the Internet and the sharp decrease in thecost of digital storage has enabled today's desktops to become personal informationarchives. Desktops contain collections of work-and hobbyrelated data as well as richcollections of personal multimedia files. However; the typical lack of structure of one'sdesktop data makes it difficult for the user to easily search and benefit from the information itcontains. Consider an example; a scenario where Alex's laptop contains a huge amount ofinformation that is stored in several different formats; including emails; pictures; textdocuments; media files; address books; and more. In particular; Alex uses email extensivelyto communicate with many friends; his mother; Connie; and his sister; Brooke.

Intelligent user task oriented systems,Tiziana Catarci; Benjamin Habegger; Antonella Poggi,Most existing human-computer interfaces are now based on the WIMP (Windows; Icons;Menus; Pointers) paradigm and on the desktop metaphor. Each application is targetedtowards editing one specific type of “document”. Current desktop oriented systems proposea mostly disconnected set of generic tools (word processor; e-mail reader; drawing tool; CDburning application; etc.). In such a setting; a user which is executing a specific task (egmaking a CD from a set of files) will likely use more than one of these tools. The fact that theyare running on one system without being connected leads to awkward situations such as theuser reentering or copying data between applications. Furthermore; the same user is verylikely to run multiple times the same task and often; she will do this in a similar manner. Forexample; a music fan will likely find himself burning more than one music CD. Having a …,Personal Information Management: Now That We’re Talking; What Are We Learning?,2006,12

A multiparadigmatic environment for interacting with databases,T Catarci; MF Costabile; A Massari; L Saladini; G Santucci,Abstract We present a prototype system to be used for visually accessing heterogeneousdatabases. The basic idea is to provide the user with several visual representations of dataas well as multiple interaction mechanisms for both querying databases and visualizing thequery results. Since some visual representations better fit certain user classes; the systemadapts to the user's needs by switching to the most appropriate visual representation andinteraction mechanism; according to a suitable user model. The data and queryrepresentations are consistent in every paradigm. Such a notion of consistency stems fromformal basis; ie a twofold data/representation model; namely the Graph Model; and a set ofbasic Graphical Primitives. This formal approach allows the user to switch from oneinteraction paradigm to another; always saving the query state.,ACM SIGCHI Bulletin,1996,12

An interactive visual exploration of medical data for evaluating health centres,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; Sonia Fernandes Silva,It is well known that visualisation techniques are suitable for an effective exploration of largedata sets. However; not much research has been carried out on applying visualisationtechniques in the analysis of medical data apart from image data. Medical informationsystems collect a vast amount of monitored clinical data coming from specialised machines.The task of accessing and interpreting the portions of data that are relevant to theidentification of a specific clinical problem can become a hard task. In order to address thisproblem; we propose to enhance medical information systems by providing an interactivevisual exploration of large data sets.

Formalizing visual interaction with historical databases,Sonia Fernandes Silva; Tiziana Catarci; Ulrich Schiel,Abstract Recent database applications are typically oriented towards a large set of non-expert users; and therefore; they need to be equipped with suitable interfaces facilitating theinteraction with the system. Moreover; the incorporation of the time dimension in databasesystems is a desirable feature. Indeed; several temporal data models and the correspondingtextual query languages have been proposed. However; there is a limited amount ofresearch concerning the investigation of user-oriented languages for querying temporaldatabases. Our proposal addresses such a need. In particular; we propose a visual queryenvironment; namely Temporal Visual Query Environment (TVQE) which provides an easierinteraction of the user with temporal databases.

Building a digital library of newspaper clippings: The LAURIN project,Diego Calvanese; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,The field of digital libraries has attracted a lot of research during the last years. However noproject has specifically taken into account the problem of building a digital library ofnewspaper clippings. It is well known that a great deal of cultural knowledge is stored in thenewspapers of yesterday. Since newspapers are not always easily accessible; specialclipping archives were created in the 20th century. People interested in newspaperinformation benefit from these archives because the work of selecting; cutting and indexingarticles is done by specialists. In order to maintain their important position in the informationmarket; clipping archives should be able to integrate their special skills (such asprofessional knowledge and experience in gathering and treating newspaper information)into the new technologies of the information society.

A boosting approach to econtent development for learners with special needs,Silvia Gabrielli; Valeria Mirabella; Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci,ABSTRACT Of late there has been a growing interest and effort toward meeting therequirements of persons with special needs. However; most of the accessibility standardsand guidelines that have been proposed have been developed by adopting a domainindependent and often 'technical'perspective. Such proposals are therefore often notsufficient to achieve accessibility goals in specific application areas such as eLearning. Thispaper presents a boosting approach/framework toward the development of more effectiveand usable accessibility indications for authors of didactic content; which are currently beingfed and tested within the Italian context of the VICE project. This approach is intended to takeinto account the aforementioned issue and to make a step forward with respect to existingaccessibility proposals and approaches in the eLearning domain.

Which Metaphor for Which Database?,Tiziana Catarci; Maria Francesca Costabile; Maristella Matera,The role of the users and their needs are now recognized in the database community. Manyefforts are devoted to improve the quality of the interaction between the user and thedatabase. For designing better interfaces that make the systems more usable; the use ofsuitable metaphors is crucial. The problem we address in this paper is whether anappropriate notion of metaphor can be tailored to the database interaction; so reflecting thepeculiarities and needs of this specific field. Our argument originates from a recentlypublished paper that presents a formalism whose aim is to provide a framework for flexibleuse; definition; and evaluation of visual metaphors in the specific case of databaseschemata. By discussing such a paper; we try to clarify concepts such as metaphor; datamodel; visual representation; etc. We also highlight some peculiarities of the database …,BCS HCI,1995,10

Towards user centric schema mapping platform,Guilian Wang; Rami Rifaieh; Joseph Goguen; Vitaliy Zavesov; Arcot Rajasekar; Mark Miller,Abstract Schema mapping is a fundamental problem in many important databaseapplications. The process of mapping discovery is complex and error prone; it cannot befully automated; so user input is necessary. This paper presents SCIA; a system that assistsusers in creating executable mappings between a source schema and a target schema byautomating simple matches and finding critical points where user input is both necessaryand maximally useful. SCIA finds critical points by using path contexts together with acombination of multiple matching algorithms. SCIA also helps users; when a critical pointoccurs; by asking them specific questions with sufficient context and making suggestions foradding semantic information to data transformation; such as join and grouping conditions.SCIA handles complex mappings involving n-to-m matches with semantic functions and …,International Workshop on Semantic Data and Service Integration; SDSI 2007,2007,9

V ery often; such an interface exploits the power of visualization and direct manipulation mechanisms. How ever; it is not sufficient toassociate" any" visual represen tation to a database; but the visual representation should becarefully chosen to effectively con vey all and only the database information content. We arecurren tly w orkingon a general theory (see 1) for establishing the adequacy of a visualrepresentation; once specified the database characteristics; and we are developing asystem; called D ARE: Drawing Adequate REpresentations; which implements such atheory.

A dynamic framework for multi-view task modeling,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Tiziana Catarci; Yael Dubinsky,Abstract We propose a dynamic way to model task structures from multi viewpoints atdifferent abstraction levels. For this; we provide a multi-view task modeling framework thatdefines a two-layered approach: at conceptual-level specific framework concepts forproviding a conceptual foundation to model and structure tasks at different abstractionlevels; and at representation-level through a formal task modeling language. The motivationbehind this is decoupling the complexity of the underlying system behavior and businesslogic; and giving a comprehensive picture from all perspectives. The framework conceptsand the language are customizable and extendible; thus enabling the framework to be usedfor creating task models for different purposes; from system analysis to performing usabilityevaluation. We provide details of a case study in which we successfully used the …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCHI Italian Chapter International Conference on Computer-Human Interaction: Facing Complexity,2011,8
Towards inferring ratings from user behavior in BitTorrent communities,Róbert Ormándi; István Hegedus; Kornél Csernai; Márk Jelasity,Peer-to-peer file-sharing has been increasingly popular in the last decade. In most cases file-sharing communities provide only minimal functionality; such as search and download. Extrafeatures such as recommendation are difficult to implement because users are typicallyunwilling to provide sufficient rating information for the items they download. For this reason;it would be desirable to utilize user behavior to infer implicit ratings. For example; if a userdeletes a file after downloading it; we could infer that the rating is low; or if the user isseeding the file for a long time; the rating is high. In this paper we demonstrate that it isindeed possible to infer implicit ratings from user behavior. We work with a large trace ofFilelist. org; a BitTorrent-based private community; and demonstrate that we can identify abinary like/dislike distinction over the set of files users are downloading; using dynamic …,Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE); 2010 19th IEEE International Workshop on,2010,8
Appropriating Heuristic Evaluation Methods for Mobile Computing,Enrico Bertini; Tiziana Catarci; Alan Dix; Silvia Gabrielli; Stephen Kimani; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract Heuristic evaluation has proven popular for desktop and Web interfaces; both inpractical design and as a research topic. Compared to full user studies; heuristic evaluationcan be highly cost-effective; allowing a large proportion of usability flaws to be detectedahead of full development with limited resource investment. Mobile computing shares manyusability issues with more conventional interfaces. However; it also poses particularproblems for usability evaluation related to aspects such as limited screen real estate;intermittent user attention; and contextual factors. This chapter describes a modifiedcollection of usability heuristics that are designed to be appropriate for evaluation in mobilecomputing. They have been systematically derived from extensive literature and empiricallyvalidated. They therefore offer a sound basis for heuristic-based evaluation in mobile …,*,2008,8

Three are themain characteristics of the language: 1) the types of modeling primitives of the language areparticularly suited for representing objects from a statistical point of view; 2) the languageincludes a rich set of structuring mechanisms for both elementary and summary data; whichare given a formal semantics by means of logic; 3) the language is equipped withspecialized inference procedures; allowing for performing different kinds of checks on therepresentation.,VLDB,1990,8
QBD: a fully visual system for ER oriented databases,Michele Angelaccio; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,The need of a friendly man-machine interaction is becoming crucial for a large variety ofapplications; in particular; those requiring frequent extraction of information from thedatabase. Experience suggests that traditional query languages are not friendly enough forthe casual user: she/he is requested to formulate queries in a textual language; without anyiconic or spatial clues to help the querying process. A new generation of languages (visuallanguages) has been recently investigated; that attempts to make extensive use of theperson's instincts and senses. The authors propose a fully visual system; called Query byDiagram (QBD); which is based on a conceptual data model; a query language defined onthis model and a graphical user interface. The main characteristics of the interface are theease of use; and the availability of a rich set of primitives for both schema selection and …,Visual Languages; 1989.; IEEE Workshop on,1989,8

Controlling domotic appliances via a ‘dynamical’P300-based brain computer interface,F Aloise; D Ferriero; A Ruiu; G Santucci; T Catarci; D Mattia; F Babiloni; F Cincotti,Abstract. The brain computer interface (BCI) technology allows a direct connection betweenbrain and computer without any muscular activity required; and thus it offers a uniqueopportunity to enhance and/or to restore communication and actions into external word inpeople with severe motor disability. The P300 potentials recorded from the scalp represent asuitable BCI signal control for applications like environmental control. Here we present a setof findings that confirm the feasibility of a real domotic environmental control operated viaP300-based BCI. Furthermore; the relevant issue of a low bit rate of command execution isaddressed by the implementation of a dynamical BCI interface whose upgrade is based on acontinuous real-time collection of information from the environment.,Assistive Technology from Adapted Equipment to Inclusive Environments: AAATE 2009,2009,7

Web rendering systems: Techniques; classification criteria and challenges,Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci; Isabel Cruz,Abstract Access to information scattered all over the world is becoming increasingly commonsince the Web is the widest information repository. However; finding; organizing; andclassifying the information of interest among the massive amount of information are veryhard tasks. Other challenges include the broad user base; which mainly consists of userswith little or no background in computer science. The new goal is direct interaction with thefinal user (the person who is searching for information; and is not necessarily familiar withcomputer technology); for expressing information requests and conveying results. Directmanipulation is typically achieved in visual environments. The well-known high bandwidth ofthe human-vision channel allows both recognition and understanding of large quantities ofinformation in no more than a few seconds.,*,2003,7

On the one side; this is extremely useful and exciting. On the other side; the evergrowing amount of information at disposal generates cognitive overload and even anxiety; especiallyin novice or occasional users. Interfaces for interacting with databases are usually too hostilefor novices and/or inadequate for experts. The problem of easily extracting information from databaseshas been discussed extensively among the database community.

Database querying by hypergraph manipulation,Tiziana Catarci; Laura Tarantino,Abstract In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for visual interaction withdatabases; having a particular kind of hypergraph; the Structure Modeling Hypergraph(SMH); as a representation tool able to capture the essential features of existing datamodels. Notable characteristics of SMHs are: uniform and unified representation of bothintensional and extensional aspects of databases; direct representation of containmentrelationships; and immediate applicability of direct manipulation primitives. In particular; wedefine some basic direct-manipulation primitives (IPs); which can be composed andsequenced to build meaningful queries. The interpretation of well-formed IP sequences isgiven in terms of an operational semantics. Note that the result of querying an SMH is still anSMH;(ie; the model is closed under the query operations). Finally; by specializing our …,*,1995,7

Currently available systems;however; face a major challenge. On todays global information infrastructure; datasemantics is more and more context-and time-dependent; and cannot be fixed once and forall at design time. Identifying emerging relationships among previously unrelatedinformation items (eg; during data interchange) may dramatically increase their businessvalue.

Usability of XML query languages,Joris Petrus Maria Graaumans,The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language which enables re-use ofinformation. Specific query languages for XML are developed to facilitate this. There arelarge differences between history; design goal; and syntax of the XML query languages.However; in practice these languages are used for similar purposes. The motivation for aparticular design decision is often not clear. Also it is not clear if a particular design choiceinfluences the user's effectiveness with a query language. In this study the usability of mostimportant query language candidates are investigated. Usability is: the performance and thesatisfaction of users measured in relation to a set of tasks. Not much is known about theusability of formal languages. In chapter 2 an overview is provided of former research of theusability of database query languages.

Graphical interaction with historical databases,Sonia Fernandes Silva; Tiziana Catarci,Recent database applications are typically oriented towards a large set of non-expert usersand therefore they need to be equipped with suitable interfaces facilitating the interactionwith the system. It has been pointed out that temporal data constitute a growing part of suchrecent applications. However; there are not many proposals of systems providing the userwith a friendly and effective environment to interact with temporal data. Our workconcentrates on a user-oriented visual query system (called TVQE) for temporal databases.The system adopts a diagrammatic representation of the database schema and a" graphicalnotebook" as metaphor to allow the user to easily formulate conventional and temporalqueries. The visual interaction mechanisms of TVQE are provided with precise syntax andsemantics founded on formally defined graph based data model and minimal set of …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1999.

A multiparadigmatic visual environment for adaptive access to databases,Tiziana Catarci; Shi-Kuo Chang; Maria Francesca Costabile; Stefano Levialdi; Giuseppe Santucci,Visual Query Languages(VQLS) are query languages essentially based on the use of visualrepresentations to depict the domain of interest and express the related requests. Systemsimplementing a visual query language are called Visual Query Systems (VQSS)(a survey isin [1]). In recent years; many VQSS have been proposed in the literature adopting a range ofdifferent visual representations and interaction strategies. However; existing VQSS generallyrestrict the human-computer communication to only one kind of interaction paradigm. On thecontrary; the presence of several paradigms; each one with different chamcteristics andadvantages; will help both naive and experienced users to interact with the system. Forinstance; icons may well evoke the objects present in the database; while relationshipsamong them may be better expressed through the edges of a graph; and collections of …,INTERACT'93 and CHI'93 Conference Companion on Human Factors in Computing Systems,1993,6

Real time vision based object detection from UAV aerial images: a conceptual framework,AFM Saifuddin Saif; Anton Satria Prabuwono; Zainal Rasyid Mahayuddin,Abstract In computer vision research; one of the capabilities of establishing an autonomousUAV is the detection of rigid and non-rigid object. Moving object detection with movingcameras from UAV aerial images is still an unsolved issue due to clutter and ruralbackground contained in the images; even and uneven illumination changes; static andmoving objects and motion of camera. This paper presents a conceptual framework formoving object detection with moving camera from UAV aerial images combined with theframe difference and segmentation approach together. Our focus is the human as rigid andvehicle as non rigid object detection where the camera can be mounted on the vehicle orother movable platform. It is expected that the proposed conceptual framework performs wellunder different situations for uneven environments.,FIRA RoboWorld Congress,2013,5

One of the key challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of On-TIME; isthe design of a user friendly interface. Being On-TIME based on the use of a so-calledPersonal Ontology to provide a semantic account to user's personal data; the interface hasto allow the user to easily browse the ontology. On the other hand; it has to address themanagement of tasks. This requires to both suggest tasks that the user might be willing toperform; and to support her while executing tasks.

Visual modeling of temporal data in usability experiments,Sônia Fernandes Silva; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract In most recent Visual Query Systems (VQSs); there is the attempt to address thedifferent needs of various classes of users by developing adaptive interfaces having afundamental component in the user model module. Within this context; we argue that thetemporal issues are a key factor in modeling th user's interaction; and also in carrying outrelated usability analysis on VQSs. Hence; we propose a uniform framework for modelingand manipulating several kinds of time-based information related with VQSs; which exploitsa graph-based formalism; equipped with visual temporal operators. In this paper; weconcentrate on the time-based information which are derived from usability experiments. Inparticular; we show that the history of the user's interaction can be accessed anddynamically maintained by using such visual temporal operators. This approach is an …,*,1998,5
Exploitation of Interschema Knowledge in a Multidatabase System.,John Cardiff; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract We describe a logic language to formally express interdependencies betweenclasses belonging to different schemas; the socalled interschema knowledge. Theseinterdependencies allow a designer of a multidatabase (MDB) to establish relationshipsbetween both the intensional definition and the set of instances of classes represented indifferent schemas. These assertions form the „backbone “of the MDB and we may benefit inseveral ways from the possibility of reasoning about them.

Mutual hand representation for telexistence robots using projected virtual hands,MHD Saraiji; Charith Lasantha Fernando; Kouta Minamizawa; Susumu Tachi,Abstract In this paper; a mutual body representation for Telexistence Robots that does nothave physical arms were discussed. We propose a method of projecting user's hands as avirtual superimposition that not only the user sees through a HMD; but also to the remoteparticipants by projecting virtual hands images into the remote environment with a smallprojector aligned with robot's eyes. These virtual hands are produced by capturing user'shands from the first point of view (FPV); and then segmented from the background. Thismethod expands the physical body representation of the user; and allows mutual bodycommunication between the user and remote participants while providing a betterunderstanding user's hand motion and intended interactions in the remote place.,Proceedings of the 6th Augmented Human International Conference,2015,4

Substantial work has been done on how to detect such shot boundariesautomatically (Arman et aI.; 1993)(Zhang et aI.; 1993)(Zhang et aI.; 1995)(Kobla et aI.; 1997).Through the inte gration of technologies such as image processing; speech/characterrecognition and natural language understanding; keywords can be extracted and associatedwith these shots for indexing (Wactlar et aI.; 1996). A single shot; however; rarely carriesenough amount of information to be meaningful by itself. Usu ally; it is a semanticallymeaningful interval that most users are interested in re trieving.

Task-based user-system interaction,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Antonella Poggi; Tiziana Catarci; Alan Dix,Abstract In current electronic environments; the ever-increasing amount of personalinformation; means that users focus more on managing their information rather than using itto accomplish their objectives. To overcome this problem; a user task-based interactiveenvironment is needed to help users focus on tasks they wish to perform rather thanspending more time on managing their personal information. In this paper; we present partsof our on-going work on task-based user-system interaction; which highlights the need for ashift from an information-centric to a task-centric environment. More precisely; we look intoissues relating to modeling user tasks that arise when users interact with the environment tofulfill their goals through these sets of tasks.,KI-Künstliche Intelligenz,2012,4
Emergent semantics and cooperation in multi-knowledge communities: the esteem approach,Devis Bianchini; Stefano Montanelli; Carola Aiello; Roberto Baldoni; Cristiana Bolchini; Silvia Bonomi; Silvana Castano; Tiziana Catarci; Valeria De Antonellis; Alfio Ferrara; Michele Melchiori; Elisa Quintarelli; Monica Scannapieco; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In the present global society; information has to be exchangeable in open anddynamic environments; where interacting users do not necessarily share a commonunderstanding of the world at hand. This is particularly true in P2P scenarios; where millionsof autonomous users (peers) need to cooperate by sharing their resources (such as dataand services). We propose the E steem approach (Emergent Semantics and cooperaTion inmulti-knowledgE EnvironMents); where a comprehensive framework and a platform for dataand service discovery in P2P systems are proposed; with advanced solutions for trust andquality-based data management; P2P infrastructure definition; query processing anddynamic service discovery in a context-aware scenario.

Multi-channel Adaptive Information Systems,Paolo Atzeni; Tiziana Catarci; Barbara Pernici,Current Web applications access information and services in a variety of ways. Severalinteraction devices are available; access is becoming more and more mobile andubiquitous; also due to a convergence of technologies traditionally belonging to separateareas; such as computer networks; traditional mass media; and advanced telephoneservices. Multiple interaction channels are projected to become prominent in the next fewyears. Users will access services and information in a variety of ways; from multiplelocations; using different devices at different times; and combining the use of different inputand output channels in multimodal interactions; involving the use of traditional (portable)computers through Web interfaces; audio and vocal interaction; digitally augmented paper.Several applications are emerging; taking advantage of these new environments; and are …,World Wide Web,2007,4
A user-based method for speech interface development,Yael Dubinsky; Tiziana Catarci; Stephen Kimani,Abstract There is a consensus on the significance and high contribution of user involvementin the process of user interfaces development. However; there is no standard way toimplement user involvement in software development processes. Dealing with speech-based interfaces that involve vocal interaction of speaking and hearing; the need of userinvolvement is increased. In this paper; we focus on the characteristics of speech interfacedevelopment and suggest a user-based method that enables continuous user evaluation.We illustrate the method implementation in two different software projects that containspeech interfaces.,International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction,2007,4

The design of an authoring interface to make elearning content accessible,Silvia Gabrielli; Valeria Mirabella; Massimiliano Teso; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract This paper presents the rationale and design process of an authoring interface thatenables didactic experts to create or modify eLearning content to make it accessible bylearners with special needs. The tool has been designed according to a methodologicalframework and a set of guidelines for eLearning accessibility previously developed by ourgroup. A key aspect of our framework consists in helping authors to preserve the didacticquality of the eLearning experiences provided to disabled learners (in particular; visuallyimpaired ones) beyond assuring their mere physical access to online materials. A user-centred design process has been adopted to develop a usable prototype of the authoringinterface; named aLearning; that we describe below.,IFIP Conference on Human-Computer Interaction,2005,4
Exploiting multiple views to support visual exploration and mining,Enrico Bertini; Tiziana Catarci; Stephen Kimani; Giuseppe Santucci,It is no exaggeration that the quantity and complexity of data still present a formidablechallenge to the effective and efficient acquisition of knowledge. On the other hand; resultsobtained from the application of mining techniques are often in a form that is difficult to beunderstood by humans who are accustomed to perceiving information through the visualchannel. Multiple views present a special opportunity that can be leveraged in order toaddress such challenges and visually support the entire exploration and mining process.This paper acknowledges that special visual opportunity by describing how our visual datamining system; VidaMine; exploits multiple views in supporting the user in the explorationand mining process.,Coordinated and Multiple Views in Exploratory Visualization; 2004.

Querying multiple databases dynamically on the world wide web,John Cardiff; Tiziana Catarci; M Passeri; Giuseppe Santucci,The management and retrieval of Web data has received significant attention. Among thevarious approaches; systems have been proposed whose main goal is to provide aframework to integrate different and heterogeneous information sources into a commondomain model. The Web-At-A-Glance (WAG) system falls into this category; its keycharacteristic being that instead of requiring an explicit description of the sources; it attemptsto semi-automatically classify the information gathered from various sites based on theconceptual model of the domain of interest. The initial WAG prototype dealt exclusively with"standard" Web pages; which typically are HTML or XML documents and present non-or semi-structured information; and they vary widely in their means of presenting information to theuser. We present the extension of the WAG system to deal with form pages. In particular …,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2000. Proceedings of the First International Conference on,2000,4

A Graphical Notebook as Interaction Metaphor for Querying Databases.,Sonia Fernandes Silva; Tiziana Catarci; Ulrich Schiel,Abstract Recent database applications are typically oriented towards a large set ofnonexpert users; and therefore; they need to be equipped with suitable interfaces facilitatingthe interaction with the system. Within this context; we propose the design andimplementation of a new user-oriented visual query system; called TVQE; that supports adiagrammatic representation of the database schema including historical classes andrelationships and a graphical notebook" as interaction metaphor in order to provide a moreintuitive form of expressing conventional and historical queries. Hence; users are releasedfrom syntactical di culties which are typical of textual query languages.

Accessing the Web: Exploiting the Data Base Paradigm,Tiziana Catarci; Luca Iocchi; Daniele Nardi; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract: The open growth of the Internet; the amount of available information; and thetypical access modality (ie; browsing) cause the puzzled user to search for the information ofinterest in a labyrinth of links. Web-at-a-Glance (WAG) is a system aiming to allow the user toquery (instead of browsing) the Web. The basic idea is to build; once the user has specifieda generic domain of interest; the domain conceptual representation; to instantiate it with dataextracted from Web sites (so to build a materialized view over the Web); and to query such aconceptual representation through an easy-to-use visual interface. Knowledgerepresentation techniques are used for both the internal modeling of the conceptualrepresentation and for supporting the automatic extraction of data from Web sites to feed thematerialized view.,INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOP ON BUILDING; MANTAINING AND USING ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORIES,1998,4

On Expressing Stratified Datalog.,Tiziana Catarci; Isabel F Cruz,We consider the broad class of strati ed Datalog queries (which includes both linear andnon-linear queries) and propose an extended closure operator that expresses such queries whenadded to the relational algebra. We show that there exists a canonical form for strati ed Datalogqueries; and that suitable hypergraphs can be used to express them. We anticipate the use ofsuch hypergraphs in identifying special classes of strati ed Datalog queries and in devising ecient algorithms for these classes; and outline the use of the visual representation of hypergraphsin a user interface for querying databases … The study of query languages that are more expressivethan rst order query languages has been the subject of much research; since the early resultsin [AU79] concerning the inability of rst order queries to express the transitive closure of a binaryrelation.

Human-computer interaction view on information retrieval evaluation,Tiziana Catarci; Stephen Kimani,Abstract The field of information retrieval (IR) has experienced tremendous growth over theyears. Researchers have however identified Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aspects asimportant concerns in IR research. Incorporation of HCI techniques in IR can ensure that IRsystems intended for human users are developed and evaluated in a way that is consistentwith and reflects the needs of those users. The traditional methods of evaluating IR systemshave for a long period been largely concerned with system-oriented measurements such asprecision and recall; but not on the usability aspects of the IR system. There also are no well-established evaluation approaches for studying users and their interactions with IR systems.This chapter describes the role and place of HCI toward supporting and appropriating theevaluation of IR systems.,*,2013,3

An ontology-based query manager: Usability evaluation,Tiziana Catarci; Tania Di Mascio; Paolo Dongilli; Enrico Franconi; Giuseppe Santucci; Sergio Tessaris,Abstract. In this paper; we describe the usability evaluation experiments of an ontology-based Query manager; which is part of the SEW ASIE system (SEmantic Webs and Agentsin Integrated Economies). The usability evaluation is an important step of the User-CenteredDesign Methodology; followed to develop the entire project that aims at enabling a uniformaccess to heterogeneous data sources through an integrated ontology. The Query Managerallows the user to construct the query by a diagrammatic interface generating precise andunambiguous query expressions. The main goal of our experiment is to demonstrate theease of use of the Query Manager independently of the domain user expertise. This studyconfirms that the Query Manager is usable as for the end-users (domain-expert users) as forthe nondomain expert users.,HCItaly2005 [16],2005,3

Smartdate: User Adaptation in Location-based Mobile matchmaking,M Berghell; Andrea Capata; Tiziana Catarci; Paolo Cerrocchi; Paolo Masi; Marco Oppedisano; Amiliano Trevisani; Andrea Vitaletti; Andrea Calì,Abstract. The problem of matching user profiles arises in several applications wheredemand and supply profiles need to be matched; eg; in information systems for recruitment;real estate; or dating agencies. In this paper we present SmartDate; a system that matchesprofiles of users that need to be matched for dating. The system runs on mobile devices andoperates in multichannel mode; the matches take into account the location of the user at thetime he/she issues a query. The matchmaking technique implemented in our system usesrigorous logic formalisms and is based on formal reasoning tasks. Since the best results arepresented to the user at each query issued to the system; the technique allows for a user-based adaptation of the interface offered by the system; thus making possible anoptimization of the small screen space available in mobile devices.,International Workshop on Plastic Services for Mobile Devices; Rome; Italy,2005,3

Distributed Semantic Query Processing in a Cooperative Information System.,John Cardiff; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract Visual Query System (VQS) is a suitable interface to a cooperative informationsystem; as its users often have no knowledge of the structure or location of the data.However queries issued through a VQS may be translated into inefficient queries to thecomponent systems; if the semantics of the system are not considered. In this paper; wepresent the design of a semantic query preprocessor for a cooperative information system.We also introduce a logic language to formally express interdependencies between classesbelonging to different schemas. Using these assertions; we may benefit in several ways fromthe possibility of reasoning about them; including applying them in heterogeneous queryprocessing.,CoopIS,1995,3
Structure modeling hypergraphs: a complete representation for databases,Tiziana Catarci; Laura Tarantino,Abstract The advent of low-cost high-resolution graphical workstations led to a newgeneration of interaction tools (often called Visual Languages) in information systems;where the use of graphics enhances the quality of the interaction. Unfortunately; in contrastto traditional (textual) query languages; no general framework exists where any visuallanguage can be formally represented to evaluate its expressive power. Hypergraphsappear good candidates for being a very natural mathematical counterpart of arbitrarilycomplex visual structures. In this paper we present a particular kind of hypergraph; theStructure Modeling Hypergraph; as a representation tool able to capture the basic featuresof existing data models and well fit to define a set of basic graphical interaction primitives; interms of which more complex interaction mechanisms may be described and compared.,*,1992,3

Using a high level formal language for task model-based usability evaluation,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Yael Dubinsky; Tiziana Catarci; Eli Nazarov; Assaf Israel,Abstract Evaluating usability is a challenge in many development projects. We propose aformal high-level task modeling language; called TaMoGolog; to define task model-basedusability evaluation. TaMoGolog provides a well-defined syntax and semantics; enablesprecondition axioms of tasks; states postcondition effects to variables due to tasks execution;provides a rich set of operators for constructing task models of complex system behavior inan accurate and unambiguous form; and gives the facility to express domain knowledge inresulting task models. We suggest a framework to use TaMoGolog and describe the life-cycle for evaluating the usability of software products through formal task models. We furtherpresent a tool; called TaMUlator; to manage and automate the proposed evaluation life-cycle at the integrated development environment (IDE) level.,*,2012,2

A survey of context-aware cross-digital library personalization,Ana Nika; Tiziana Catarci; Yannis Ioannidis; Akrivi Katifori; Georgia Koutrika; Natalia Manola; Andreas Nürnberger; Manfred Thaller,Abstract The constant interaction of users with different Digital Libraries (DLs) and thesubsequent scattering of user information across them raise the need not only for DigitalLibrary interoperability but also for cross-Digital Library personalization. The latter calls forsharing and combining of user-information across different DL systems so that a DL systemmay take advantage of data from others. To achieve this goal; DL systems should be able tomaintain compliant and interoperable user models and profiles that enable propagation andreconciliation of user information across different DLs. In this paper; we motivate the need forcross-Digital Library personalization; we define and examine user model; profile; andcontext interoperability; and we survey and discuss existing user model interoperabilityapproaches.,International Workshop on Adaptive Multimedia Retrieval,2010,2

Peer-to-peer data quality improvement in the daquincis system,Diego Milano; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci,ABSTRACT: Data quality improvement is becoming an increasingly important issue. Incontexts where data are replicated among different sources; data quality improvement ispossible through extensive data comparisons: whereas copies of same data are differentbecause of data errors; comparisons help to reconcile such copies. Record matchingalgorithms can support the task of linking different copies of the same data in order toengage reconciliation activities; for instance; a periodical running of record matchingalgorithms can be performed in order to reconcile copies with different quality. Nevertheless;the extensive running of such algorithms is typically performed in fixed instants. This allowsfor periods in which the quality of data can deteriorate; while no quality improvement actionis performed on data.

DARE: a multidimensional environment for visualizing large set of medical data,Giuseppe Santucci; Tiziana Catarci,We deal with the problem of automatic visualization of a large set of medical data andpropose a framework that addresses the involved issues. Our approach does not depend onthe particular data under analysis and its aim is to produce a highly effective visualrepresentation. Such objective is made possible by the consistency of a set of logic rulescontained in a knowledge base. These rules express facts and relationships about the visualdomain; the data domain; the mapping between both domains; and the perceptual domain.Our approach has been tested against a challenging set of data; ie; the biomedical datacoming from the Nefrology Center of the Civil hospital of Vigevano.,Information Visualisation; 2002.

A Visual Data Mining Environment,Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract. It cannot be overstated that the knowledge discovery process still presentsformidable challenges. One of the main issues in knowledge discovery is the need for anoverall framework that can support the entire discovery process. It is worth noting the roleand place of visualization in such a framework. Visualization enables or triggers the user touse his/her outstanding visual and mental capabilities; thereby gaining insight andunderstanding of data. The foregoing points to the pivotal role that visualization can play insupporting the user throughout the entire discovery process.

Databases and the Web: new requirements for an easy access,Tiziana Catarci,The need for friendly environments for effective information access has been enforced by thegrowth of the Internet; which is causing a dramatic change in both the kind of people whoaccess the information (in the near future everybody will interact with computers in everydaylife) and the types of information itself (ranging from unstructured multimedia data totraditional record-oriented data). To cope with these new demands; the interactiontechniques traditionally offered to DBMS users have to evolve and eventually integrate in apowerful interface to the global information infrastructure. The new interaction mechanismsmust be especially friendly and easy to use since; given the enormous quantity ofinformation sources available on the Internet; most users remain permanent novices withrespect to each one of the sources they have access to.[FN 1]In particular; there is a need …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,2

Enabling Symbiotic Autonomy in Short-Term Interactions: A User Study,Francesco Riccio; Andrea Vanzo; Valeria Mirabella; Tiziana Catarci; Daniele Nardi,Abstract The presence of robots in everyday environments is increasing day by day; andtheir deployment spans over various applications: industrial and working scenarios; healthcare assistance in public areas or at home. However; robots are not yet comparable tohumans in terms of capabilities; hence; in the so-called Symbiotic Autonomy; robots andhumans help each other to complete tasks. Therefore; it is interesting to identify the factorsthat allow to maximize human-robot collaboration; which is a new point of view with respectto the HRI literature and very much leaning toward a social behavior. In this work; weanalyze a subset of such variables as possible influencing factors of humans' CollaborationAttitude in a Symbiotic Autonomy framework; namely: Proxemics setting; Activity Context;and Gender and Height as valuable features of the users.

A petri-net based approach to measure the learnability of interactive systems,Obaida Hanteer; Andrea Marrella; Massimo Mecella; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract We propose an approach to measure the learnability of an interactive system. Ourapproach relies on recording in a user log all the user actions that take place during a run ofthe system and on replaying them over one or more interaction models of the system. Eachinteraction model describes the expected way of executing a relevant task provided by thesystem. The proposed approach is able to identify deviations between the interactionmodels and the user log and to assess the weight of such deviations through a fitness value;which estimates how much a log adheres to the models. Our thesis is that by measuring therate of such a fitness value for subsequent executions of the system we can not onlyunderstand if the system is learnable with respect to its relevant tasks; but also to identifypotential learning issues.,Proceedings of the International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,2016,1
ViZCom: Viewing; Zooming and Commenting through Mobile Devices,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Mahmoud Sharf; Ragaad AlTarawneh; Achim Ebert; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract In tabletop-supported collaborative environments; direct viewing or accessing to allparts of the screen is not possible in many cases. This could affect the performance of teammembers in executing the common collaborative tasks. Targeting this concern; wedeveloped the ViZCom (Viewing; Zooming and Commenting) framework that enables theteam members to view the tabletop screen on their mobile devices. It also facilitates them tozoom the screen view on their mobile devices through different zooming options. Further; itprovides the facility to write comments or highlight screen parts on their mobile devices;which are then scaled proportionally and shown on the actual tabletop. Overall; theframework extends the collaborative environment by adding these mobile devices in order toprovide more spatial flexibility.,Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Interactive Tabletops & Surfaces,2015,1

First international workshop on usability and accessibility focused requirements engineering (UsARE 2012): summary report,Tiziana Catarci; Anna Perini; Norbert Seyff; Shah Rukh Humayoun; Nauman Ahmed Qureshi,Abstract Usability and accessibility issues are common causes why software fails to meetuser requirements. However; requirements engineers still focus on functional requirementsand might ignore to also elicit system usability and accessibility requirements. This is a highrisk which can lead to project and software failure. Improving the usability and accessibilityof a system in a later development stage is costly and time consuming. Targeting theseconcerns; the workshop envisioned that research must address the proper integration ofsystem usability and accessibility requirements into the requirements engineering processand also must focus on how to manage and control the evaluation of these requirements in asystematic way.

A visual data mining environment,Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract It cannot be overstated that the knowledge discovery process still presentsformidable challenges. One of the main issues in knowledge discovery is the need for anoverall framework that can support the entire discovery process. It is worth noting the roleand place of visualization in such a framework. Visualization enables or triggers the user touse his/her outstanding visual and mental capabilities; thereby gaining insight andunderstanding of data. The foregoing points to the pivotal role that visualization can play insupporting the user throughout the entire discovery process. The work reported in thischapter is part of a project aiming at developing an open data mining system with a visualinteraction environment that supports the user in the entire process of mining knowledge.,*,2008,1
Managing user-centred design in agile projects,Yael Dubinsky; Tiziana Catarci; Shah Rukh Humayoun; Stephen Kimani,Our experience with agile and non-agile software teams in the industry shows low levels ofUser-Centered Design (UCD) management. We define UCD management for a specificsoftware project as the ability to steer and control the UCD activities within the developmentenvironment of this project. By low levels of UCD management we mean that usually usersare not involved in the process of development and if involved there is no implicitly impact inthe Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is used. Since 2002 the first author isguiding the implementation of the agile approach in both the industry and the academia[Talby et al; 2006; Dubinsky and Hazzan 2005].

Appropriating heuristic evaluation methods for mobile computing,Alan Dix; E Bertini; T Catarci; S Gabrielli; S Kimani; G Santucci,Heuristic evaluation has proven popular for desktop and web interfaces; both in practicaldesign and as a research topic. Compared to full user studies; heuristic evaluation can behighly cost-effective; allowing a large proportion of usability flaws to be detected ahead offull development with limited resource investment. Mobile computing shares many usabilityissues with more conventional interfaces. However; it also poses particular problems forusability evaluation related to aspects such as limited screen real estate; intermittent userattention; and contextual factors. This chapter describes a modified collection of usabilityheuristics that are designed to be appropriate for evaluation in mobile computing. They havebeen systematically derived from extensive literature and empirically validated. Theytherefore offer a sound basis for heuristic-based evaluation in mobile computing. Besides …,*,2007,1
Active data and the digital library shell,Yael Dubinsky; Tiziana Catarci; Stephen Kimani,ABSTRACT Digital Libraries (DL) have emerged rapidly in the last decade with respect toorganizing data and providing the abilities of access and search within the data. Using DLinterfaces; users are mainly involved with “search” and “search refinement” activities. Wesuggest that this approach should be extended in order to fit the users in their real world.Beyond access and search which we consider as activities which are data-passive; meaningthe data is provided by the DL only; users need to have the ability to construct their own datathat is based on current and previous ones. In this paper; we describe a comprehensive DLshell that supports the users with a new kind of activities in order to develop their own datanamed active data.

Managing Personal Data with an Ontology.,Vivi Katifori; Antonella Poggi; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci; Yannis E Ioannidis,Abstract—Nowadays; our personal computer contains a huge amount of information; that isstored in several different formats. When looking for an information; one possibility is to usea keyword-based search tool. However; this kind of tool has several well-known limitations.In this paper we propose a framework for Personal Information Management; calledOntoPIM; that relies on the use of a Personal Ontology; to assign a semantics to theinformation contained in the user desktop; as well as to query the system. In particular; bythe use of the Semantic Save; it provides the user the possibility to store any object ofinterest according to its semantics; ie to relate it to the concepts of the Personal Ontology;where an object may be a mail; a document; a picture; or any other type of data. Then; theuser is given the possibility to query the Personal Ontology; whereas the system carries …,IRCDL,2006,1

Recourse for guiding didactical creators in the development of accessible e-learning material,Valeria Mirabella; Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract Most of the existing efforts for supporting the preparation and delivery of accessiblee-learning materials propose guidelines that prevalently ad-dress technical accessibilityissues. However; little or no consideration is given to the didactical creators in the learningmaterial preparation. The existing guidelines also usually provide generic indications onalternative forms of didactical content to enable equivalent access of the content. However;the sole provision of equivalent forms does not guarantee effective access. While this paperacknowledges the role of the existing guidelines; it proposes that the didactical domaincreators be provided with a non-technical recourse that can enable them to contribute to orparticipate in the development process of accessible e-learning content aiming atguaranteeing an effective learning experience.,Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Human Interaction,2004,1

The process of converting documents in digital forms is fundamental for officeautomation; and is continually becoming a more and more powerful tool in those fieldswhere information still comes from hybrid sources (papers; books; files; etc); eg; in digitallibraries. In this paper we present the jdan (Java-based environment for DocumentApplications on Networks) framework; that; on the basis of a component architecture; is ableto manage both document images and forms. We argue that jdan could be a starting pointfor developing more complex architectures for digital libraries; as it is based on XMLtechnologies and has a good modularization that allows its integration in both ServiceandGrid-based scenarios.,DELOS Workshop: Digital Library Architectures,2004,1
Data quality improvement in the daquincis system,Luca De Santis; Diego Milano; Gabriele Palmieri; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci,Data quality improvement is becoming an increasingly important issue. In contexts wheredata are replicated among different sources; data quality improvement is possible throughextensive data comparisons: whereas copies of same data are different because of dataerrors; comparisons help to reconcile such copies. Best quality copies can be selected orconstructed in order to correct other copies. Record matching algorithms can support thetask of linking different copies of the same data in order to engage reconciliation activities;for instance; a periodical running of record matching algorithms can be performed in order toreconcile copies with different quality. Nevertheless; the extensive running of suchalgorithms is typically performed in fixed instants. This allows for periods in which the qualityof data can deteriorate; while no quality improvement action is performed on data. In this …,*,2004,1

Visual Query Interfaces,Tiziana Catarci; Massimo Mecella; Stephen Kimani; Giuseppe Santucci,Summary A Visual Query System (VQS) can be defined as a system that uses a visualrepresentation for both the domain of interest and requests related to the domain. Inparticular; as the purpose of any VQS is to provide access to the information contained in adatabase; the main users' tasks are understanding the database content; focusing onmeaningful items; finding query patterns; and reasoning on the query result. The firstgraphical query language which was referred to as Query-By-Example was introduced in themid-1970s; and a wide range of implementations were built using these concepts and thereare several tools using this paradigm today.

A Boosting Approach to eContent Development for Learners with Special Needs,Valeria Mirabella; Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci; Silvia Gabrielli,Of late there has been a growing interest and effort toward meeting the requirements ofpersons with special needs. However; most of the accessibility standards and guidelinesthat have been proposed have been developed by adopting a domain independent andoften 'technical'perspective. Such proposals are therefore often not sufficient to achieveaccessibility goals in specific application areas such as eLearning. This paper presents aboosting approach/framework toward the development of more effective and usableaccessibility indications for authors of didactic content; which are currently being fed andtested within the Italian context of the VICE project. This approach is intended to take intoaccount the aforementioned issue and to make a step forward with respect to existingaccessibility proposals and approaches in the eLearning domain.

Diagrammatic Vs Textual Query Languages: A Comparative,T Catarci; G Santucci,Abstract The significance of usability as one of the most important system characteristics iswidely recognized in all the application fields; including databases. This also implies theinvolvement of the user in the activities of design and testing of any interface. However; veryfew studies aiming at validating the usability of a system have been proposed in thedatabase field; in contrast to many other computer science areas. In this paper we presentan experiment comparing; from the point of view of the ease-of-use; a novel visual querylanguage; namely QBD*; against a well-known traditional textual language such as SQL.The results of the experiment confirmed the superiority of the QBD* approach; which isbased on a conceptual data model; closer to the user view of the reality than the relationalmodel; a visual representation of such a model; more attractive and graspable than a …,Visual Database Systems 3: Visual information management,2013,*
Data in Usability Experiments,Sónia Fernandes Silva; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract In most recent Visual Query Systems (WQSs); there is the attempt to address thedifferent needs of various classes of users by developing adaptive interfaces having afundamental component in the user model module. Within this context; we argue that thetemporal issues are a key factor in modeling th user's interaction; and also in carrying outrelated usability analysis on VQSs. Hence; we propose a uniform framework for modelingand manipulating several kinds of time-based information related with VQSs; which exploitsa graph-based formalism; equipped with visual temporal operators. In this paper; weconcentrate on the time-based information which are derived from usability experiments. Inparticular; we show that the history of the user's interaction can be accessed anddynamically maintained by using such visual temporal operators.

On Probabilistic Record Linkage: New Methods Compared to the Fellegi-Sunter Approac.,Diego Zardetto; Monica Scannapieco; Luca Valentino; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract. Record Linkage (RL) aims at identifying pairs of records coming from differentsources and representing the same real world entity. Several methods have been proposedto face RL problems and many independent software implementations of traditional methodsexist. However; none of the available systems seems to be at the same time fully automatedand very effective. In this paper we describe and test a new RL software that; instead;possesses both these abilities: the MAERLIN system. MAERLIN implements a novel suite ofmethods for RL; based on Mixture Models. Such methods allow our system to obtainaccurate and reliable results without relying on domain knowledge; thus not jeopardizingautomation. The system adopts a two-component Beta mixture model and finds MaximumLikelihood estimates of mixture parameters by means of an original Perturbative Fitting …,SEBD,2011,*

Modeling Users and Context in Digital Libraries: Interoperability Issues,Ana Nika; Tiziana Catarci; Akrivi Katifori; Georgia Koutrika; Natalia Manola; Andreas Nürnberger; Manfred Thaller,Abstract. The modeling of user characteristics is an important mechanism for the support andenhancement of personalization in Digital Libraries (DLs). Contextual information issometimes considered in the literature as part of the user model; although it in factinfluences user-DL interaction. However; context modeling and user modeling are stronglyinterrelated. Similar methods are employed for the representation of user context and usermodel and the use of ontologies constitutes a promising approach for such a representationbecause they facilitate the sharing of information and reinforce interoperability. In this paper;we define the user model and user context for Digital Libraries; we examine identifiedcontext dimensions as well as context-independent and contextdependent user modelattributes; and we propose a Shareable User and Context Model Ontology (SUCMO) for …,Proc. of the 2nd DL. org Workshop in conjunction with the 14th European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL 2010); Glasgow; Scotland,2010,*

appropriating Heuristic evaluation for Mobile Computing,T Catarci; S Gabrielli; G Santucci,Heuristic evaluation has proven popular for desktop and web interfaces; both in practicaldesign and as a research topic. Compared to full user studies; heuristic evaluation can behighly cost-effective; allowing a large proportion of usability flaws to be detected ahead offull development with limited resource investment. Mobile computing shares many usabilityissues with more conventional interfaces. However; it also poses particular problems forusability evaluation related to aspects such as limited screen real estate; intermittent userattention; and contextual factors. This article describes a modified collection of usabilityheuristics that are designed to be appropriate for evaluation in mobile computing. They havebeen systematically derived from extensive literature and empirically validated. Theytherefore offer a sound basis for heuristic-based evaluation in mobile computing. Besides …,*,2009,*

Advances in Data and Service Integration,Tiziana Catarci; Hervé Panetto; Monica Scannapieco,The problem of how to provide transparent access to heterogeneous information sourceswhile maintaining their autonomy already appeared decades ago and has been addressedby data integration techniques. Those techniques enable the interaction between clients anddata sources through a centralized access point; and uniform query interfaces that giveusers the illusion of querying a homogeneous system. However; they work under certainhypotheses; including moderately static scenarios; shared understanding of the domain ofinterest (in the form of a global schema or ontology); and a closed; or at least access-controlled; set of participating sources. All these hypotheses do not hold anymore in thecurrent web comprising millions of autonomous peers; having no centralized control.

A formal specification facilitates the description of the systemproperties without being concerned about implementation details and enables the detectionof fundamental design issues before they manifest themselves in the implementation. Invisual data mining; a formal specification can enable users to decide whichinteraction/operation to apply to get a desired result; help users to predict the results of theirinteractions/operations with the system; and enable the development of a general interactionmodel that designers/developers can use to understand the relationships between userinteractions and their compositions.

Contrary to the annotation-based approach; whereinformation manually attached to the data objects if used for retrieval; in content-basedretrieval; automatically derived meta-data is used. However; the quality of the meta data iscrucial; and often; it a priori is not clear which meta data is best suited to execute a user-issued query.

Managing Data Quality in Cooperative Information systems,Tiziana Catarci Baldoni; Carlo Batini,Abstract. Current approaches to the development of cooperative information systems arebased on services to be offered by cooperating organizations; and on the opportunity ofbuilding coordinators and brokers on top of such services. The quality of data exchangedand provided by different services hampers such approaches; as data of low quality canspread all over the cooperative system. At the same time; improvement can be based oncomparing data; correcting them and disseminating high quality data. In this paper; a service-based framework for managing data quality in cooperative information systems is presented.An XML-based model for data and quality data is proposed; and the design of a broker fordata; which selects the best available data from different services; is presented. Such abroker also supports the improvement of data based on feedbacks to source services.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2003,*

Categorizing Pages on the Web: The WAG Page Classi er,Giuseppe Santucci; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract The WWW masks under its apparent ease-of-use; the di culties intrinsically relatedwith the need of\searching"; without any real help; the information of interest. In order toovercome such di culties; various approaches have been recently proposed. Among them;there is Web-at-A-Glance (WAG); a system based on the idea of allowing the user to ask forthe information of interest; instead of searching for locating them. In order to achieve this; thesystem semi-automatically gleans the most relevant information from a Web site or severalWeb sites; stores them into a database cooperatively designed with the user; and allowsher/him to query such a database through a friendly visual interface. In this paper we presentone of the core modules of WAG; namely the Page Classi er.

INFORMATION SERVICES: COPING WITH THE INFORMATION CRISIS GUEST EDITORS'INTRODUCTION,Avigdor Gal; John Mylopoulos,Information plays a critical role in the information age due to its importance in fulfilling thegoals of individuals and organizations alike. In order to ensure effective decision making;information should be of high quality; ie relevant; complete; accurate; timely; etc. Thesequalities can be achieved; at least in theory; through suitable preprocessing and filtering ofpossibly vast amount of data. However; the distributed; heterogeneous; and autonomousnature of information sources poses severe technical challenges for any technology thatattempts to provide coherent and compact information. In particular; information needs to begathered and filtered from a large; open and changing network of information sources.Moreover; these sources were developed independently; may be based on a variety ofinformation models; and may contain duplicate or even contradictory information.

A Visual Approach to Multilinear Recursion,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract The problem of expressing complex queries in a friendly way is particularly relevantdue to the growing diffusion of databases. However; the most significant proposals forextending the expressive power of the relational query languages are based on the logicalparadigm. In particular; an extension of the Horn clause queries; ie the so-called stratifiedDatalog; yields stratified queries; that are a proper subset of fixpoint queries. It is a generalopinion that logic is not a friendly interfacing medium for a casual user. As a consequence;other types of query languages; ie visual query languages; have been proposed; some ofthem having an expressive power higher than the relational algebra. Up to now; no visualquery language has been proved to provide the expressive power of stratified Datalog. Inthis paper; we present QBD**; a visual query language; and show that it is able to express …,*,1995,*

GRASP: A Complete Graphical Conceptual Language for Definition and Manipulation of Statistical Databases,T Catarci; G Santucci,Abstract Recent research activities show a growing interest in statistical databases. Suchinterest is motivated by the increasing number of statistical applications and theinadequacies of traditional database languages and interfaces for statistical applications. Anoutstanding open problem in statistical database development is how to express aggregatedata starting from a description of elementary data. We propose a solution to this problem bymeans of a new language; called GRASP (GRA phical Statistical Package). The languageallows to query uniformly both elementary and aggregate data; and is; therefore; suitable forseveral different purposes: a) posing queries on elementary data; b) building aggregate datafrom elementary data; c) computing new aggregate data using statistical operators.,*,1988,*

Semantic Query Processing in a Heterogeneous Database Environment,John Cardiff; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract Semantic query optimization is the process of transforming a query issued by a userinto a different query which; because of the semantics of the application; is guaranteed toyield the correct answer for all states of the database. While this process has beensuccessfully applied in centralised databases; its potential for distributed andheterogeneous systems is enormous; as there is the potential to eliminate inter-site joinswhich are the single biggest cost factor in query processing. Further justification for its use isprovided by the fact that users of heterogeneous databases typically issue queries throughhigh-level languages which may result in very inefficient queries if mapped directly; withoutconsideration of the semantics of the system. Even if this is not the case; users cannot beexpected to be familiar with the semantics of the component databases; and may …,*,*,*
Chatbots as a Novel Access Method for Government Open Data⋆,Simone Porreca; Francesco Leotta; Massimo Mecella; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract. In this discussion paper; we propose to employ chatbots as a user-friendly interfacefor open data published by organizations; specifically focusing on public administrations.Open data are especially useful in e-Government initiatives but their exploitation is currentlyhampered to end users by the lack of user-friendly access methods. On the other hand;current UX in social networks have made people used to chatting. Building on cognitivetechnologies; we prototyped a chatbot on top of the OpenCantieri dataset published by theItalian Ministero delle Infrastrutture e Trasporti; and we argue that such a model can beextended as a generally available access method to open data.,*,*,*

Supporting cognitive walkthrough with video data: a mobile learning evaluation study,T Catarci; S Kimani; S Gabrielli,Although expert-based evaluation techniques such as heuristic evaluation and cognitivewalkthrough are often inexpensive and quick to apply; they have not proved to be effective incapturing contextual factors that arise in real-world settings. It is no trivial issue tounderstand how such evaluation techniques could be modified or differently applied so as tobetter take into account context; without loosing the advantages inherent in thosetechniques. This paper explores a possible way of addressing the trade-off betweenapplication of cognitive walkthrough and low cost improvements of its contextual validity. Inparticular; we propose and investigate the benefits of supporting cognitive walkthrough withvideo data about user interaction with an eLearning course on mobile device. Initial resultsfrom this study indicated that video data provided evaluators with a more detailed …,*,*,*

Querying Multiple Databases Dynamically,J Cardiff; T Catarci; M Passeri; G Santucci,Abstract The management and retrieval of Web data has recently received significantattention. Among the various approaches; systems have been proposed whose main goal isto provide a framework to integrate different and heterogeneous information sources into acommon domain model. The Web-At-A-Glance (WAG) system falls into this category; its keycharacteristic being that instead of requiring an explicit description of the sources; it attemptsto semi-automatically classify the information gathered from various sites based on theconceptual model of the domain of interest. The initial WAG prototype dealt exclusively with“standard” Web pages; which typically are HTML or XML documents and present non-orsemi-structured information; and they vary widely in their means of presenting information tothe user. In this paper; we present the extension of the WAG system to deal with form …,*,*,*

Interfaces to Databases (IDS-3),Albert N Badre; Tiziana Catarci; Antonio Massari; Giuseppe Santucci,Abstract The importance of designing query systems which are effective and easy to use hasbeen widely recognized in the database area. Also; it is well known that the adequacy of asystem should be tested against actual users in a well monitored experiment. However; veryfew such experiments have been conducted. The objective of our study is to measure andunderstand the comparative ease with which subjects can construct queries in two kinds ofvisual languages; one diagrammatic and the other iconic. More specifically; we areinterested in determining if there is significant interaction between: 1) the query class andthe query language type; and 2) the type of query language and the experience of the user.Experimental results indicate that the effectiveness of a diagrammatic or an iconic querylanguage varies depending on the classes of queries and the kinds of users.

Emergent Semantics and Cooperation in Open Systems,Tiziana Catarci,Information systems of every organization (ranging from large companies to individualentities) have to handle a variety of information sources; from proprietary ones to informationpublicly available in web services worldwide. Grasping relevant information wherever it maybe and exchanging information with all potential partners has become an essentialchallenge. Basically; information sharing; rather than information processing; is IT's primarygoal in the 21st century. The key point is that now information has to be sharable in an openenvironment; where interacting peers do not necessarily have a common understanding ofthe world at hand; as used to be the case in traditional enterprise information systems. Lackof common background generates the need for explicit guidance in understanding the exactmeaning of the data; ie; their semantics. Data semantics is more and more context-and …,*,*,*
Visual Modeling of Temporal Data in Usability Experiments,Tiziana Catarci,Abstract In most recent Visual Query Systems (VQSs); there is the attempt to address the dierent needs of various classes of users by developing adaptive interfaces having afundamental component in the user model module. Within this context; we argue that thetemporal issues are a key factor in modeling th user's interaction; and also in carrying outrelated usability analysis on VQSs. Hence; we propose a uniform framework for modelingand manipulating several kinds of time-based information related with VQSs; which exploitsa graph-based formalism; equipped with visual temporal operators. In this paper; weconcentrate on the time-based information which are derived from usability experiments. Inparticular; we show that the history of the user's interaction can be accessed anddynamically maintained by using such visual temporal operators. This approach is an e …,*,*,*

The Plinius project1 is part of this goal. In particular; it concentrates onthe archaeological heritage of the Pompei site with a twofold objective. On one side; it aimsat allowing different classes of users to enjoy and exploit the Pompei cultural heritage; byproviding them with a suite of personalised tools; whose features address the differentneeds of the various user classes; ranging from the archaeologist to the casual visitor. Onthe other one; it intends to retrieve and reengineer the outcoming of a previous twenty-yearsold software projects; which stored and catalogued a huge amount of information aboutPompei findings into a legacy system; based on an obsolete hardware architecture.

Designing for Primary Tasks in Mobile Computing,Stephen Kimani; Silvia Gabrielli; Tiziana Catarci,Abstract: Although the traditional desktop computing paradigm has had major successes; weare in a day and age where many good computer and device users are increasing findingthemselves performing their primary/central tasks not in offices and desktops but in the realworld settings. Mobile computing has the potential to make possible in the real world settingwhat would have otherwise been impossible through desktop computing. It is worth bearingin mind however that interaction with the mobile application; though important; is often notthe primary task but rather a supplementary task. A careful study of the nature of tasks inmobile computing can make some requirements in the design and evaluation (development)of mobile applications become evident. This paper proposes and describes mobileapplication design and evaluation considerations emerging from an understanding of the …,Describing Users in Context Perspectives on Human-Work Interaction Design,*,*
VidaMine: User-Centred Development of a Visual Mining Environment,Stephen Kimani; Stefano Lodi; Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; Claudio Sartori,Abstract Tremendous technological breakthroughs have virtually revolutionized the world.One major consequence is that humans are confronted with ever-increasing alreadymassive amounts of data at virtually every turn. Visual data mining (VDM) intends to exploiteffective visual strategies in the entire process of mining knowledge. Though there havebeen many efforts in this area; most of them have paid little attention; if any; to usabilitystudies. While ensuring that a VDM system involves the user in the entire mining process isindeed significant; ensuring that the user is involved in the system development processneeds prior consideration. This work describes how a user-centered approach was adoptedin the development of a VDM system named VidaMine.,*,*,*

A USER-ADAPTIVE SMALL-SCREEN OPTIMIZATION APPROACH FOR SEARCHING BOOKS,Enrico Bertini; Andrea Calì; Silvia Gabrielli; Tiziana Catarci,ABSTRACT In this paper; we describe a user-adaptive system designed to access arepository of books with small screen devices. The purpose is to investigate the idea ofemploying usage data as a source for user interface adaptations; to overcome the lack ofscreen space and limit the need for explicit user input. We present an overview of potentialadaptations; describe the user model and the design of an application for an handhehelddevice; and report on a preliminary expert-based usability study.,*,*,*
Using Multiple Representations for Easing Database Interaction,T Catarci; MF Costabile; A Massari; L Saladini; G Santucci,Abstract We present a prototype system to be used for visually accessing heterogeneousdatabases. The basic idea is to provide the user with several visual representations of dataas well as multiple interaction mechanisms for both querying databases and visualizing thequery results. Since some visual representations better fit certain user classes; the systemadapts to the user's needs by switching to the most appropriate visual representation andinteraction mechanism; according to a suitable user model. The data and queryrepresentations are consistent in every paradigm. Such a notion of consistency stems fromformal basis; ie a twofold data/representation model; namely the Graph Model; and a set ofbasic Graphical Primitives. This formal approach allows the user to switch from oneinteraction paradigm to another; always saving the query state.,*,*,*
