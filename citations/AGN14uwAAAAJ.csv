Diverse RNA viruses elicit the expression of common sets of genes in susceptible Arabidopsis thaliana plants,Steven A Whitham; Sheng Quan; Hur‐Song Chang; Bret Cooper; Bram Estes; Tong Zhu; Xun Wang; Yu‐Ming Hou,Summary Systemic infections of plants by viruses require that viruses modify host cells inorder to facilitate infections. These modifications include induction of host factors required forreplication; propagation and movement; and suppression of host defense responses; whichare likely to be associated with changes in host gene expression. Past studies of the effectsof viral infection on gene expression in susceptible hosts have been limited to only a handfulof genes. To gain broader insight into the responses elicited by viruses in susceptible hosts;high-density oligonucleotide probe microarray technology was used. Arabidopsis leaveswere either mock inoculated or inoculated with cucumber mosaic cucumovirus; oil seed rapetobamovirus; turnip vein clearing tobamovirus; potato virus X potexvirus; or turnip mosaicpotyvirus. Inoculated leaves were collected at 1; 2; 4; and 5 days after inoculation; total …,The Plant Journal,2003,327
CTR1 phosphorylates the central regulator EIN2 to control ethylene hormone signaling from the ER membrane to the nucleus in Arabidopsis,Chuanli Ju; Gyeong Mee Yoon; Jennifer Marie Shemansky; David Y Lin; Z Irene Ying; Jianhong Chang; Wesley M Garrett; Mareike Kessenbrock; Georg Groth; Mark L Tucker; Bret Cooper; Joseph J Kieber; Caren Chang,Abstract The gaseous phytohormone ethylene C 2 H 4 mediates numerous aspects ofgrowth and development. Genetic analysis has identified a number of critical elements inethylene signaling; but how these elements interact biochemically to transduce the signalfrom the ethylene receptor complex at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane totranscription factors in the nucleus is unknown. To close this gap in our understanding of theethylene signaling pathway; the challenge has been to identify the target of theCONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1) Raf-like protein kinase; as well as themolecular events surrounding ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2); an ER membrane-localized Nramp homolog that positively regulates ethylene responses. Here wedemonstrate that CTR1 interacts with and directly phosphorylates the cytosolic C-terminal …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2012,255
A network of rice genes associated with stress response and seed development,Bret Cooper; Joseph D Clarke; Paul Budworth; Joel Kreps; Don Hutchison; Sylvia Park; Sonia Guimil; Molly Dunn; Peter Luginbühl; Cinzia Ellero; Stephen A Goff; Jane Glazebrook,Abstract We used a systematic approach to build a network of genes associated withdevelopmental and stress responses in rice by identifying interaction domains for 200proteins from stressed and developing tissues; by measuring the associated geneexpression changes in different tissues exposed to a variety of environmental; biological;and chemical stress treatments; and by localizing the cognate genes to regions of stress-tolerance trait genetic loci. The integrated data set suggests that similar genes respond toenvironmental cues and stresses; and some may also regulate development. Wedemonstrate that the data can be used to correctly predict gene function in monocots anddicots. As a result; we have identified five genes that contribute to disease resistance inArabidopsis.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2003,231
A defective movement protein of TMV in transgenic plants confers resistance to multipleviruses whereas the functional analog increases susceptibility,Bret Cooper; Moshe Lapidot; James A Heick; J Allan Dodds; Roger N Beachy,Abstract Transgenic tobacco plants that express a gene encoding a defective mutant of thetobacco mosaic virus (TMV) movementprotein which are known to be resistant to severaltobamoviruses were inoculated with viruses from different taxonomic groups to determinethe breadth of resistance. There were significant delays in the time of appearance of diseasesymptoms and/or there was reduced systemic accumulation of virus in upper leaves ofplants inoculated with tobacco rattle tobravirus; tobacco ringspot nepovirus; alfalfa mosaicalfamovirus; peanut chlorotic streak caulimovirus; and cucumber mosaic cucumovirus.Conversely; tobacco plants that express a gene encoding the functional tobacco mosaicvirus wild-type movement protein accelerated symptom development; enhanced the severityof symptom formation; and/or increased the accumulation of these viruses and …,Virology,1995,199
Constitutive salicylic acid‐dependent signaling in cpr1 and cpr6 mutants requires PAD4,Dayadevi Jirage; Nan Zhou; Bret Cooper; Joseph D Clarke; Xinnian Dong; Jane Glazebrook,Summary Salicylic acid (SA)-dependent signaling controls activation of a set of plantdefense mechanisms that are important for resistance to a variety of microbial pathogens.Many Arabidopsis mutants that display altered SA-dependent signaling have been isolated.We used double mutant analysis to determine the relative positions of the pad4; cpr1; cpr5;cpr6; dnd1 and dnd2 mutations in the signal transduction network leading to SA-dependentactivation of defense gene expression and disease resistance. The pad4 mutation causesfailure of SA accumulation in response to infection by certain pathogens; while the othermutations cause constitutively high levels of SA; defense gene expression and resistance.The cpr1 pad4; cpr5 pad4; cpr6 pad4; dnd1 pad4 and dnd2 pad4 double mutants wereconstructed and assayed for stature; presence of spontaneous lesions; resistance to …,The Plant Journal,2001,125
Establishment of a protein reference map for soybean root hair cells,Laurent Brechenmacher; Joohyun Lee; Sherri Sachdev; Zhao Song; Tran Hong Nha Nguyen; Trupti Joshi; Nathan Oehrle; Marc Libault; Brian Mooney; Dong Xu; Bret Cooper; Gary Stacey,Root hairs are single tubular cells formed from the differentiation of epidermal cells on roots.They are involved in water and nutrient uptake and represent the infection site onleguminous roots by rhizobia; soil bacteria that establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. Roothairs develop by polar cell expansion or tip growth; a unique mode of plant growth sharedonly with pollen tubes. A more complete characterization of root hair cell biology will lead toa better understanding of tip growth; the rhizobial infection process; and also lead toimprovements in plant water and nutrient uptake. We analyzed the proteome of isolatedsoybean (Glycine max) root hair cells using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and shotgun proteomics (1D-PAGE-liquid chromatography andmultidimensional protein identification technology) approaches.

Investigative proteomics: identification of an unknown plant virus from infected plants using mass spectrometry,Bret Cooper; Donna Eckert; Nancy L Andon; John R Yates III; Paul A Haynes,Abstract We describe the identification of a previously uncharacterized plant virus that iscapable of infecting Nicotiana spp. and Arabidopsis thaliana. Protein extracts were firstprepared from leaf tissue of uninfected tobacco plants; and the proteins were visualized withtwo-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Matching gels were then run using protein extractsof a tobacco plant infected with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). After visual comparison; theproteins spots that were differentially expressed in infected plant tissues were cut from thegels and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(HPLC-MS/MS). Tandem mass spectrometry data of individual peptides was searched withSEQUEST. Using this approach we demonstrated a successful proof-of-concept experimentby identifying TMV proteins present in the total protein extract.

Domains of the TMV movement protein involved in subcellular localization,Theodore W Kahn; Moshe Lapidot; Manfred Heinlein; Christoph Reichel; Bret Cooper; Ron Gafny; Roger N Beachy,Summary To identify and map functionally important regions of the tobacco mosaic virusmovement protein; deletions of three amino acids were introduced at intervals of 10 aminoacids throughout the protein. Mutations located between amino acids 1 and 160 abolishedthe capacity of the protein to transport virus from cell to cell; while some of the mutations inthe C-terminal third of the protein permitted function. Despite extensive tests; no exampleswere found of intermolecular complementation between mutants; suggesting that functionrequires each movement protein molecule to be fully competent. Many of the mutants werefused to green fluorescent protein; and their subcellular localizations were determined byfluorescence microscopy in infected plants and protoplasts. Most mutants lost the ability toaccumulate in one or more of the multiple subcellular sites targeted by wild-type …,The Plant Journal,1998,82
Collateral gene expression changes induced by distinct plant viruses during the hypersensitive resistance reaction in Chenopodium amaranticolor,Bret Cooper,Summary Hypersensitive reactions to plant diseases are typically mediated by R genes.Many R genes that have been cloned only confer resistance to a particular pathogen.However; Chenopodium spp. have multivirus hypersensitive resistance; thus making theunderstanding of this broad-spectrum resistance mechanism attractive. Using tobaccomosaic virus (TMV) tagged with green fluorescent protein to follow infection over time; cDNA-AFLP to find genes up-regulated during virus infection in C. amaranticolor and quantitativeRT–PCR to accurately measure gene expression at different time points; the first dissectionof this significant defense response pathway is presented. The detected disease-expressedsequences in C. amaranticolor (DESCA) are similar to those that encode p450monooxegenases; hypersensitivity-related genes; cellulases; ABC transporters; receptor …,The Plant Journal,2001,66

Probability model for assessing proteins assembled from peptide sequences inferred from tandem mass spectrometry data,Jian Feng; Daniel Q Naiman; Bret Cooper,In shotgun proteomics; tandem mass spectrometry is used to identify peptides derived fromproteins. After the peptides are detected; proteins are reassembled via a reference databaseof protein or gene information. Redundancy and homology between protein records indatabases make it challenging to assign peptides to proteins that may or may not be in anexperimental sample. Here; a probability model is introduced for determining the likelihoodthat peptides are correctly assigned to proteins. This model derives consistent probabilityestimates for assembled proteins. The probability scores make it easier to confidentlyidentify proteins in complex samples and to accurately estimate false-positive rates. Thealgorithm based on this model is robust in creating protein complements from peptides frombovine protein standards; yeast; Ustilago maydis cell lysates; and Arabidopsis thaliana …,Analytical chemistry,2007,61
Proteomic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with ethylene,Ruiqiang Chen; Brad M Binder; Wesley M Garrett; Mark L Tucker; Caren Chang; Bret Cooper,Ethylene (ET) is a volatile hormone that modulates fruit ripening; plant growth; developmentand stress responses. Key components of the ET-signaling pathway identified by geneticdissection in Arabidopsis thaliana include five ET receptors; the negative regulator CTR1and the positive regulator EIN2; all of which localize to the endoplasmic reticulum.Mechanisms of signaling among these proteins are still unresolved and targets of ETresponses are not fully known. So; we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins inmicrosomal membrane preparations from etiolated A. thaliana seedlings maintained inambient air or treated with ET for 3 h. We compared 3814 proteins from ET-exposedseedlings and controls and identified 304 proteins with significant accumulation changes.The proteins with increased accumulation were involved in ET biosynthesis; cell …,Molecular Biosystems,2011,46
Shotgun proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves,Joohyun Lee; Wesley M Garrett; Bret Cooper,Abstract Two shotgun tandem MS proteomics approaches; multidimensional proteinidentification technology (MudPIT) and 1-D gel-LC-MS/MS; were used to identifyArabidopsis thaliana leaf proteins. These methods utilize different protein/peptide separationstrategies. Detergents not compatible with MudPIT were used with 1-D gel-LC-MS/MS tohelp enrich for the detection of membrane-spanning and hydrophobic proteins. Bycombining the data from all MudPIT and 1-D gel-LC-MS/MS experiments; 2342nonredundant proteins spanning a broad range of molecular weights and pI values weredetected. With the exception of unknown proteins; the distribution of gene ontology (GO)classifications for the detected proteins was similar to that encoded by the genome; whichshows that these extraction and separation procedures are useful for a broad proteomic …,Journal of separation science,2007,46
Relative; label-free protein quantitation: spectral counting error statistics from nine replicate MudPIT samples,Bret Cooper; Jian Feng; Wesley M Garrett,Nine replicate samples of peptides from soybean leaves; each spiked with a differentconcentration of bovine apotransferrin peptides; were analyzed on a mass spectrometerusing multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). Proteins were detectedfrom the peptide tandem mass spectra; and the numbers of spectra were statisticallyevaluated for variation between samples. The results corroborate prior knowledge thatcombining spectra from replicate samples increases the number of identifiable proteins andthat a summed spectral count for a protein increases linearly with increasing molar amountsof protein. Furthermore; statistical analysis of spectral counts for proteins in two-and three-way comparisons between replicates and combined replicates revealed little significantvariation arising from run-to-run differences or data-dependent instrument ion sampling …,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,2010,44
Shotgun identification of proteins from uredospores of the bean rust Uromyces appendiculatus,Bret Cooper; Wesley M Garrett; Kimberly B Campbell,Abstract We are interested in learning more about the proteome of Uromycesappendiculatus; the fungus that causes common bean rust. Knowledge of the proteins thatdifferentiate life-cycle stages and distinguish infectious bodies such as uredospores;germlings; appressoria; and haustoria may be used to define host–pathogen interactions orserve as targets for chemical inhibition of the fungus. We have used 2-D nanoflowLC-MS/MSto identify more than 400 proteins from asexual uredospores. A majority of the proteinsappear to have roles in protein folding or protein catabolism. We present a model by whichan abundance of heat shock proteins and translation elongation factors may enhance aspore's ability to survive environmental stresses and rapidly initiate protein production upongermination.,Proteomics,2006,41

Cell-to-cell transport of movement-defective cucumber mosaic and tobacco mosaic viruses in transgenic plants expressing heterologous movement protein genes,BRET COOPER; ISABELLE SCHMITZ; ALN Rao; ROGER N BEACHY; J ALLAN DODDS,Abstract To determine if the movement proteins (MPs) of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus(CMV) and tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) are complementary in function; transgenicplants expressing genes encoding TMV or CMV MP were inoculated with movement-defective mutants of TMV and CMV. Transgenic plants expressing the MP gene of CMVstrain S (subgroup II) complemented the cell-to-cell and systemic spread of a movement-defective mutant of CMV strain Fny (subgroup I) but not the local or systemic spread of amovement-defective mutant of TMV. Plants that contained the MP gene from CMV-S werenot resistant to wild-type TMV infection. When inoculated with a movement-defective mutantof TMV that produced β-glucuronidase; transgenic plants with the CMV MP gene supportedonly subliminal infection.

The haustorial transcriptomes of Uromyces appendiculatus and Phakopsora pachyrhizi and their candidate effector families,Tobias I Link; Patrick Lang; Brian E Scheffler; Mary V Duke; Michelle A Graham; Bret Cooper; Mark L Tucker; Martijn Mortel; Ralf T Voegele; Kurt Mendgen; Thomas J Baum; Steven A Whitham,Summary Haustoria of biotrophic rust fungi are responsible for the uptake of nutrients fromtheir hosts and for the production of secreted proteins; known as effectors; which modulatethe host immune system. The identification of the transcriptome of haustoria and anunderstanding of the functions of expressed genes therefore hold essential keys for theelucidation of fungus–plant interactions and the development of novel fungal controlstrategies. Here; we purified haustoria from infected leaves and used 454 sequencing toexamine the haustorial transcriptomes of Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Uromycesappendiculatus; the causal agents of soybean rust and common bean rust; respectively.These pathogens cause extensive yield losses in their respective legume crop hosts.

Probability-based pattern recognition and statistical framework for randomization: modeling tandem mass spectrum/peptide sequence false match frequencies,Jian Feng; Daniel Q Naiman; Bret Cooper,Abstract Motivation: In proteomics; reverse database searching is used to control the falsematch frequency for tandem mass spectrum/peptide sequence matches; but reversal createssequences devoid of patterns that usually challenge database-search software. Results: Wedesigned an unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm for detecting patterns with variouslengths from large sequence datasets. The patterns found in a protein sequence databasewere used to create decoy databases using a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Searchingthese decoy databases led to the prediction of false positive rates for spectrum/peptidesequence matches. We show examples where this method; independent of instrumentation;database-search software and samples; provides better estimation of false positiveidentification rates than a prevailing reverse database searching method.

Protein accumulation in the germinating Uromyces appendiculatus uredospore,Bret Cooper; Anil Neelam; Kimberly B Campbell; Joohyun Lee; George Liu; Wesley M Garrett; Brian Scheffler; Mark L Tucker,Uromyces appendiculatus is a rust fungus that causes disease on beans. To understandmore about the biology of U. appendiculatus; we have used multidimensional proteinidentification technology to survey proteins in germinating asexual uredospores and havecompared this data with proteins discovered in an inactive spore. The relativeconcentrations of proteins were estimated by counting the numbers of tandem mass spectraassigned to peptides for each detected protein. After germination; there were few changes inamounts of accumulated proteins involved in glycolysis; acetyl Co-A metabolism; citric acidcycle; ATP-coupled proton transport; or gluconeogenesis. Moreover; the total amount oftranslation elongation factors remained high; supporting a prior model that suggests thatgermlings acquire protein translation machinery from uredospores.

The problem with peptide presumption and low Mascot scoring,Bret Cooper,Mascot; a database-search algorithm; is used to deduce an amino acid sequence from apeptide tandem mass spectrum. The magnitude of the Ions score associated with eachpeptide mostly reflects the extent of b− y ion matching in a collision-induced dissociationspectrum. Recently; several studies have reported peptides identified with abnormally lowIons scores. While a majority of the spectra in these studies may be correctly assigned; low-scoring spectra could lack discernible b− y ion fragments needed to clearly delineate apeptide sequence. It appears that low-scoring identification may be predicated primarily onjudgmental parent ion mass accuracy and that justification to include such low-scoringpeptides may be based on inaccurate false discovery rate modeling. It is likely thatadditional scientific experimentation is needed or appropriate methodologies adopted …,Journal of proteome research,2011,33
Generation of Phaseolus vulgaris ESTs and investigation of their regulation upon Uromyces appendiculatus infection,Sandra Thibivilliers; Trupti Joshi; Kimberly B Campbell; Brian Scheffler; Dong Xu; Bret Cooper; Henry T Nguyen; Gary Stacey,Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) is the second most important legume crop in the worldafter soybean. Consequently; yield losses due to fungal infection; like Uromycesappendiculatus (bean rust); have strong consequences. Several resistant genes wereidentified that confer resistance to bean rust infection. However; the downstream genes andmechanisms involved in bean resistance to infection are poorly characterized. A subtractivebean cDNA library composed of 10;581 unisequences was constructed and enriched insequences regulated by either bean rust race 41; a virulent strain; or race 49; an avirulentstrain on cultivar Early Gallatin carrying the resistance gene Ur-4.

Nuclear proteomic changes linked to soybean rust resistance,Bret Cooper; Kimberly B Campbell; Jian Feng; Wesley M Garrett; Reid Frederick,Soybean rust; caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi; is an emerging threat to the USsoybean crop. In an effort to identify proteins that contribute to disease resistance in soybeanwe compared a susceptible Williams 82 cultivar to a resistant Williams 82 inbred isolineharboring the Rpp1 resistance gene (R-gene). Approximately 4975 proteins from nuclearpreparations of leaves were detected using a high-throughput liquid chromatography-massspectrometry method. Many of these proteins have predicted nuclear localization signals;have homology to transcription factors and other nuclear regulatory proteins; and arephosphorylated. Statistics of summed spectral counts revealed sets of proteins withdifferential accumulation changes between susceptible and resistant plants. These proteinaccumulation changes were compared to previously reported gene expression changes …,Molecular BioSystems,2011,31

Mass spectrometry‐based proteomics for the detection of plant pathogens,Neerav D Padliya; Bret Cooper,Abstract Plant diseases caused by fungi; oomycetes; viruses; and bacteria are devastatingboth to the economy and to the food supply of a nation. Therefore; the development of new;rapid methods to identify these pathogens is a highly important area of research that is ofinternational concern. MS-based proteomics has become a powerful and increasinglypopular approach to not only identify these pathogens; but also to better understand theirbiology. However; there is a distinction between identifying a pathogen protein andidentifying a pathogen based upon the detection of one of its proteins and this must beconsidered before the general application of MS for plant pathogen detection is made. Therehas been a recent push in the proteomics community to make data from large-scaleproteomics experiments publicly available in the form of a centralized repository. Such a …,*,2006,29
Identification of rice (Oryza sativa) proteins linked to the cyclin-mediated regulation of the cell cycle,Bret Cooper; Don Hutchison; Sylvia Park; Sonia Guimil; Peter Luginbühl; Cinzia Ellero; Stephen A Goff; Jane Glazebrook,Abstract Yeast two-hybrid assays were used to identify rice proteins interacting with two ricecyclins and other proteins potentially involved in cell cycling. The DNA sequences encoding119 protein fragments identified were then compared by BLAST against proteins inGenBank. The proteins found include myosin-like proteins; transcription factors; kinesins;centromere proteins and undefined proteins. Based on interactions with cyclins and otherelements required for cycling; we believe the undefined proteins may be involved inassociated cycling processes.

Together; efficient separation and MS can lead to theidentification of thousands of proteins in a sample; cell or tissue and help build proteomemaps that can be used to define a cell type or cellular state. Although 2D gels have beensuccessfully used to separate proteins for subsequent MS analysis; alternative separationefficiencies and; consequently deeper results could be obtained with HPLC or otherseparation techniques that improve throughput. This highlight is aimed toward plantscientists who have special separation needs due to the nature of plant cells and who couldbenefit from knowing options and requirements for adopting alternative separation protocols.Through the various sample processing and protein separation strategies; plant biologists …,Molecular bioSystems,2006,24

Defective movement of viruses in the family Bromoviridae is differentially complemented in Nicotiana benthamiana expressing tobamovirus or dianthovirus moveme...,ALN Rao; Bret Cooper; Carl M Deom,ABSTRACT Taxonomically distinct tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV); red clover necroticmosaic dianthovirus (RCNMV); cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV); brome mosaicbromovirus (BMV); and cowpea chlorotic mottle bromovirus (CCMV) exhibit differences intheir host range. Each of these viruses encodes a functionally similar nonstructuralmovement protein (MP) that is essential for cell-to-cell movement of a progeny virus. Despitethe lack of significant amino acid identity among the MPs of CMV; TMV; and RCNMV;movement-defective CMV (CMVFnyΔMP-ΔKPN) was able to move locally and systemicallyin transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana expressing either TMV MP (NB-TMV-MP (+)) orRCNMV MP (NB-RCNMV-MP (+)).

Differences in the subcellular localization of tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus movement proteins in infected and transgenic plants,Bret Cooper; J Allan Dodds,Our study reveals differences in the way that tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and cucumbermosaic virus (CMV) movement proteins (MPs) partition with cellular components separatedinto four fractions from different aged leaves of infected and transgenic plants. Immunoblotanalyses showed that TMV and CMV MPs associated predominantly with components in thecell wall fractions from leaves of transgenic plants. In infected tissue; highest levels of TMVMP were found in the organelle fractions from young and middle-aged leaves whereas mostof the CMV MP was found in the detergent wash of the cell wall fraction. These resultsremained consistent even when plants were doubly infected with TMV and CMV. Theseresults imply that MPs of plant viruses from different taxonomic groups differentiallyassociate with subcellular components and that MP produced by a viral infection is …,Journal of general virology,1995,20
Tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of plant pathogenic fungi and the effects of database composition on protein inferences,Neerav D Padliya; Wesley M Garrett; Kimberly B Campbell; David L Tabb; Bret Cooper,Abstract LC-MS/MS has demonstrated potential for detecting plant pathogens. Unlike PCRor ELISA; LC-MS/MS does not require pathogen-specific reagents for the detection ofpathogen-specific proteins and peptides. However; the MS/MS approach we and othershave explored does require a protein sequence reference database and database-searchsoftware to interpret tandem mass spectra. To evaluate the limitations of databasecomposition on pathogen identification; we analyzed proteins from cultured Ustilago maydis;Phytophthora sojae; Fusarium graminearum; and Rhizoctonia solani by LC-MS/MS. Whenthe search database did not contain sequences for a target pathogen; or containedsequences to related pathogens; target pathogen spectra were reliably matched to proteinsequences from nontarget organisms; giving an illusion that proteins from nontarget …,Proteomics,2007,15

Proof by synthesis of Tobacco mosaic virus,Bret Cooper,Synthetic biology is a discipline that includes making life forms artificially from chemicals.Here; a DNA molecule was enzymatically synthesized in vitro from DNA templates madefrom oligonucleotides representing the text of the first Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) sequenceelucidated in 1982. No infectious DNA molecule of that seminal reference sequence exists;so the goal was to synthesize it and then build viral chimeras. RNA was transcribed fromsynthetic DNA and encapsidated with capsid protein in vitro to make synthetic virions. Plantsinoculated with the virions did not develop symptoms. When two nucleotide mutationspresent in the original sequence; but not present in most other TMV sequences in GenBank;were altered to reflect the consensus; the derivative synthetic virions produced classic TMVsymptoms. Chimeras were then made by exchanging TMV capsid protein DNA with …,Genome biology,2014,11

Rpp1 is asoybean gene that confers immunity to soybean rust; and it is important to understand how itregulates the soybean defense system and to use this knowledge to protect commercialcrops. It was previously discovered that some soybean proteins resembling transcriptionfactors accumulate in the nucleus of Rpp1 soybeans. To determine if they contribute toimmunity; Bean pod mottle virus was used to attenuate or silence the expression of theirgenes. Rpp1 plants subjected to virus-induced gene silencing exhibited reduced amounts ofRNA for 5 of the tested genes; and the plants developed rust-like symptoms aftersubsequent inoculation with fungal spores.

Coding DNA repeated throughout intergenic regions of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome: evolutionary footprints of RNA silencing,Jian Feng; Daniel Q Naiman; Bret Cooper,Pyknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-codinggenomicDNA that also appear at least once among coding genes. They are interestingbecause they portend an unforeseen connection between coding and non-coding DNA.Pyknons have only been discovered in the human genome; so it is unknown whetherpyknons have wider biological relevance or are simply a phenomenon of the humangenome. To address this; DNA sequence patterns from the Arabidopsis thalianagenomewere detected using a probability-based method. 24 654 statistically significant sequencepatterns; 16 to 24 nucleotides long; repeating 10 or more times in non-coding DNA alsoappeared in 46% of A. thalianaprotein-coding genes.

Proteomic pleiotropy of OpgGH; an operon necessary for efficient growth of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium under low-osmotic conditions,Bret Cooper; Ruiqiang Chen; Wesley M Garrett; Charles Murphy; Caren Chang; Mark L Tucker; Arvind A Bhagwat,Salmonella enterica; a bacterial; food-borne pathogen of humans; can contaminate rawfruits and vegetables. Unfortunately for consumers; the bacteria can survive in water used towash away contaminating bacteria. The ability to survive the low-osmotic conditions of thewash water is attributed to the OpgGH operon that leads to the production of osmoticallyregulated periplasmic glucans. Mutants lacking OpgGH grow slowly under low-osmoticconditions; but there are also unexpected traits such as abnormal flagellar motility andreduced virulence in mice. To get a broader understanding of these pleiotropic effects underlow osmolarity; we examined the proteome of these mutants using high-throughput massspectrometry. We identified approximately one-third of the proteins encoded by the genomeand used label-free spectral counting to determine the relative amounts of proteins in wild …,Journal of proteome research,2012,9

Phosphothreonine 218 is required for the function of SR45. 1 in regulating flower petal development in Arabidopsis,Xiao-Ning Zhang; Cecilia Mo; Wesley M Garrett; Bret Cooper,RNA splicing is crucial to the production of mature mRNAs (mRNA). In Arabidopsis thaliana;the protein Arginine/Serine-rich 45 (SR45) acts as an RNA splicing activator and initiates thespliceosome assembly. SR45 is alternatively spliced into 2 isoforms. Isoform 1 (SR45. 1)plays an important role in the flower petal development whereas isoform 2 (SR45. 2) isimportant for root growth. In this study; we used immunoprecipitation to isolate an SR45. 1-GFP fusion protein from transgenic plants complementing a null mutant; sr45–1. Massspectrometry suggested a single phosphorylation event in a peptide from the alternativelyspliced region unique to SR45. 1.

The problem with peptide presumption and the downfall of target–decoy false discovery rates,Bret Cooper,In proteomics; peptide-tandem mass spectrum match scores and target–decoy databasederived false discovery rates (FDR) are confidence indicators describing the quality ofindividual and sets of tandem mass spectrum matches. A user can impose a standard byprescribing a limit to these values; equivalent to drawing a line that separates better frompoorer quality matches. As a result of setting narrower parent ion mass tolerances to reflectthe better resolution of modern mass spectrometers; target–decoy derived FDRs candiminish. FDRs lowered this way consequently drive down the lower-limit for peptide-spectrum match score acceptance. Hence; data quality confidence appears to improve evenwhile fragmentation evidence for some spectra remains weak. One negative outcome canbe the presumed identification of peptides that do not exist. The options researchers have …,Analytical chemistry,2012,7
Correlation of multiple peptide mass spectra for phosphoprotein identification,Jian Feng; Wesley M Garrett; Daniel Q Naiman; Bret Cooper,When collision induced dissociation is used to fragment phosphorylated peptides duringtandem mass spectrometry (MS2); an ion exhibiting the neutral loss of phosphoric acid canbe the major product. The neutral loss ion can then be fragmented during MS3 for additionalresolution of the peptide sequence. Together; MS2 and MS3 spectral pairs can offersupporting identification of phosphorylated peptides and proteins. Here; the softwareprogram PANORAMICS has been modified to make use of Mascot results for MS2 and MS3spectral data sets. For pairs; the algorithm considers the number of shared m/z peaks usedfor peptide assignment and then adjusts the score evaluating that a peptide was correctlymatched to these spectra using a mathematical model. The algorithm then calculatespeptide probabilities for paired and unpaired spectra; and deduces a probability that a …,Journal of proteome research,2009,7

Capsid protein gene and the type of host plant differentially modulate cell-to-cell movement of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus,ALN Rao; B Cooper,Abstract A study was undertaken to measure the rate of coat protein (CP) independent cell-to-cell movement of cowpea chlorotic mottle bromovirus (CCMV) in three different hostplants. A CCMV RNA3 variant in which the CP gene was substituted with enhanced greenfluorescent protein (C3/ΔCP-EGFP) was coinoculated to three different host plants withtranscripts of wild type RNAs 1 and 2. Comparative analysis of cell-to-cell movementmonitored by the EGFP expression at various days post inoculation revealed that the rate ofspread varied with the type of host species inoculated: fastest movement was observed inNicotiana benthamiana while the rate spread was significantly slower in the natural hostcowpea. When CP was expressed as EGFP fusion (C3/CP: EGFP) the rate of spread in N.benthamiana and C. quinoa was slower than that was observed in the absence of CP and …,Virus genes,2006,5

To solve thisproblem; a new data structure based on dynamic arrays was designed and implemented inan algorithm that parses semi-ordered data made by Mascot; a separate software programthat matches peptide tandem mass spectra to protein sequences in a database. Byaccommodating the special features of these large datasets; the combined dynamic array(CDA) provides efficient searching and insertion operations. The operations on real datasetsusing this new data structure are hundreds times faster than operations using binary treeand red-black tree structures. The difference becomes more significant when the datasetsize grows. This data structure may be useful for improving the speed of other related …,Journal of computational biology,2008,1
A Proteomic Network for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation Efficiency in Bradyrhizobium elkanii,Bret Cooper; Kimberly B Campbell; Hunter S Beard; Wesley M Garrett; Joseph Mowery; Gary R Bauchan; Patrick Elia,Rhizobia colonize legumes and reduce N2 to NH3 in root nodules. The current model is thatsymbiotic rhizobia bacteroids avoid assimilating this NH3. Instead; host legume cells formglutamine from NH3; and the nitrogen is returned to the bacteroid as dicarboxylates;peptides; and amino acids. In soybean cells surrounding bacteroids; glutamine also isconverted to ureides. One problem for soybean cultivation is inefficiency in symbiotic N2fixation; the biochemical basis of which is unknown. Here; the proteomes of bacteroids ofBradyrhizobium elkanii USDA76 isolated from N2 fixation-efficient Peking and-inefficientWilliams 82 soybean nodules were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Nearly half of theencoded bacterial proteins were quantified. Efficient bacteroids produced greater amountsof enzymes to form Nod factors and had increased amounts of signaling proteins …,Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions,2018,*
Protection Against Common Bean Rust Conferred by a Gene-Silencing Method,Bret Cooper; Kimberly B Campbell,Rust disease of the dry bean plant; Phaseolus vulgaris; is caused by the fungus Uromycesappendiculatus. The fungus acquires its nutrients and energy from bean leaves using aspecialized cell structure; the haustorium; through which it secretes effector proteins thatcontribute to pathogenicity by defeating the plant immune system. Candidate effectors havebeen identified by DNA sequencing and motif analysis; and some candidates have beenobserved in infected leaves by mass spectrometry. To assess their roles in pathogenicity; wehave inserted small fragments of genes for five candidates into Bean pod mottle virus. Plantswere infected with recombinant virus and then challenged with U. appendiculatus. Virus-infected plants expressing gene fragments for four of five candidate effectors accumulatedlower amounts of rust and had dramatically less rust disease. By contrast; controls that …,Phytopathology,2017,*
Doubling down on phosphorylation as a variable peptide modification,Bret Cooper,Abstract Some mass spectrometrists believe that searching for variable PTMs likephosphorylation of serine or threonine when using database-search algorithms to interpretpeptide tandem mass spectra will increase false-positive matching. The basis for this is thepremise that the algorithm compares a spectrum to both a nonphosphorylated peptidecandidate and a phosphorylated candidate; which is double the number of candidatescompared to a search with no possible phosphorylation. Hence; if the search space doubles;false-positive matching could increase accordingly as the algorithm considers morecandidates to which false matches could be made. In this study; it is shown that the searchfor variable phosphoserine and phosphothreonine modifications does not always double thesearch space or unduly impinge upon the FDR.

Main content area Parallelized Binary Search Tree,Jian Feng; Daniel Q Naiman; Bret Cooper,Abstract: PTTRNFNDR is an unsupervised statistical learning algorithm that detects patternsin DNA sequences; protein sequences; or any natural language texts that can bedecomposed into letters of a finite alphabet. PTTRNFNDR performs complex mathematicalcomputations and its processing time increases when input texts become large. To achievebetter speed performance; several strategies were applied in the implementation of theprogram; including parallel operations of binary search trees. A standard binary search treeis not thread-safe due to its dynamic insertion and deletions. Here; we adjusted the standardbinary search tree for parallelized operations to achieve improved performance of thePTTRNFNDR algorithm. The method can be applied to other software platforms to quickendata searching through parallel operations of binary search trees when several …,Journal of Information Technology,2011,*

INHIBITION OF FUSARIUM GRAMINEARUM GERMLING DEVELOPMENT CAUSED BY COMBINATORIALLY SELECTED DEFENSE PEPTIDES.,NW Gross; ZD Fang; B Cooper; FJ Schmidt; JT English,ABSTRACT To address the problem of head blight in wheat; we are applying combinatorialpeptide techniques to identify molecules that serve as antagonists to developing germlingsof Fusarium graminearum. In this methodology; we mixed phage-display libraries thatdisplay 8-mer random peptides with F. graminearum germlings derived from macroconidia.Phage clones with binding affinity for germlings were recovered and amplified in E. coli.After additional rounds of incubation and amplification; we have recovered numerouspeptides with affinity for surface molecules of germlings. We have sequenced an initialcollection of selected peptides and are now evaluating their abilities to inhibit germlinggrowth and development. At completion of these phenotype screens; we will test candidatepeptides for inhibitory function when displayed on recently developed scaffold proteins.,2007 National Fusarium Head Blight Forum,2007,*

Shotgun identification of proteins from rust spores,Bret Cooper; Wesley Garrett; Kimberly Campbell,Technical Abstract: We are interested in learning more about the proteome of Uromycesappendiculatus; the causal agent of common bean rust. The knowledge of the proteins thatform uredospores; germlings; appressoria; and haustoria may be used to define host-pathogen interactions or serve as targets for chemical inhibition of the fungus. We have usedliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a high-throughput fashionto identify~ 400 proteins from uredospores. An abundance of heat-shock proteins andtranslation elongation factors portends a spore's ability to survive stresses and jump-startprotein production when germination is initiated.,Mid Atlantic Plant Molecular Biology Society Conference,2005,*

Plant disease resistance genes,*,Plants are capable of activating a large array of defense mechanisms in response to pathogenattack; some of which are preexisting and others are inducible. Pathogens must specialize tocircumvent the defense mechanisms of the host; especially those biotrophic pathogens that derivetheir nutrition from an intimate association with living plant cells. If the pathogen can causedisease; the interaction is said to be compatible; but if the plant is resistant; the interaction issaid to be incompatible. A crucial factor determining the success of these mechanisms is thespeed of their activation. Consequently; there is considerable interest in understanding howplants recognize pathogen attack and control expression of defense mechanisms … Somepotential pathogens trigger a very rapid resistance response called gene -for- generesistance.
