Efficient retrieval of the top-k most relevant spatial web objects,Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Dingming Wu,Abstract The conventional Internet is acquiring a geo-spatial dimension. Web documents arebeing geo-tagged; and geo-referenced objects such as points of interest are beingassociated with descriptive text documents. The resulting fusion of geo-location anddocuments enables a new kind of top-k query that takes into account both location proximityand text relevancy. To our knowledge; only naive techniques exist that are capable ofcomputing a general web information retrieval query while also taking location into account.This paper proposes a new indexing framework for location-aware top-k text retrieval. Theframework leverages the inverted file for text retrieval and the R-tree for spatial proximityquerying. Several indexing approaches are explored within the framework. The frameworkencompasses algorithms that utilize the proposed indexes for computing the top-k query …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,500
Community-based greedy algorithm for mining top-k influential nodes in mobile social networks,Yu Wang; Gao Cong; Guojie Song; Kunqing Xie,Abstract With the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless technologies; mobile socialnetwork systems are increasingly available. A mobile social network plays an essential roleas the spread of information and influence in the form of" word-of-mouth". It is a fundamentalissue to find a subset of influential individuals in a mobile social network such that targetingthem initially (eg to adopt a new product) will maximize the spread of the influence (furtheradoptions of the new product). The problem of finding the most influential nodes isunfortunately NP-hard. It has been shown that a Greedy algorithm with provableapproximation guarantees can give good approximation; However; it is computationallyexpensive; if not prohibitive; to run the greedy algorithm on a large mobile network. In thispaper we propose a new algorithm called Community-based Greedy algorithm for mining …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,339
Time-aware point-of-interest recommendation,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growinglocation based social networks (LBSNs) enables many important location-aware services tousers. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services; which is torecommend places where users have not visited before. Several techniques have beenrecently proposed for the recommendation service. However; no existing work hasconsidered the temporal information for POI recommendations in LBSNs. We believe thattime plays an important role in POI recommendations because most users tend to visitdifferent places at different time in a day;\eg visiting a restaurant at noon and visiting a bar atnight. In this paper; we define a new problem; namely; the time-aware POI recommendation;to recommend POIs for a given user at a specified time in a day. To solve the problem; we …,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,325
Improving data quality: Consistency and accuracy,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Shuai Ma,Abstract Two central criteria for data quality are consistency and accuracy. Inconsistenciesand errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirtydatabase D; one needs automated methods to make it consistent; ie; find a repair D'thatsatisfies the constraints and" minimally" differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that theautomatically-generated repair D'is accurate; or makes sense; ie; D'differs from the" correct"data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving bothdata consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies(CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data; which are able to captureinconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improvethe consistency of the data; we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,304
Collective spatial keyword querying,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging; spatial web objects thatpossess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence;and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining inprominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individualobjects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in agroup collectively satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatial webobjects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that objects arenearest to the query location and have the lowest inter-object distances. Specifically; westudy two variants of this problem; both of which are NP-complete. We devise exact solutionsas well as approximate solutions with provable approximation bounds to the problems …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,295
Mining significant semantic locations from GPS data,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the increasing deployment and use of GPS-enabled devices; massiveamounts of GPS data are becoming available. We propose a general framework for themining of semantically meaningful; significant locations; eg; shopping malls and restaurants;from such data. We present techniques capable of extracting semantic locations from GPSdata. We capture the relationships between locations and between locations and users witha graph. Significance is then assigned to locations using random walks over the graph thatpropagates significance among the locations. In doing so; mutual reinforcement betweenlocation significance and user authority is exploited for determining significance; as areaspects such as the number of visits to a location; the durations of the visits; and thedistances users travel to reach locations.

Carpenter: Finding closed patterns in long biological datasets,Feng Pan; Gao Cong; Anthony KH Tung; Jiong Yang; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract The growth of bioinformatics has resulted in datasets with new characteristics.These datasets typically contain a large number of columns and a small number of rows. Forexample; many gene expression datasets may contain 10;000-100;000 columns but only100-1000 rows. Such datasets pose a great challenge for existing (closed) frequent patterndiscovery algorithms; since they have an exponential dependence on the average rowlength. In this paper; we describe a new algorithm called CARPENTER that is speciallydesigned to handle datasets having a large number of attributes and relatively small numberof rows. Several experiments on real bioinformatics datasets show that CARPENTER isorders of magnitude better than previous closed pattern mining algorithms like CLOSET andCHARM.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,253
Finding question-answer pairs from online forums,Gao Cong; Long Wang; Chin-Yew Lin; Young-In Song; Yueheng Sun,Abstract Online forums contain a huge amount of valuable user generated content. In thispaper we address the problem of extracting question-answer pairs from forums. Question-answer pairs extracted from forums can be used to help Question Answering services (egYahoo!

Retrieving top-k prestige-based relevant spatial web objects,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The location-aware keyword query returns ranked objects that are near a querylocation and that have textual descriptions that match query keywords. This query occursinherently in many types of mobile and traditional web services and applications; eg; YellowPages and Maps services. Previous work considers the potential results of such a query asbeing independent when ranking them. However; a relevant result object with nearbyobjects that are also relevant to the query is likely to be preferable over a relevant objectwithout relevant nearby objects. The paper proposes the concept of prestige-basedrelevance to capture both the textual relevance of an object to a query and the effects ofnearby objects. Based on this; a new type of query; the Location-aware top-k Prestige-basedText retrieval (LkPT) query; is proposed that retrieves the top-k spatial web objects ranked …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,214
Spatial keyword query processing: an experimental evaluation,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Dingming Wu,Abstract Geo-textual indices play an important role in spatial keyword querying. The existinggeo-textual indices have not been compared systematically under the same experimentalframework. This makes it difficult to determine which indexing technique best supportsspecific functionality. We provide an all-around survey of 12 state-of-the-art geo-textualindices. We propose a benchmark that enables the comparison of the spatial keyword queryperformance. We also report on the findings obtained when applying the benchmark to theindices; thus uncovering new insights that may guide index selection as well as furtherresearch.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,177
Farmer: Finding interesting rule groups in microarray datasets,Gao Cong; Anthony KH Tung; Xin Xu; Feng Pan; Jiong Yang,Abstract Microarray datasets typically contain large number of columns but small number ofrows. Association rules have been proved to be useful in analyzing such datasets. However;most existing association rule mining algorithms are unable to efficiently handle datasetswith large number of columns. Moreover; the number of association rules generated fromsuch datasets is enormous due to the large number of possible column combinations. In thispaper; we describe a new algorithm called FARMER that is specially designed to discoverassociation rules from microarray datasets. Instead of finding individual association rules;FARMER finds interesting rule groups which are essentially a set of rules that are generatedfrom the same set of rows. Unlike conventional rule mining algorithms; FARMER searchesfor interesting rules in the row enumeration space and exploits all user-specified …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,172
Mining top-k covering rule groups for gene expression data,Gao Cong; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Xin Xu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm to discover the top-k covering rulegroups for each row of gene expression profiles. Several experiments on real bioinformaticsdatasets show that the new top-k covering rule mining algorithm is orders of magnitudefaster than previous association rule mining algorithms. Furthermore; we propose a newclassification method RCBT. RCBT classifier is constructed from the top-k covering rulegroups. The rule groups generated for building RCBT are bounded in number. This is incontrast to existing rule-based classification methods like CBA [19] which despite generatingexcessive number of redundant rules; is still unable to cover some training data with thediscovered rules. Experiments show that the RCBT classifier can match or outperform otherstate-of-the-art classifiers on several benchmark gene expression datasets.

Who; where; when and what: discover spatio-temporal topics for twitter users,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract Micro-blogging services; such as Twitter; and location-based social networkapplications have generated short text messages associated with geographic information;posting time; and user ids. The availability of such data received from users offers a goodopportunity to study the user's spatial-temporal behavior and preference. In this paper; wepropose a probabilistic model W 4 (short for Who+Where+When+What) to exploit such datato discover individual users' mobility behaviors from spatial; temporal and activity aspects.To the best of our knowledge; our work offers the first solution to jointly model individualuser's mobility behavior from the three aspects. Our model has a variety of applications; suchas user profiling and location prediction; it can be employed to answer questions suchas``Can we infer the location of a user given a tweet posted by the user and the posting …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,138
On predicting the popularity of newly emerging hashtags in twitter,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Gao Cong,Abstract Because of Twitter's popularity and the viral nature of information dissemination onTwitter; predicting which Twitter topics will become popular in the near future becomes atask of considerable economic importance. Many Twitter topics are annotated by hashtags.In this article; we propose methods to predict the popularity of new hashtags on Twitter byformulating the problem as a classification task. We use five standard classification models(ie; Naïve bayes; k-nearest neighbors; decision trees; support vector machines; and logisticregression) for prediction. The main challenge is the identification of effective features fordescribing new hashtags. We extract 7 content features from a hashtag string and thecollection of tweets containing the hashtag and 11 contextual features from the social graphformed by users who have adopted the hashtag. We conducted experiments on a Twitter …,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2013,135
Reverse spatial and textual k nearest neighbor search,Jiaheng Lu; Ying Lu; Gao Cong,Abstract Geographic objects associated with descriptive texts are becoming prevalent. Thisgives prominence to spatial keyword queries that take into account both the locations andtextual descriptions of content. Specifically; the relevance of an object to a query ismeasured by spatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textualsimilarity. In this paper; we define Reverse Spatial Textual k Nearest Neighbor (RSTkNN)query; ie; finding objects that take the query object as one of their k most spatial-textualsimilar objects. Existing works on reverse kNN queries focus solely on spatial locations butignore text relevance. To answer RSTkNN queries efficiently; we propose a hybrid index treecalled IUR-tree (Intersection-Union R-Tree) that effectively combines location proximity withtextual similarity. Based on the IUR-tree; we design a branch-and-bound search algorithm …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,134
Spatial keyword querying,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Qiang Qu; Anders Skovsgaard; Dingming Wu; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract The web is increasingly being used by mobile users. In addition; it is increasinglybecoming possible to accurately geo-position mobile users and web content. Thisdevelopment gives prominence to spatial web data management. Specifically; a spatialkeyword query takes a user location and user-supplied keywords as arguments and returnsweb objects that are spatially and textually relevant to these arguments. This paper reviewsrecent results by the authors that aim to achieve spatial keyword querying functionality that iseasy to use; relevant to users; and can be supported efficiently. The paper covers differentkinds of functionality as well as the ideas underlying their definition.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,130
Efficient continuously moving top-k spatial keyword query processing,Dingming Wu; Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen; Gao Cong,Web users and content are increasingly being geo-positioned. This development givesprominence to spatial keyword queries; which involve both the locations and textualdescriptions of content. We study the efficient processing of continuously moving top-kspatial keyword (MkSK) queries over spatial keyword data. State-of-the-art solutions formoving queries employ safe zones that guarantee the validity of reported results as long asthe user remains within a zone. However; existing safe zone methods focus solely on spatiallocations and ignore text relevancy. We propose two algorithms for computing safe zonesthat guarantee correct results at any time and that aim to optimize the computation on theserver as well as the communication between the server and the client. We exploit tight andconservative approximations of safe zones and aggressive computational space pruning …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,121
Routing questions to the right users in online communities,Yanhong Zhou; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen; Junjie Yao,Online forums contain huge amounts of valuable user-generated content. In current forumsystems; users have to passively wait for other users to visit the forum systems andread/answer their questions. The user experience for question answering suffers from thisarrangement. In this paper; we address the problem of" pushing" the right questions to theright persons; the objective being to obtain quick; high-quality answers; thus improving usersatisfaction. We propose a framework for the efficient and effective routing of a givenquestion to the top-k potential experts (users) in a forum; by utilizing both the content andstructures of the forum system. First; we compute the expertise of users according to thecontent of the forum system—-this is to estimate the probability of a user being an expert fora given question based on the previous question answering of the user.

Simulated Annealing Based Influence Maximization in Social Networks.,Qingye Jiang; Guojie Song; Gao Cong; Yu Wang; Wenjun Si; Kunqing Xie,Abstract The problem of influence maximization; ie; mining top-k influential nodes from asocial network such that the spread of influence in the network is maximized; is NP-hard.Most of the existing algorithms for the problem are based on greedy algorithm. Althoughgreedy algorithm can achieve a good approximation; it is computational expensive. In thispaper; we propose a totally different approach based on Simulated Annealing (SA) for theinfluence maximization problem. This is the first SA based algorithm for the problem.Additionally; we propose two heuristic methods to accelerate the convergence process ofSA; and a new method of computing influence to speed up the proposed algorithm.Experimental results on four real networks show that the proposed algorithms run faster thanthe state-of-the-art greedy algorithm by 2-3 orders of magnitude while being able to …,AAAI,2011,103
A survey on enhanced subspace clustering,Kelvin Sim; Vivekanand Gopalkrishnan; Arthur Zimek; Gao Cong,Abstract Subspace clustering finds sets of objects that are homogeneous in subspaces ofhigh-dimensional datasets; and has been successfully applied in many domains. In recentyears; a new breed of subspace clustering algorithms; which we denote as enhancedsubspace clustering algorithms; have been proposed to (1) handle the increasingabundance and complexity of data and to (2) improve the clustering results. In this survey;we present these enhanced approaches to subspace clustering by discussing the problemsthey are solving; their cluster definitions and algorithms. Besides enhanced subspaceclustering; we also present the basic subspace clustering and the related works in high-dimensional clustering.,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2013,99
The use of categorization information in language models for question retrieval,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian Søndergaard Jensen; Ce Zhang,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular type of servicemeeting a wide range of information needs. Such services enable users to ask and answerquestions and to access existing question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain very largevolumes of valuable user-generated content and have become important informationresources on the Web. To make the body of knowledge accumulated in CQA archivesaccessible; effective and efficient question search is required. Question search in a CQAarchive aims to retrieve historical questions that are relevant to new questions posed byusers. This paper proposes a category-based framework for search in CQA archives.

Graph-based point-of-interest recommendation with geographical and temporal influences,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Aixin Sun,Abstract The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growinglocation-based social networks (LBSNs) enables a number of important location-awareservices. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services; which is torecommend POIs that users have not visited before. It has been observed that:(i) users tendto visit nearby places; and (ii) users tend to visit different places in different time slots; and inthe same time slot; users tend to periodically visit the same places. For example; usersusually visit a restaurant during lunch hours; and visit a pub at night. In this paper; we focuson the problem of time-aware POI recommendation; which aims at recommending a list ofPOIs for a user to visit at a given time.

A generalized framework of exploring category information for question retrieval in community question answer archives,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular type of servicewhere users ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer pairs. CQAarchives contain very large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchy of categories.As an essential function of CQA services; question retrieval in a CQA archive aims to retrievehistorical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. In this paper; wepresent a new approach to exploiting category information of questions for improving theperformance of question retrieval; and we apply the approach to existing question retrievalmodels; including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model.

Shortest path and distance queries on road networks: An experimental evaluation,Lingkun Wu; Xiaokui Xiao; Dingxiong Deng; Gao Cong; Andy Diwen Zhu; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Computing the shortest path between two given locations in a road network is animportant problem that finds applications in various map services and commercialnavigation products. The state-of-the-art solutions for the problem can be divided into twocategories: spatial-coherence-based methods and vertex-importance-based approaches.The two categories of techniques; however; have not been compared systematically underthe same experimental framework; as they were developed from two independent lines ofresearch that do not refer to each other. This renders it difficult for a practitioner to decidewhich technique should be adopted for a specific application. Furthermore; the experimentalevaluation of the existing techniques; as presented in previous work; falls short in severalaspects.

Time constrained influence maximization in social networks,Bo Liu; Gao Cong; Dong Xu; Yifeng Zeng,Influence maximization is a fundamental research problem in social networks. Viralmarketing; one of its applications; is to get a small number of users to adopt a product; whichsubsequently triggers a large cascade of further adoptions by utilizing" Word-of-Mouth" effectin social networks. Influence maximization problem has been extensively studied recently.However; none of the previous work considers the time constraint in the influencemaximization problem. In this paper; we propose the time constrained influencemaximization problem. We show that the problem is NP-hard; and prove the monotonicityand submodularity of the time constrained influence spread function. Based on this; wedevelop a greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. To improve the algorithmscalability; we propose two Influence Spreading Path based methods.

Rank-geofm: A ranking based geographical factorization method for point of interest recommendation,Xutao Li; Gao Cong; Xiao-Li Li; Tuan-Anh Nguyen Pham; Shonali Krishnaswamy,Abstract With the rapid growth of location-based social networks; Point of Interest (POI)recommendation has become an important research problem. However; the scarcity of thecheck-in data; a type of implicit feedback data; poses a severe challenge for existing POIrecommendation methods. Moreover; different types of context information about POIs areavailable and how to leverage them becomes another challenge. In this paper; we proposea ranking based geographical factorization method; called Rank-GeoFM; for POIrecommendation; which addresses the two challenges. In the proposed model; we considerthat the check-in frequency characterizes users' visiting preference and learn thefactorization by ranking the POIs correctly. In our model; POIs both with and without check-ins will contribute to learning the ranking and thus the data sparsity problem can be …,Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2015,81

In thispaper; we propose a general framework based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) todetect the contexts and answers of questions from forum threads. We improve the basicframework by Skip-chain CRFs and 2D CRFs to better accommodate the features of forumsfor better performance.

Joint top-k spatial keyword query processing,Dingming Wu; Man Lung Yiu; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Web users and content are increasingly being geopositioned; and increased focus is beinggiven to serving local content in response to web queries. This development calls for spatialkeyword queries that take into account both the locations and textual descriptions of content.We study the efficient; joint processing of multiple top-k spatial keyword queries. Such jointprocessing is attractive during high query loads and also occurs when multiple queries areused to obfuscate a user's true query. We propose a novel algorithm and index structure forthe joint processing of top-k spatial keyword queries. Empirical studies show that theproposed solution is efficient on real data sets. We also offer analytical studies on syntheticdata sets to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,78
Using partial evaluation in distributed query evaluation,Peter Buneman; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract A basic idea in parallel query processing is that one is prepared to do morecomputation than strictly necessary at individual sites in order to reduce the elapsed time;the network traffic; or both in the evaluation of the query. We develop this idea for theevaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented; both horizontally andvertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site whichpartially evaluates; in parallel; the query and sends the results as compact boolean functionsto a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has severaladvantages. First; each site is visited only once; even if several fragments of the tree arestored at that site. Second; no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed;nor is any structural information about the tree required; such as a DTD. Third; there is a …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,71

In this paper; we study the next new POI recommendation problem inwhich new POIs with respect to users' current location are to be recommended. Thechallenge lies in the difficulty in precisely learning users' sequential information andpersonalizing the recommendation model. To this end; we resort to the Metric Embeddingmethod for the recommendation; which avoids drawbacks of the Matrix Factorizationtechnique. We propose a personalized ranking metric embedding method (PRME) to modelpersonalized check-in sequences.

Keyword-aware optimal route search,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Identifying a preferable route is an important problem that finds applications in mapservices. When a user plans a trip within a city; the user may want to find" a most popularroute such that it passes by shopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to andfrom his hotel is within 4 hours." However; none of the algorithms in the existing work onroute planning can be used to answer such queries. Motivated by this; we define theproblem of keyword-aware optimal route query; denoted by KOR; which is to find an optimalroute such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint issatisfied; and an objective score of the route is optimal. The problem of answering KORqueries is NP-hard. We devise an approximation algorithm OSScaling with provableapproximation bounds. Based on this algorithm; another more efficient approximation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,55
Distributed query evaluation with performance guarantees,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract Partial evaluation has recently proven an effective technique for evaluating BooleanXPath queries over a fragmented tree that is distributed over a number of sites. What leftopen is whether or not the technique is applicable to generic data-selecting XPath queries.In contrast to Boolean queries that return a single truth value; a generic XPath query returnsa set of elements; and its evaluation introduces difficulties to avoiding excessive datashipping. This paper settles this question in positive by providing evaluation algorithms andoptimizations for generic XPath queries in the same distributed and fragmented setting.These algorithms explore parallelism and retain the performance guarantees of theircounterpart for Boolean queries; regardless of how the tree is fragmented and distributed.First; each site is visited at most three times; and down to at most twice when …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,55
Temporal spatial-keyword top-k publish/subscribe,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xin Cao; Kian-Lee Tan,Massive amount of data that are geo-tagged and associated with text information are beinggenerated at an unprecedented scale. These geo-textual data cover a wide range of topics.Users are interested in receiving up-to-date tweets such that their locations are close to auser specified location and their texts are interesting to users. For example; a user may wantto be updated with tweets near her home on the topic “food poisoning vomiting.” Weconsider the Temporal Spatial-Keyword Top-k Subscription (TaSK) query. Given a TaSKquery; we continuously maintain up-to-date top-k most relevant results over a stream of geo-textual objects (eg; geo-tagged Tweets) for the query.

COBBLER: combining column and row enumeration for closed pattern discovery,Feng Pan; Anthony KH Tung; Gao Cong; Xin Xu,The problem of mining frequent closed patterns has received considerable attention recentlyas it promises to have much less redundancy compared to discovering all frequent patterns.Existing algorithms can presently be separated into two groups; feature (column)enumeration and row enumeration. Feature enumeration algorithms like CHARM andCLOSET+ are efficient for datasets with small number of features and large number of rowssince the number of feature combinations to be enumerated is small. Row enumerationalgorithms like CARPENTER on the other hand are more suitable for datasets (eg.bioinformatics data) with large number of features and small number of rows. Both groups ofalgorithms; however; will encounter problem for datasets that have large number of rowsand features. In this paper; we describe a new algorithm called COBBLER which can …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2004,52

The use of wildcard is animportant aspect of substructure discovery from semi-structured data due to the irregularityand lack of fixed structure of such data. This paper proposes a more general and powerfulwildcard mechanism; which allows us to find more complex and interesting substructuresthan existing techniques. Furthermore; the complexity of structural information of semi-structured data and the usage of wildcard make the existing frequent set mining algorithmsinapplicable for substructure discovery. In this work; we adopt a vertical format for the …,*,2002,52
COM: a generative model for group recommendation,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Chin-Yew Lin,Abstract With the rapid development of online social networks; a growing number of peopleare willing to share their group activities; eg having dinners with colleagues; and watchingmovies with spouses. This motivates the studies on group recommendation; which aims torecommend items for a group of users. Group recommendation is a challenging problembecause different group members have different preferences; and how to make a trade-offamong their preferences for recommendation is still an open problem. In this paper; wepropose a probabilistic model named COM (COnsensus Model) to model the generativeprocess of group activities; and make group recommendations. Intuitively; users in a groupmay have different influences; and those who are expert in topics relevant to the group areusually more influential. In addition; users in a group may behave differently as group …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,48
Speed-up iterative frequent itemset mining with constraint changes,Gao Cong; Bing Liu,Mining of frequent itemsets is a fundamental data mining task. Past research has proposedmany efficient algorithms for this purpose. Recent work also highlighted the importance ofusing constraints to focus the mining process to mine only those relevant itemsets. Inpractice; data mining is often an interactive and iterative process. The user typically changesconstraints and runs the mining algorithm many times before being satisfied with the finalresults. This interactive process is very time consuming. Existing mining algorithms areunable to take advantage of this iterative process to use previous mining results to speed upthe current mining process. This results in an enormous waste of time and computation. Inthis paper; we propose an efficient technique to utilize previous mining results to improve theefficiency of current mining when constraints are changed. We first introduce the concept …,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2002. Proceedings. 2002 IEEE International Conference on,2002,46
Topic-driven reader comments summarization,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong,Abstract Readers of a news article often read its comments contributed by other readers. Byreading comments; readers obtain not only complementary information about this newsarticle but also the opinions from other readers. However; the existing ranking mechanismsfor comments (eg; by recency or by user rating) fail to offer an overall picture of topicsdiscussed in comments. In this paper; we first propose to study Topic-driven ReaderComments Summarization (Torcs) problem. We observe that many news articles from anews stream are related to each other; so are their comments. Hence; news articles andtheir associated comments provide context information for user commenting. To implicitlycapture the context information; we propose two topic models to address the Torcs problem;namely; Master-Slave Topic Model (MSTM) and Extended Master-Slave Topic Model …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,44
Annotation propagation revisited for key preserving views,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract This paper revisits the analysis of annotation propagation from source databases toviews defined in terms of conjunctive (SPJ) queries. Given a source database D; an SPJquery Q; the view Q (D) and a tuple ΔV in the view; the view (resp. source) side-effectproblem is to find a minimal set ΔD of tuples such that the deletion of ΔD from D results in thedeletion of ΔV from Q (D) while minimizing the side effects on the view (resp. the source). Athird problem; referred to as the annotation placement problem; is to find a single base tupleΔD such that annotation in a field of ΔD propagates to ΔV while minimizing the propagationto other fields in the view Q (D). These are important for data provenance and themanagement of view updates. However important; these problems are unfortunately NP-hard for most subclasses of SPJ views [5].

Enhancing naive bayes with various smoothing methods for short text classification,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract Partly due to the proliferance of microblog; short texts are becoming prominent. Ahuge number of short texts are generated every day; which calls for a method that canefficiently accommodate new data to incrementally adjust classification models. Naive Bayesmeets such a need. We apply several smoothing models to Naive Bayes for question topicclassification; as an example of short text classification; and study their performance. Theexperimental results on a large real question data show that the smoothing methods areable to significantly improve the question classification performance of Naive Bayes. Wealso study the effect of training data size; and question length on performance.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,43
An efficient query indexing mechanism for filtering geo-textual data,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xin Cao,Abstract Massive amount of data that are geo-tagged and associated with text informationare being generated at an unprecedented scale. Users may want to be notified of interestinggeo-textual objects during a period of time. For example; a user may want to be informedwhen tweets containing term" garage sale" are posted within 5 km of the user's home in thenext 72 hours. In this paper; for the first time we study the problem of matching a stream ofincoming Boolean Range Continuous queries over a stream of incoming geo-textual objectsin real time. We develop a new system for addressing the problem. In particular; we proposea hybrid index; called IQ-tree; and novel cost models for managing a stream of incomingBoolean Range Continuous queries. We also propose algorithms for matching the querieswith incoming geo-textual objects based on the index.

A general graph-based model for recommendation in event-based social networks,Tuan-Anh Nguyen Pham; Xutao Li; Gao Cong; Zhenjie Zhang,Event-based social networks (EBSNs); such as Meetup and Plancast; which offer platformsfor users to plan; arrange; and publish events; have gained increasing popularity and rapidgrowth. EBSNs capture not only the online social relationship; but also the offlineinteractions from offline events. They contain rich heterogeneous information; includingmultiple types of entities; such as users; events; groups and tags; and their interactionrelations. Three recommendation tasks; namely recommending groups to users;recommending tags to groups; and recommending events to users; have been explored inthree separate studies. However; none of the proposed methods can handle all the threerecommendation tasks. In this paper; we propose a general graph-based model; calledHeteRS; to solve the three recommendation problems on EBSNs in one framework.

Who; where; when; and what: A nonparametric bayesian approach to context-aware recommendation and search for twitter users,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Kaiqi Zhao; Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun,Abstract Micro-blogging services and location-based social networks; such as Twitter;Weibo; and Foursquare; enable users to post short messages with timestamps andgeographical annotations. The rich spatial-temporal-semantic information of individualsembedded in these geo-annotated short messages provides exciting opportunity to developmany context-aware applications in ubiquitous computing environments. Exampleapplications include contextual recommendation and contextual search. To obtain accuraterecommendations and most relevant search results; it is important to capture users'contextual information (eg; time and location) and to understand users' topical interests andintentions. While time and location can be readily captured by smartphones; understandinguser's interests and intentions calls for effective methods in modeling user mobility …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2015,38

To the best knowledge; this is the first systematic evaluation of theperformance of different classification methods on question topic classification as well asshort texts. Specifically; we empirically evaluate the following in classifying questions intoCQA categories:(a) the usefulness of n-gram features and bag-of-word features;(b) theperformance of three standard classification algorithms (naive Bayes; maximum entropy;and support vector machines);(c) the performance of the state-of-the-art hierarchicalclassification algorithms;(d) the effect of training data size on performance; and (e) the …,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2012,36
Mining User Intents in Twitter: A Semi-Supervised Approach to Inferring Intent Categories for Tweets.,Jinpeng Wang; Gao Cong; Wayne Xin Zhao; Xiaoming Li,Abstract In this paper; we propose to study the problem of identifying and classifying tweetsinto intent categories. For example; a tweet “I wanna buy a new car” indicates the user'sintent for buying a car. Identifying such intent tweets will have great commercial valueamong others. In particular; it is important that we can distinguish different types of intenttweets. We propose to classify intent tweets into six categories; namely Food & Drink; Travel;Career & Education; Goods & Services; Event & Activities and Trifle. We propose a semi-supervised learning approach to categorizing intent tweets into the six categories. Weconstruct a test collection by using a bootstrap method. Our experimental results show thatour approach is effective in inferring intent categories for tweets.,AAAI,2015,33
One seed to find them all: mining opinion features via association,Zhen Hai; Kuiyu Chang; Gao Cong,Abstract Feature-based opinion analysis has attracted extensive attention recently.Identifying features associated with opinions expressed in reviews is essential for fine-grained opinion mining. One approach is to exploit the dependency relations that occurnaturally between features and opinion words; and among features (or opinion words)themselves. In this paper; we propose a generalized approach to opinion feature extractionby incorporating robust statistical association analysis in a bootstrapping framework. Thenew approach starts with a small set of feature seeds; on which it iteratively enlarges bymining feature-opinion; feature-feature; and opinion-opinion dependency relations. Twoassociation model types; namely likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and latent semantic analysis(LSA); are proposed for computing the pair-wise associations between terms (features or …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,33
Tagging your tweets: A probabilistic modeling of hashtag annotation in twitter,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong,Abstract The adoption of hashtags in major social networks including Twitter; Facebook; andGoogle+ is a strong evidence of its importance in facilitating information diffusion and socialchatting. To understand the factors (eg; user interest; posting time and tweet content) thatmay affect hashtag annotation in Twitter and to capture the implicit relations between latenttopics in tweets and their corresponding hashtags; we propose two PLSA-style topic modelsto model the hashtag annotation behavior in Twitter. Content-Pivoted Model (CPM) assumesthat tweet content guides the generation of hashtags while Hashtag-Pivoted Model (HPM)assumes that hashtags guide the generation of tweet content. Both models jointlyincorporate user; time; hashtag and tweet content in a probabilistic framework. The PLSA-style models also enable us to verify the impact of social factor on hashtag annotation by …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,32
Influence spreading path and its application to the time constrained social influence maximization problem and beyond,Bo Liu; Gao Cong; Yifeng Zeng; Dong Xu; Yeow Meng Chee,Influence maximization is a fundamental research problem in social networks. Viralmarketing; one of its applications; is to get a small number of users to adopt a product; whichsubsequently triggers a large cascade of further adoptions by utilizing “Word-of-Mouth” effectin social networks. Time plays an important role in the influence spread from one user toanother and the time needed for a user to influence another varies. In this paper; wepropose the time constrained influence maximization problem. We show that the problem isNP-hard; and prove the monotonicity and submodularity of the time constrained influencespread function. Based on this; we develop a greedy algorithm. To improve the algorithmscalability; we propose the concept of Influence Spreading Path in social networks anddevelop a set of new algorithms for the time constrained influence maximization problem …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,32
In search of influential event organizers in online social networks,Kaiyu Feng; Gao Cong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Shuai Ma,Abstract Recently; with the emergence of event-based online social services (eg Meetup);there have been increasing online activities to create; distribute; and organize social events.In this paper; we take the first systematic step to discover influential event organizers fromonline social networks who are essential to the overall success of social events. Informally;such event organizers comprise a small group of people who not only have the relevantskills or expertise that are required for an event (eg conference) but they are also able toinfluence largest number of people to actively contribute to it. We formulate it as the problemof mining influential cover set (ICS) where we wish to find k users in a social network G thattogether have the required skills or expertise (modeled as attributes of nodes in G) toorganize an event such that they can influence the greatest number of individuals to …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,31
Partial evaluation for distributed XPath query processing and beyond,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Jianzhong Li; Xianmin Liu,Abstract This article proposes algorithms for evaluating XPath queries over an XML tree thatis partitioned horizontally and vertically; and is distributed across a number of sites. The keyidea is based on partial evaluation: it is to send the whole query to each site that partiallyevaluates the query; in parallel; and sends the results as compact (Boolean) functions to acoordinator that combines these to obtain the result. This approach possesses the followingperformance guarantees. First; each site is visited at most twice for data-selecting XPathqueries; and only once for Boolean XPath queries. Second; the network traffic is determinedby the answer to the query; rather than the size of the tree. Third; the total computation iscomparable to that of centralized algorithms on the tree stored in a single site; regardless ofhow the tree is fragmented and distributed. We also present a MapReduce algorithm for …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,31
Approaches to exploring category information for question retrieval in community question-answer archives,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen; Quan Yuan,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) is a popular type of service where users askquestions and where answers are obtained from other users or from historical question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchyof categories. As an essential function of CQA services; question retrieval in a CQA archiveaims to retrieve historical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. Thisarticle presents several new approaches to exploiting the category information of questionsfor improving the performance of question retrieval; and it applies these approaches toexisting question retrieval models; including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model.Experiments conducted on real CQA data demonstrate that the proposed techniques areeffective and efficient and are capable of outperforming a variety of baseline methods …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2012,31
Efficient algorithms for answering the m-closest keywords query,Tao Guo; Xin Cao; Gao Cong,Abstract As an important type of spatial keyword query; the m-closest keywords (mCK) queryfinds a group of objects such that they cover all query keywords and have the smallestdiameter; which is defined as the largest distance between any pair of objects in the group.The query is useful in many applications such as detecting locations of web resources.However; the existing work does not study the intractability of this problem and only providesexact algorithms; which are computationally expensive. In this paper; we prove that theproblem of answering mCK queries is NP-hard. We first devise a greedy algorithm that hasan approximation ratio of 2. Then; we observe that an mCK query can be approximatelyanswered by finding the circle with the smallest diameter that encloses a group of objectstogether covering all query keywords. We prove that the group enclosed in the circle can …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,30
Retrieving regions of interest for user exploration,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract We consider an application scenario where points of interest (PoIs) each have aweb presence and where a web user wants to identify a region that contains relevant PoIsthat are relevant to a set of keywords; eg; in preparation for deciding where to go toconveniently explore the PoIs. Motivated by this; we propose the length-constrainedmaximum-sum region (LCMSR) query that returns a spatial-network region that is locatedwithin a general region of interest; that does not exceed a given size constraint; and that bestmatches query keywords. Such a query maximizes the total weight of the PoIs in it wrt thequery keywords. We show that it is NP-hard to answer this query. We develop anapproximation algorithm with a (5+ ε) approximation ratio utilizing a technique that scalesnode weights into integers. We also propose a more efficient heuristic algorithm and a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,28
On the complexity of view update analysis and its application to annotation propagation,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Jizhou Luo,This paper investigates three problems identified in [1] for annotation propagation; namely;the view side-effect; source side-effect; and annotation placement problems. Givenannotations entered for a tuple or an attribute in a view; these problems ask what tuples orattributes in the source have to be annotated to produce the view annotations. As observedin [1]; these problems are fundamental not only for data provenance but also for themanagement of view updates. For an annotation attached to a single existing tuple in a view;it has been shown that these problems are often intractable even for views defined in termsof simple SPJU queries [1]. We revisit these problems by considering severaldichotomies:(1) views defined in various subclasses of SPJU; versus SPJU views under apractical key preserving condition;(2) annotations attached to existing tuples in a view …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,28

Incidentally; E-mail messages can be modelled as semi-structured documents consisting of a set of fieldswith pre-defined semantics and a number of variable length free-text fields. Our proposedmethod deals with both fields having pre-defined semantics as well as variable length free-text fields for obtaining higher accuracy. The main contributions of this work are two-fold.First; we present a new model based on the Neural Network (NN) for classifying personal E-mails. In particular; we treat E-mail files as a particular kind of plain text files; the implicationbeing that our feature set is relatively large (since there are thousands of different terms indifferent E-mail files). Second; we propose the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,28
Efficient algorithms and cost models for reverse spatial-keyword k-nearest neighbor search,Ying Lu; Jiaheng Lu; Gao Cong; Wei Wu; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Geographic objects associated with descriptive texts are becoming prevalent;justifying the need for spatial-keyword queries that consider both locations and textualdescriptions of the objects. Specifically; the relevance of an object to a query is measured byspatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textual similarity. In thisarticle; we introduce the Reverse Spatial-Keyword k-Nearest Neighbor (RSKkNN) query;which finds those objects that have the query as one of their k-nearest spatial-textualobjects. The RSKkNN queries have numerous applications in online maps and GIS decisionsupport systems. To answer RSKkNN queries efficiently; we propose a hybrid index tree;called IUR-tree (Intersection-Union R-tree) that effectively combines location proximity withtextual similarity. Subsequently; we design a branch-and-bound search algorithm based …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,26
Author name disambiguation using a new categorical distribution similarity,Shaohua Li; Gao Cong; Chunyan Miao,Abstract Author name ambiguity has been a long-standing problem which impairs theaccuracy of publication retrieval and bibliometric methods. Most of the existingdisambiguation methods are built on similarity measures; eg;“Jaccard Coefficient”; betweentwo sets of papers to be disambiguated; each set represented by a set of categoricalfeatures; eg; coauthors and published venues. Such measures perform bad when the twosets are small; which is typical in Author Name Disambiguation. In this paper; we propose anovel categorical set similarity measure. We model an author's preference; eg; to venues;using a categorical distribution; and derive a likelihood ratio to estimate the likelihood thatthe two sets are drawn from the same distribution. This likelihood ratio is used as thesimilarity measure to decide whether two sets belong to the same author. This measure is …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2012,26

Existing works have focused on the selectivityestimation of XML queries without order-based axes. In this work; we develop a frameworkto estimate the result sizes of XPath expressions with order-based axes. We describe howthe path and order information of XML elements can be captured and summarized incompact data structures. We also describe methods to estimate the selectivity of XPathqueries.

Incremental maintenance of quotient cube for median,Cuiping Li; Gao Cong; Anthony KH Tung; Shan Wang,Abstract Data cube pre-computation is an important concept for supporting OLAP (OnlineAnalytical Processing) and has been studied extensively. It is often not feasible to compute acomplete data cube due to the huge storage requirement. Recently proposed quotient cubeaddressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalencepartitions. Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such asSUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN. Maintaining adata cube for holistic aggregation is a hard problem since its difficulty lies in the fact thathistory tuple values must be kept in order to compute the new aggregate when tuples areinserted or deleted. The quotient cube makes the problem harder since we also need tomaintain the equivalence classes. In this paper; we introduce two techniques called …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,26
SAR: A sentiment-aspect-region model for user preference analysis in geo-tagged reviews,Kaiqi Zhao; Gao Cong; Quan Yuan; Kenny Q Zhu,Many location based services; such as FourSquare; Yelp; TripAdvisor; Google Places; etc.;allow users to compose reviews or tips on points of interest (POIs); each having ageographical coordinates. These services have accumulated a large amount of such geo-tagged review data; which allows deep analysis of user preferences in POIs. This paperstudies two types of user preferences to POIs: topical-region preference and category awaretopical-aspect preference. We propose a unified probabilistic model to capture these twopreferences simultaneously. In addition; our model is capable of capturing the interaction ofdifferent factors; including topical aspect; sentiment; and spatial information. The model canbe used in a number of applications; such as POI recommendation and userrecommendation; among others. In addition; the model enables us to investigate whether …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,25
Exploring domain-specific term weight in archived question search,Zhao-Yan Ming; Tat-Seng Chua; Gao Cong,Abstract Community Question Answering services; eg; Yahoo!

Aneffective question retrieval model is essential to increase the accessibility of the QA archives.QA archives are usually organized into categories and question search can be performedwithin the whole collection or within a certain category.. In this paper; we explore domain-specific term weight for archived question search. Specifically; we propose a novel light-weighted term weighting scheme that exploits multiple aspects of the domain information.We also introduce a framework to seamlessly integrate domain-specific term weight into theexisting retrieval models.

Efficient algorithm for computing link-based similarity in real world networks,Yuanzhe Cai; Gao Cong; Xu Jia; Hongyan Liu; Jun He; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaoyong Du,Similarity calculation has many applications; such as information retrieval; and collaborativefiltering; among many others. It has been shown that link-based similarity measure; such asSimRank; is very effective in characterizing the object similarities in networks; such as theWeb; by exploiting the object-to-object relationship. Unfortunately; it is prohibitivelyexpensive to compute the link-based similarity in a relatively large graph. In this paper;based on the observation that link-based similarity scores of real world graphs follow thepower-law distribution; we propose a new approximate algorithm; namely Power-SimRank;with guaranteed error bound to efficiently compute link-based similarity measure.

Semi-supervised text classification using partitioned em,Gao Cong; Wee Lee; Haoran Wu; Bing Liu,Abstract Text classification using a small labeled set and a large unlabeled data is seen as apromising technique to reduce the labor-intensive and time consuming effort of labelingtraining data in order to build accurate classifiers since unlabeled data is easy to get fromthe Web. In [16] it has been demonstrated that an unlabeled set improves classificationaccuracy significantly with only a small labeled training set. However; the Bayesian methodused in [16] assumes that text documents are generated from a mixture model and there is aone-to-one correspondence between the mixture components and the classes. This may notbe the case in many applications. In many real-life applications; a class may coverdocuments from many different topics; which violates the one-to-one correspondenceassumption. In such cases; the resulting classifiers can be quite poor. In this paper; we …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,23
Efficient processing of spatial group keyword queries,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Tao Guo; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging techniques; spatio-textualobjects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining inprevalence; and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual descriptionare gaining in prominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on findingindividual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where theobjects in a group together satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group ofspatio-textual objects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and suchthat the objects are nearest to the query location and have the smallest inter-objectdistances. Specifically; we study three instantiations of this problem; all of which are NP-hard.

Diversity-aware top-k publish/subscribe for text stream,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong,Abstract Massive amount of text data are being generated by a huge number of web users atan unprecedented scale. These data cover a wide range of topics. Users are interested inreceiving a few up-to-date representative documents (eg; tweets) that can provide them witha wide coverage of different aspects of their query topics. To address the problem; weconsider the Diversity-Aware Top-k Subscription (DAS) query. Given a DAS query; wecontinuously maintain an up-to-date result set that contains k most recently returneddocuments over a text stream for the query. The DAS query takes into account textrelevance; document recency; and result diversity. We propose a novel solution to efficientlyprocessing a large number of DAS queries over a stream of documents.

On Information Coverage for Location Category Based Point-of-Interest Recommendation.,Xuefeng Chen; Yifeng Zeng; Gao Cong; Shengchao Qin; Yanping Xiang; Yuanshun Dai,Abstract Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation becomes a valuable service in location-based social networks. Based on the norm that similar users are likely to have similarpreference of POIs; the current recommendation techniques mainly focus on users'preference to provide accurate recommendation results. This tends to generate a list ofhomogeneous POIs that are clustered into a narrow band of location categories (like food;museum; etc.) in a city. However; users are more interested to taste a wide range of flavorsthat are exposed in a global set of location categories in the city. In this paper; we formulatea new POI recommendation problem; namely top-K location category based POIrecommendation; by introducing information coverage to encode the location categories ofPOIs in a city. The problem is NP-hard. We develop a greedy algorithm and further …,AAAI,2015,22
Updating recursive XML views of relations,Byron Choi; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Stratis D Viglas,This paper investigates the view update problem for XML views published from relationaldata. We consider (possibly) recursively defined XML views; compressed into DAGs andstored in relations. We provide new techniques to efficiently support XML view updatesspecified in terms of XFath expressions with recursion and complex filters. The interactionbetween XFath recursion and DAG compression of XML views makes the analysis of XMLview updates intriguing. Furthermore; many issues are still open even for relational viewupdates; and need to be explored. In response to these; we revise the update semantics toaccommodate XML side effects based on the semantics of XML views; and present efficientalgorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates. Moreover; we propose amild condition on SPJ views; and show that under this condition the analysis of deletions …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,22
Distributed Spatial Keyword Querying on Road Networks.,Siqiang Luo; Yifeng Luo; Shuigeng Zhou; Gao Cong; Jihong Guan; Zheng Yong,ABSTRACT Spatial-keyword queries on road networks are receiving increasing attentionwith the prominence of location-based services. There is a growing need to handle querieson road networks in distributed environments because a large network is typically distributedover multiple machines and it will improve query throughput. However; all the existing workon spatial keyword queries is based on a centralized setting. In this paper; we develop adistributed solution to answering spatial keyword queries on road networks. Examplequeries include “find locations near a supermarket and a hospital;” and “find Chineserestaurants within 500 meters from my current location.” We define an operation foranswering such queries and reduce the problem of answering a query into computing afunction of such operations. We propose a new distributed index that enables each …,EDBT,2014,21
Efficient spatial keyword search in trajectory databases,Gao Cong; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: An increasing amount of trajectory data is being annotated with text descriptions tobetter capture the semantics associated with locations. The fusion of spatial locations andtext descriptions in trajectories engenders a new type of top-$ k $ queries that take intoaccount both aspects. Each trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatiallocations associated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\lambda $ and a keywordset $\psi $; a top-$ k $ query returns $ k $ trajectories whose text descriptions cover thekeywords $\psi $ and that have the shortest match distance. To the best of our knowledge;previous research on querying trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data withoutany text description; and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$ k $ queries ontrajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing top-$ k …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2880,2012,20
Querying XML with update syntax,Wenfei Fan; Gao Cong; Philip Bohannon,Abstract This paper investigates a class of transform queries proposed by XQuery Update[6]. A transform query is defined in terms of XML update syntax. When posed on an XML treeT; it returns another XML tree that would be produced by executing its embedded update onT; without destructive impact on T. Transform queries support a variety of applicationsincluding XML hypothetical queries; the simulation of updates on virtual views; and theenforcement of XML access control. In light of the wide-range of applications for transformqueries; we develop automaton-based techniques for efficiently evaluating transformqueries and for computing their compositions with user queries in standard XQuery. Weprovide (a) three algorithms to implement transform queries without change to existingXQuery processors;(b) a linear-time algorithm; based on a seamless integration of …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,20

Content-enriched classifier for web video classification,Bin Cui; Ce Zhang; Gao Cong,Abstract With the explosive growth of online videos; automatic real-time categorization ofWeb videos plays a key role for organizing; browsing and retrieving the huge amount ofvideos on the Web. Previous work shows that; in addition to text features; content features ofvideos are also useful for Web video classification. Unfortunately; extracting content featuresis computationally prohibitive for real-time video classification. In this paper we propose anovel video classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text features forvideo classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content featuresat classification time. The main idea of our approach is to utilize the content featuresextracted from training data to enrich the text based semantic kernels; yielding content-enriched semantic kernels. The content-enriched semantic kernels enable to utilize both …,Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2010,18
Exploring composite acoustic features for efficient music similarity query,Bin Cui; Jialie Shen; Gao Cong; Heng Tao Shen; Cui Yu,Abstract Music similarity query based on acoustic content is becoming important with theever-increasing growth of the music information from emerging applications such as digitallibraries and WWW. However; relative techniques are still in their infancy and much lessthan satisfactory. In this paper; we present a novel index structure; called Composite Featuretree; CF-tree; to facilitate efficient content-based music search adopting multiple musicalfeatures. Before constructing the tree structure; we use PCA to transform the extractedfeatures into a new space sorted by the importance of acoustic features. The CF-tree is abalanced multi-way tree structure where each level represents the data space at differentdimensionalities. The PCA transformed data and reduced dimensions in the upper levelscan alleviate suffering from dimensionality curse.

Go green: recycle and reuse frequent patterns,Gao Cong; Beng Chin Ooi; K-L Tan; Anthony KH Tung,In constrained data mining; users can specify constraints to prune the search space to avoidmining uninteresting knowledge. This is typically done by specifying some initial values ofthe constraints that are subsequently refined iteratively until satisfactory results are obtained.Existing mining schemes treat each iteration as a distinct mining process; and fail to exploitthe information generated between iterations. We propose to salvage knowledge that isdiscovered from an earlier iteration of mining to enhance subsequent rounds of mining. Inparticular; we look at how frequent patterns can be recycled. Our proposed strategy operatesin two phases. In the first phase; frequent patterns obtained from an early iteration are usedto compress a database. In the second phase; subsequent mining processes operate on thecompressed database. We propose two compression strategies and adapt three existing …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Effective and efficient clustering methods for correlated probabilistic graphs,Yu Gu; Chunpeng Gao; Gao Cong; Ge Yu,Recently; probabilistic graphs have attracted significant interests of the data miningcommunity. It is observed that correlations may exist among adjacent edges in variousprobabilistic graphs. As one of the basic mining techniques; graph clustering is widely usedin exploratory data analysis; such as data compression; information retrieval; imagesegmentation; etc. Graph clustering aims to divide data into clusters according to theirsimilarities; and a number of algorithms have been proposed for clustering graphs; such asthe pKwikCluster algorithm; spectral clustering; k-path clustering; etc. However; littleresearch has been performed to develop efficient clustering algorithms for probabilisticgraphs. Particularly; it becomes more challenging to efficiently cluster probabilistic graphswhen correlations are considered.

Centroid-based actionable 3D subspace clustering,Kelvin Sim; Ghim-Eng Yap; David R Hardoon; Vivekanand Gopalkrishnan; Gao Cong; Suryani Lukman,Actionable 3D subspace clustering from real-world continuous-valued 3D (ie; object-attribute-context) data promises tangible benefits such as discovery of biologically significantprotein residues and profitable stocks; but existing algorithms are inadequate in solving thisclustering problem; most of them are not actionable (ability to suggest profitable or beneficialactions to users); do not allow incorporation of domain knowledge; and are parametersensitive; ie; the wrong threshold setting reduces the cluster quality. Moreover; its 3Dstructure complicates this clustering problem.

KORS: Keyword-aware optimal route search system,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Jihong Guan; Nhan-Tue Phan; Xiaokui Xiao,We present the Keyword-aware Optimal Route Search System (KORS); which efficientlyanswers the KOR queries. A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint is satisfied; and an objective score of theroute is optimized. Consider a tourist who wants to spend a day exploring a city. The usermay issue the following KOR query:“find the most popular route such that it passes byshopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4hours.” KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers andprovides a client application for mobile devices as well. The interfaces and the client enableusers to formulate queries and view the query results on a map. Queries are then sent to theserver for processing by the HTTP post operation. Since answering a KOR query is NP …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,13
Updating recursive XML views of relations,Byron Choi; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Stratis D Viglas,Abstract This paper investigates the view update problem for XML views published fromrelational data. We consider XML views defined in terms of mappings directed by possiblyrecursive DTDs compressed into DAGs and stored in relations. We provide new techniquesto efficiently support XML view updates specified in terms of XPath expressions withrecursion and complex filters. The interaction between XPath recursion and DAGcompression of XML views makes the analysis of the XML view update problem ratherintriguing. Furthermore; many issues are still open even for relational view updates; andneed to be explored. In response to these; on the XML side; we revise the notion of sideeffects and update semantics based on the semantics of XML views; and present effecientalgorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates.

PRED: Periodic region detection for mobility modeling of social media users,Quan Yuan; Wei Zhang; Chao Zhang; Xinhe Geng; Gao Cong; Jiawei Han,Abstract The availability of massive geo-annotated social media data sheds light on studyinghuman mobility patterns. Among them; periodic pattern;\ie an individual visiting ageographical region with some specific time interval; has been recognized as one of themost important. Mining periodic patterns has a variety of applications; such as locationprediction; anomaly detection; and location-and time-aware recommendation. However; it isa challenging task: the regions of a person and the periods of each region are bothunknown. The interdependency between them makes the task even harder. Hence; existingmethods are far from satisfactory for detecting periodic patterns from the low-sampling andnoisy social media data. We propose a Bayesian non-parametric model; named\textbf {P}eriodic\textbf {RE} gion\textbf {D} etection (PRED); to discover periodic mobility patterns …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,12
Joint recognition and linking of fine-grained locations from tweets,Zongcheng Ji; Aixin Sun; Gao Cong; Jialong Han,Abstract Many users casually reveal their locations such as restaurants; landmarks; andshops in their tweets. Recognizing such fine-grained locations from tweets and then linkingthe location mentions to well-defined location profiles (eg; with formal name; detailedaddress; and geo-coordinates etc.) offer a tremendous opportunity for many applications.Different from existing solutions which perform location recognition and linking as two sub-tasks sequentially in a pipeline setting; in this paper; we propose a novel joint framework toperform location recognition and location linking simultaneously in a joint search space. Weformulate this end-to-end location linking problem as a structured prediction problem andpropose a beam-search based algorithm.

A Tri-Role Topic Model for Domain-Specific Question Answering.,Zongyang Ma; Aixin Sun; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong,Abstract Stack Overflow and MedHelp are examples of domainspecific community-basedquestion answering (CQA) systems. Different from CQA systems for general topics (eg;Yahoo! Answers; Baidu Knows); questions and answers in domain-specific CQA systemsare mostly in the same topical domain; enabling more comprehensive interaction betweenusers on fine-grained topics. In such systems; users are more likely to ask questions onunfamiliar topics and to answer questions matching their expertise. Users can also voteanswers based on their judgements. In this paper; we propose a Tri-Role Topic Model(TRTM) to model the tri-roles of users (ie; as askers; answerers; and voters; respectively)and the activities of each role including composing question; selecting question to answer;contributing and voting answers. The proposed model can be used to enhance CQA …,AAAI,2015,12
Influence Maximization with Novelty Decay in Social Networks.,Shanshan Feng; Xuefeng Chen; Gao Cong; Yifeng Zeng; Yeow Meng Chee; Yanping Xiang,Abstract Influence maximization problem is to find a set of seed nodes in a social networksuch that their influence spread is maximized under certain propagation models. A fewalgorithms have been proposed for solving this problem. However; they have not consideredthe impact of novelty decay on influence propagation; ie; repeated exposures will havediminishing influence on users. In this paper; we consider the problem of influencemaximization with novelty decay (IMND). We investigate the effect of novelty decay oninfluence propagation on real-life datasets and formulate the IMND problem. We furtheranalyze the problem properties and propose an influence estimation technique. Wedemonstrate the performance of our algorithms on four social networks.,AAAI,2014,12
Where your photo is taken: Geolocation prediction for social images,Bo Liu; Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Dong Xu,Abstract Social image-sharing websites have attracted a large number of users. Thesesystems allow users to associate geolocation information with their images; which isessential for many interesting applications. However; only a small fraction of social imageshave geolocation information. Thus; an automated tool for suggesting geolocation isessential to help users geotag their images. In this article; we use a large data set consistingof 221 million Flickr images uploaded by 2.2 million users. For the first time; we analyze useruploading patterns; user geotagging behaviors; and the relationship between the taken-timegap and the geographical distance between two images from the same user. Based on thefindings; we represent a user profile by historical tags for the user and build a multinomialmodel on the user profile for geotagging.

Coarse-to-fine review selection via supervised joint aspect and sentiment model,Zhen Hai; Gao Cong; Kuiyu Chang; Wenting Liu; Peng Cheng,Abstract Online reviews are immensely valuable for customers to make informed purchasedecisions and for businesses to improve the quality of their products and services. However;customer reviews grow exponentially while varying greatly in quality. It is generally verytedious and difficult; if not impossible; for users to read though the huge amount of reviewdata. Fortunately; review quality evaluation enables a system to select the most helpfulreviews for users' decision-making. Previous studies predict only the overall review utilityabout a product; and often focus on developing different data features to learn a qualityfunction for addressing the problem. In this paper; we aim to select the most helpful reviewsnot only at the product level; but also at a fine-grained product aspect level.

Overlapping decomposition for causal graphical modeling,Lei Han; Guojie Song; Gao Cong; Kunqing Xie,Abstract Causal graphical models are developed to detect the dependence relationshipsbetween random variables and provide intuitive explanations for the relationships incomplex systems. Most of existing work focuses on learning a single graphical model for allthe variables. However; a single graphical model cannot accurately characterize thecomplicated causal relationships for a relatively large graph. In this paper; we propose theproblem of estimating an overlapping decomposition for Gaussian graphical models of alarge scale to generate overlapping sub-graphical models. Specifically; we formulate anobjective function for the overlapping decomposition problem and propose an approximatealgorithm for it. A key theory of the algorithm is that the problem of solving a κ+ 1 nodegraphical model can be reduced to the problem of solving a one-step regularization …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,11
Evolutionary taxonomy construction from dynamic tag space,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Gao Cong; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites; facilitatingordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags andtheir relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space; the popularity and correlationamongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords anddifficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumptionrelationships; automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to managecollaborative tags. However; tags change over time; and it is also imperative to incorporatethe temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper; we formalize theproblem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line oftaxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space.

Evolutionary taxonomy construction from dynamic tag space,Bin Cui; Junjie Yao; Gao Cong; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Collaborative tagging allows users to tag online resources. We refer to the largedatabase of tags and their relationships as a tag space. In a tag space; the popularity andcorrelation amongst tags capture the current social interests; and taxonomy is a useful wayto organize these tags. As tags change over time; it is imperative to incorporate the temporaltag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper; we formalize the problem of evolutionarytaxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomyframework consists of two key features.

Semantic mining and analysis of gene expression data,Xin Xu; Gao Cong; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Association rules can reveal biological relevant relationship between genes andenvironments/categories. However; most existing association rule mining algorithms arerendered impractical on gene expression data; which typically contains thousands or tens ofthousands of columns (gene expression levels); but only tens of rows (samples). The mainproblem is that these algorithms have an exponential dependence on the number ofcolumns. Another shortcoming is evident that too many associations are generated fromsuch kind of data. To this end; we have developed a novel depth-first row-wise algorithmFARMER [2] that is specially designed to efficiently discover and cluster association rulesinto interesting rule groups (IRGs) that satisfy user-specified minimum support; confidenceand chi-square value thresholds on biological datasets as opposed to finding association …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,10

Itallows users to take photos; apply digital filters and share them with friends instantaneouslyby using mobile devices. Instagram provides users with the functionality to associate theirphotos with points of interest; and it thus becomes feasible to study the association betweenpoints of interest and Instagram photos. However; no previous work studies the association.In this paper; we propose to study the problem of mapping Instagram photos to points ofinterest.

Category hierarchy maintenance: a data-driven approach,Quan Yuan; Gao Cong; Aixin Sun; Chin-Yew Lin; Nadia Magnenat Thalmann,Abstract Category hierarchies often evolve at a much slower pace than the documentsreside in. With newly available documents kept adding into a hierarchy; new topics emergeand documents within the same category become less topically cohesive. In this paper; wepropose a novel automatic approach to modifying a given category hierarchy byredistributing its documents into more topically cohesive categories. The modification isachieved with three operations (namely; sprout; merge; and assign) with reference to anauxiliary hierarchy for additional semantic information; the auxiliary hierarchy covers asimilar set of topics as the hierarchy to be modified. Our user study shows that the modifiedcategory hierarchy is semantically meaningful. As an extrinsic evaluation; we conductexperiments on document classification using real data from Yahoo!

A general recommendation model for heterogeneous networks,Tuan-Anh Nguyen Pham; Xutao Li; Gao Cong; Zhenjie Zhang,Heterogeneous networks refer to the networks comprising multiple types of entities as wellas their interaction relationships. They arise in a great variety of domains; for example; event-based social networks Meetup and Plancast; and DBLP. Recommendation is a useful task inthese heterogeneous network systems. Although many recommendation algorithms areproposed for heterogeneous data; none of them is able to explicitly model the influencestrength between different types of entities; which is useful not only for achieving higherrecommendation accuracy but also better understanding the role of each entity type inrecommendation problems. Moreover; many of those algorithms are designed for aparticular task; and hence it is challenging to apply them in other problems.

Maximizing influence under influence loss constraint in social networks,Yifeng Zeng; Xuefeng Chen; Gao Cong; Shengchao Qin; Jing Tang; Yanping Xiang,Abstract Influence maximization is a fundamental research problem in social networks. Viralmarketing; one of its applications; aims to select a small set of users to adopt a product; sothat the word-of-mouth effect can subsequently trigger a large cascade of further adoption insocial networks. The problem of influence maximization is to select a set of K nodes from asocial network so that the spread of influence is maximized over the network. Previousresearch on mining top-K influential nodes assumes that all of the selected K nodes canpropagate the influence as expected. However; some of the selected nodes may not functionwell in practice; which leads to influence loss of top-K nodes. In this paper; we study analternative influence maximization problem which is naturally motivated by the reliabilityconstraint of nodes in social networks. We aim to find top-K influential nodes given a …,Expert Systems with Applications,2016,7
Learning to find topic experts in Twitter via different relations,Wei Wei; Gao Cong; Chunyan Miao; Feida Zhu; Guohui Li,Expert finding has become a hot topic along with the flourishing of social networks; such asmicro-blogging services like Twitter. Finding experts in Twitter is an important problembecause tweets from experts are valuable sources that carry rich information (eg; trends) invarious domains. However; previous methods cannot be directly applied to Twitter expertfinding problem. Recently; several attempts use the relations among users and Twitter Listsfor expert finding. Nevertheless; these approaches only partially utilize such relations. Tothis end; we develop a probabilistic method to jointly exploit three types of relations (ie;follower relation; user-list relation; and list-list relation) for finding experts. Specifically; wepropose a Semi-Supervised Graph-based Ranking approach (SSGR) to offline calculate theglobal authority of users. In SSGR; we employ a normalized Laplacian regularization term …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,7

MR-NTD: manifold regularization nonnegative tucker decomposition for tensor data dimension reduction and representation,Xutao Li; Michael K Ng; Gao Cong; Yunming Ye; Qingyao Wu,With the advancement of data acquisition techniques; tensor (multidimensional data) objectsare increasingly accumulated and generated; for example; multichannelelectroencephalographies; multiview images; and videos. In these applications; the tensorobjects are usually nonnegative; since the physical signals are recorded. As thedimensionality of tensor objects is often very high; a dimension reduction techniquebecomes an important research topic of tensor data. From the perspective of geometry; high-dimensional objects often reside in a low-dimensional submanifold of the ambient space. Inthis paper; we propose a new approach to perform the dimension reduction for nonnegativetensor objects.

An association-based unified framework for mining features and opinion words,Zhen Hai; Kuiyu Chang; Gao Cong; Christopher C Yang,Abstract Mining features and opinion words is essential for fine-grained opinion analysis ofcustomer reviews. It is observed that semantic dependencies naturally exist betweenfeatures and opinion words; even among features or opinion words themselves. In thisarticle; we employ a corpus statistics association measure to quantify the pairwise worddependencies and propose a generalized association-based unified framework to identifyfeatures; including explicit and implicit features; and opinion words from reviews. We firstextract explicit features and opinion words via an association-based bootstrapping method(ABOOT).

Integrating Community Question and Answer Archives.,Wei Wei; Gao Cong; Xiaoli Li; See-Kiong Ng; Guohui Li,Abstract Question and answer pairs in Community Question Answering (CQA) services areorganized into hierarchical structures or taxonomies to facilitate users to find the answers fortheir questions conveniently. We observe that different CQA services have their ownknowledge focus and used different taxonomies to organize their question and answer pairsin their archives. As there are no simple semantic mappings between the taxonomies of theCQA services; the integration of CQA services is a challenging task. The existingapproaches on integrating taxonomies ignore the hierarchical structures of the sourcetaxonomy. In this paper; we propose a novel approach that is capable of incorporating theparent-child and sibling information in the hierarchical structures of the source taxonomy foraccurate taxonomy integration.

The huge number of discovered frequent patterns pose great challenge forusers to explore and understand them. It is desirable to accurately summarizing the set offrequent patterns into a small number of patterns or profiles so that users can easily explorethem. In this paper; we employ a probability model to represent a set of frequent patternsand give two methods of estimating the support of a pattern from the model. Based on themodel; we develop an approach to grouping a set of frequent patterns into k profiles and thesupport of frequent pattern can be estimated fairly accurately from a relative small number ofprofiles.

Proxies for shortest path and distance queries,Shuai Ma; Kaiyu Feng; Jianxin Li; Haixun Wang; Gao Cong; Jinpeng Huai,Computing shortest paths and distances is one of the fundamental problems on graphs; andit remains a challenging task today. This article investigates a light-weight data reductiontechnique for speeding-up shortest path and distance queries on large graphs. To do this;we propose a notion of routing proxies (or simply proxies); each of which represents a smallsubgraph; referred to as deterministic routing areas (DRAs). We first show that routingproxies hold good properties for speeding-up shortest path and distance queries. Then; wedesign a linear-time algorithm to compute routing proxies and their corresponding DRAs.Finally; we experimentally verify that our solution is a general technique for reducing graphsizes and speeding-up shortest path and distance queries; using real-life large graphs.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,5

Extracting representative motion flows for effective video retrieval,Zhe Zhao; Bin Cui; Gao Cong; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel motion-based video retrieval approach to finddesired videos from video databases through trajectory matching. The main component ofour approach is to extract representative motion features from the video; which could bebroken down to the following three steps. First; we extract the motion vectors from eachframe of videos and utilize Harris corner points to compensate the effect of the cameramotion. Second; we find interesting motion flows from frames using sliding windowmechanism and a clustering algorithm. Third; we merge the generated motion flows andselect representative ones to capture the motion features of videos. Furthermore; we designa symbolic based trajectory matching method for effective video retrieval. The experimentalresults show that our algorithm is capable to effectively extract motion flows with high …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2012,5
PRATA: A system for XML publishing; integration and view maintenance,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Xibei Jia; Shuai Ma,Abstract We present PRATA; a system that supports the following in a uniform framework:(a)XML publishing; ie; converting data from databases to an XML document;(b) XMLintegration; ie; extracting data from multiple; distributed databases; and integrating the datainto a single XML document; and (c) incremental maintenance of published or integratedXML data (view); ie; in response to changes to the source databases; efficiently propagatingthe source changes to the XML view by computing the corresponding XML changes. Asalient feature of the system is that publishing; integration and view maintenance areschema-directed: they are conducted strictly following a user-specified (possibly recursiveand complex) XML schema; and guarantee that the generated or modified XML documentconforms to the predefined schema.

Annotating points of interest with geo-tagged tweets,Kaiqi Zhao; Gao Cong; Aixin Sun,Abstract Microblogging services like Twitter contain abundant of user generated contentcovering a wide range of topics. Many of the tweets can be associated to real-world entitiesfor providing additional information for the latter. In this paper; we aim to associate tweetsthat are semantically related to real-world locations or Points of Interest (POIs). Tweetscontain dynamic and real-time information while POIs contain relatively static information.The tweets associated with POIs provide complementary information for many applicationslike opinion mining and POI recommendation; the associated POIs can also be used as POItags in Twitter. We define the research problem of annotating POIs with tweets and proposea novel supervised Bayesian Model (sBM). The model takes into account the textual; spatialfeatures and user behaviors together with the supervised information of whether a tweet …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,4
Analyzing Sentiments in One Go: A Supervised Joint Topic Modeling Approach,Zhen Hai; Gao Cong; Kuiyu Chang; Peng Cheng; Chunyan Miao,In this work; we focus on modeling user-generated review and overall rating pairs; and aimto identify semantic aspects and aspect-level sentiments from review data as well as topredict overall sentiments of reviews. We propose a novel probabilistic supervised jointaspect and sentiment model (SJASM) to deal with the problems in one go under a unifiedframework. SJASM represents each review document in the form of opinion pairs; and cansimultaneously model aspect terms and corresponding opinion words of the review forhidden aspect and sentiment detection. It also leverages sentimental overall ratings; whichoften come with online reviews; as supervision data; and can infer the semantic aspects andaspect-level sentiments that are not only meaningful but also predictive of overall sentimentsof reviews. Moreover; we also develop efficient inference method for parameter …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,3
A general model for out-of-town region recommendation,Tuan-Anh Nguyen Pham; Xutao Li; Gao Cong,Abstract With the rapid growth of location-based social networks (LBSNs); it is now availableto analyze and understand user mobility behavior in real world. Studies show that usersusually visit nearby points of interest (POIs); located in small regions; especially when theytravel out of their hometowns. However; previous out-of-town recommendation systemsmainly focus on recommending individual POIs that may reside far from each other; whichmakes the recommendation results less useful. In this paper; we introduce a novel problemcalled Region Recommendation; which aims to recommend an out-of-town region of POIsthat are likely to be visited by a user. The proximity characteristic of user mobility behaviorimplies that the probability of visiting one POI depends on those of nearby POIs. Thus; tomake accurate region recommendation; our proposed model exploits the influence …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,3
POI2Vec: Geographical Latent Representation for Predicting Future Visitors.,Shanshan Feng; Gao Cong; Bo An; Yeow Meng Chee,Abstract With the increasing popularity of location-aware social media applications; Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has recently been extensively studied. However; most of theexisting studies explore from the users' perspective; namely recommending POIs for users.In contrast; we consider a new research problem of predicting users who will visit a givenPOI in a given future period. The challenge of the problem lies in the difficulty to effectivelylearn POI sequential transition and user preference; and integrate them for prediction. In thiswork; we propose a new latent representation model POI2Vec that is able to incorporate thegeographical influence; which has been shown to be very important in modeling usermobility behavior. Note that existing representation models fail to incorporate thegeographical influence. We further propose a method to jointly model the user preference …,AAAI,2017,3
Efficient processing of location-aware group preference queries,Miao Li; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Yu Gu; Ge Yu,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning techniques that enable users to acquiretheir geographical positions; there has been increasing popularity of online location-basedservices. This development has generated a large volume of points of interest labeled withcategory features (eg; hotel; resort; stores; stations; and tourist attractions). It givesprominence to various types of spatial-keyword queries; which are employed to providefundamental querying functionality for location-based services. We study the Location-awareGroup Preference (LGP) query that aims to find a destination place for a group of users. Thegroup of users want to go to a place labeled with a specified category feature (eg; hotel)together; and each of them has a location and a set of additional preferences.

DynaDiffuse: A Dynamic Diffusion Model for Continuous Time Constrained Influence Maximization.,Miao Xie; Qiusong Yang; Qing Wang; Gao Cong; Gerard De Melo,Abstract Studying the spread of phenomena in social networks is critical but still not fullysolved. Existing influence maximization models assume a static network; disregarding itsevolution over time. We introduce the continuous time constrained influence maximizationproblem for dynamic diffusion networks; based on a novel diffusion model calledDYNADIFFUSE. Although the problem is NP-hard; the influence spread functions aremonotonic and submodular; enabling fast approximations on top of an innovative stochasticmodel checking approach. Experiments on real social network data show that our modelfinds higher quality solutions and our algorithm outperforms state-of-art alternatives.,AAAI,2015,3
A Revisit of Query Expansion with different semantic levels,Ce Zhang; Bin Cui; Gao Cong; Yu-Jing Wang,Abstract Query expansion has received extensive attention in information retrievalcommunity. Although semantic based query expansion appears to be promising inimproving retrieval performance; previous research has shown that it cannot consistentlyimprove retrieval performance. It is a tricky problem to automatically determine whether to doquery expansion for a given query. In this paper; we introduce Compact Concept Ontology(CCO) and provide users the option of exploring different semantic levels by using differentCCOs. Experimental results show our approach is superior to previous work in many cases.Additionally; we integrate the proposed methods into a text-based video search system(iVSearcher); to improve the user's experience and retrieval performance significantly.

An experimental evaluation of point-of-interest recommendation in location-based social networks,Yiding Liu; Tuan-Anh Nguyen Pham; Gao Cong; Quan Yuan,Abstract Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is an important service to Location-BasedSocial Networks (LBSNs) that can benefit both users and businesses. In recent years; anumber of POI recommender systems have been proposed; but there is still a lack ofsystematical comparison thereof. In this paper; we provide an all-around evaluation of 12state-of-the-art POI recommendation models. From the evaluation; we obtain severalimportant findings; based on which we can better understand and utilize POIrecommendation models in various scenarios. We anticipate this work to provide readerswith an overall picture of the cutting-edge research on POI recommendation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,2
Distributed algorithms on exact personalized pagerank,Tao Guo; Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Jiaheng Lu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract As one of the most well known graph computation problems; PersonalizedPageRank is an effective approach for computing the similarity score between two nodes;and it has been widely used in various applications; such as link prediction andrecommendation. Due to the high computational cost and space cost of computing the exactPersonalized PageRank Vector (PPV); most existing studies compute PPV approximately. Inthis paper; we propose novel and efficient distributed algorithms that compute PPV exactlybased on graph partitioning on a general coordinator-based share-nothing distributedcomputing platform. Our algorithms takes three aspects into account: the load balance; thecommunication cost; and the computation cost of each machine.

Using transactional data from ERP systems for expert finding,Lars K Schunk; Gao Cong,Abstract During the past decade; information retrieval techniques have been augmented inorder to search for experts and not just documents. This is done by searching documentcollections for both query topics and associated experts. A typical approach assumes thatexpert candidates are authors of intranet documents; or that they engage in social writingactivities on blogs or online forums. However; in many organizations; the actual experts; ie;the people who work on problems in their day-to-day work; rarely engage in such writingactivities. As an alternative; we turn to structured corporate data—transactions of workinghours provided by an organization's ERP system—as a source of evidence for rankingexperts. We design an expert finding system for such an enterprise and conclude that it ispossible to utilize such transactional data; which is a result of required daily business …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,2
ISIS: a new approach for efficient similarity search in sparse databases,Bin Cui; Jiakui Zhao; Gao Cong,Abstract High-dimensional sparse data is prevalent in many real-life applications. In thispaper; we propose a novel index structure for accelerating similarity search in high-dimensional sparse databases; named ISIS; which stands for I ndexing S parse databasesusing I nverted file S. ISIS clusters a dataset and converts the original high-dimensionalspace into a new space where each dimension represents a cluster; furthermore; the keyvalues in the new space are used by Inverted-files indexes. We also propose an extensionof ISIS; named ISIS+; which partitions the data space into lower dimensional subspaces andclusters the data within each subspace. Extensive experimental study demonstrates thesuperiority of our approaches in high-dimensional sparse databases.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,2
PANDA: toward partial topology-based search on large networks in a single machine,Miao Xie; Sourav S Bhowmick; Gao Cong; Qing Wang,Abstract A large body of research has focused on efficient and scalable processing ofsubgraph search queries on large networks. In these efforts; a query is posed in the form of aconnected query graph. Unfortunately; in practice end users may not always have preciseknowledge about the topological relationships between nodes in a query graph to formulatea connected query. In this paper; we present a novel graph querying paradigm called partialtopology-based network search and propose a query processing framework called panda toefficiently process partial topology query (ptq) in a single machine. A ptq is a disconnectedquery graph containing multiple connected query components. ptq s allow an end user toformulate queries without demanding precise information about the complete topology of aquery graph.

Heron Inference for Bayesian Graphical Models,Daniel Rugeles; Zhen Hai; Gao Cong; Manoranjan Dash,Abstract: Bayesian graphical models have been shown to be a powerful tool for discoveringuncertainty and causal structure from real-world data in many application fields. Currentinference methods primarily follow different kinds of trade-offs between computationalcomplexity and predictive accuracy. At one end of the spectrum; variational inferenceapproaches perform well in computational efficiency; while at the other end; Gibbs samplingapproaches are known to be relatively accurate for prediction in practice. In this paper; weextend an existing Gibbs sampling method; and propose a new deterministic Heroninference (Heron) for a family of Bayesian graphical models. In addition to the support fornontrivial distributability; one more benefit of Heron is that it is able to not only allow us toeasily assess the convergence status but also largely improve the running efficiency.

Linking Fine-Grained Locations in User Comments,Jialong Han; Aixin Sun; Gao Cong; Wayne Xin Zhao; Zongcheng Ji; Minh C Phan,Many domain-specific websites host a profile page for each entity (eg; locations onFoursquare; movies on IMDb; and products on Amazon) for users to post comments on.When commenting on an entity; users often mention other entities for reference orcomparison. Compared with web pages and tweets; the problem of disambiguating thementioned entities in user comments has not received much attention. This paperinvestigates linking fine-grained locations in Foursquare comments. We demonstrate thatthe focal location; ie; the location that a comment is posted on; provides rich contexts for thelinking task. To exploit such information; we represent the Foursquare data in a graph; whichincludes locations; comments; and their relations. A probabilistic model named FocalLink isproposed to estimate the probability that a user mentions a location when commenting on …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*

For example; the data collected in applications created by Uber or Public TransportAuthorities can be used to plan transportation routes; estimate capacities; and proactivelyidentify low coverage areas. In this paper; we study a new kind of query Reverse k NearestNeighbor Search over Trajectories (RkNNT); which can be used for route planning andcapacity estimation. Given a set of existing routes DR; a set of passenger transitions DT; anda query route Q; an RkNNT query returns all transitions that take Q as one of its k nearesttravel routes. To solve the problem; we first develop an index to handle dynamic trajectoryupdates; so that the most up-to-date transition data are available for answering an RkNNTquery.

Discovering Pollution Sources and Propagation Patterns in Urban Area,Xiucheng Li; Yun Cheng; Gao Cong; Lisi Chen,Abstract Air quality is one of the most important environmental concerns in the world; and ithas deteriorated substantially over the past years in many countries. For example; ChineseAcademy of Social Sciences reports that the problem of haze and fog in China is hitting arecord level; and China is currently suffering from the worst air pollution. Among the variouscausal factors of air quality; particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (ie;PM 2.5) is a very important factor; governments and people are increasingly concerned withthe concentration of PM 2.5. In many cities; stations for monitoring PM 2.5 concentrationhave been built by governments or companies to monitor urban air quality. Apart frommonitoring; there is a rising demand for finding pollution sources of PM 2.5 and discoveringthe transmission of PM 2.5 based on the data from PM $ _ {2.5} $ monitoring stations …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*

A Novel Cascade Model for Learning Latent Similarity from Heterogeneous Sequential Data of MOOC,Zhuoxuan Jiang; Shanshan Feng; Gao Cong; Chunyan Miao; Xiaoming Li,Abstract Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs). With massive learners being offered MOOCs; there is a demand that the forumcontents within MOOCs need to be classified in order to facilitate both learners andinstructors. Therefore we investigate a significant application; which is to associate forumthreads to subtitles of video clips. This task can be regarded as a document rankingproblem; and the key is how to learn a distinguishable text representation from wordsequences and learners' behavior sequences. In this paper; we propose a novel cascademodel; which can capture both the latent semantics and latent similarity by modeling MOOCdata. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our textualrepresentation outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts for the application.,Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2017,*

A system for region search and exploration,Kaiyu Feng; Kaiqi Zhao; Yiding Liu; Gao Cong,Abstract With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and location based services;massive amount of geo-textual data (eg; geo-tagged tweets) is being generated everyday.Compared with traditional spatial data; the textual dimension of geo-textual data greatlyenriches the data. Meanwhile; the spatial dimension of geo-textual data also adds asemantically rich new aspect to textual data.
