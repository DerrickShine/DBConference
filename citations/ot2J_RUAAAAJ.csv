Practical differential privacy via grouping and smoothing,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos,Abstract We address one-time publishing of non-overlapping counts with ε-differentialprivacy. These statistics are useful in a wide and important range of applications; includingtransactional; traffic and medical data analysis. Prior work on the topic publishes suchstatistics with prohibitively low utility in several practical scenarios. Towards this end; wepresent GS; a method that pre-processes the counts by elaborately grouping and smoothingthem via averaging. This step acts as a form of preliminary perturbation that diminishessensitivity; and enables GS to achieve ε-differential privacy through low Laplace noiseinjection. The grouping strategy is dictated by a sampling mechanism; which minimizes thesmoothing perturbation. We demonstrate the superiority of GS over its competitors; andconfirm its practicality; via extensive experiments on real datasets.,Proceedings of the 39th international conference on Very Large Data Bases,2013,58
Differentially private event sequences over infinite streams,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Xiaokui Xiao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Numerous applications require continuous publication of statistics or monitoringpurposes; such as real-time traffic analysis; timely disease outbreak discovery; and socialtrends observation. These statistics may be derived from sensitive user data and; hence;necessitate privacy preservation. A notable paradigm for offering strong privacy guaranteesin statistics publishing is ε-differential privacy. However; there is limited literature that adaptsthis concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an infinite stream of"events"(ie; data items generated by the users); and published periodically. These works aimat hiding a single event over the entire stream. We argue that; in most practical scenarios;sensitive information is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous timeinstances. Towards this end; we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy over infinite …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,55
Shortest path computation on air indexes,Georgios Kellaris; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract Shortest path computation is one of the most common queries in location-basedservices that involve transportation networks. Motivated by scalability challenges faced inthe mobile network industry; we propose adopting the wireless broadcast model for suchlocation-dependent applications. In this model the data are continuously transmitted on theair; while clients listen to the broadcast and process their queries locally. Although spatialproblems have been considered in this environment; there exists no study on shortest pathqueries in road networks. We develop the first framework to compute shortest paths on theair; and demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our techniques through experimentswith real road networks and actual device specifications.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,49
Trajectory compression under network constraints,Georgios Kellaris; Nikos Pelekis; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract The wide usage of location aware devices; such as GPS-enabled cellphones orPDAs; generates vast volumes of spatiotemporal streams modeling objects movements;raising management challenges; such as efficient storage and querying. Therefore;compression techniques are inevitable also in the field of moving object databases.Moreover; due to erroneous measurements from GPS devices; the problem of matching thelocation recordings with the underlying traffic network has recently gained the attention ofthe research community. So far; the proposed compression techniques are not designed fornetwork constrained moving objects; while map matching algorithms do not considercompression issues. In this paper; we propose solutions tackling the combined; mapmatched trajectory compression problem; the efficiency of which is demonstrated through …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,35
Map-matched trajectory compression,Georgios Kellaris; Nikos Pelekis; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract The wide usage of location aware devices; such as GPS-enabled cellphones orPDAs; generates vast volumes of spatiotemporal streams of location data raisingmanagement challenges; such as efficient storage and querying. Therefore; compressiontechniques are inevitable also in the field of moving object databases. Related work isrelatively limited and mainly driven by line simplification and data sequence compressiontechniques.

Generic attacks on secure outsourced databases,Georgios Kellaris; George Kollios; Kobbi Nissim; Adam O'Neill,Abstract Recently; various protocols have been proposed for securely outsourcing databasestorage to a third party server; ranging from systems with" full-fledged" security based onstrong cryptographic primitives such as fully homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM; tomore practical implementations based on searchable symmetric encryption or even ondeterministic and order-preserving encryption. On the flip side; various attacks haveemerged that show that for some of these protocols confidentiality of the data can becompromised; usually given certain auxiliary information. We take a step back and identify aneed for a formal understanding of the inherent efficiency/privacy trade-off in outsourceddatabase systems; independent of the details of the system. We propose abstract modelsthat capture secure outsourced storage systems in sufficient generality; and identify two …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,29
Accessing data while preserving privacy,Georgios Kellaris; George Kollios; Kobbi Nissim; Adam O'Neill,Abstract: As organizations struggle with vast amounts of data; outsourcing sensitive data tothird parties becomes a necessity. To protect the data; various cryptographic techniques areused in outsourced database systems to ensure data privacy; while allowing efficientquerying. Recent attacks on such systems demonstrate that outsourced database systemsmust trade-off efficiency and privacy. Towards designing systems that strike a good balancebetween these two aspects; we present a new model of differentially private outsourceddatabase systems; where differential privacy is preserved at the record level even against anuntrusted server that controls data and queries. Beginning with an atomic storage modelwhere the server can observe both the memory access pattern and communication volume;we provide upper-and lower-bounds on the efficiency of differentially private outsourced …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.01552,2017,3
Combining differential privacy and pir for efficient strong location privacy,Eric Fung; Georgios Kellaris; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Data privacy is a huge concern nowadays. In the context of location based services;a very important issue regards protecting the position of users issuing queries. Stronglocation privacy renders the user position indistinguishable from any other location. Thisnecessitates that every query; independently of its location; should retrieve the same amountof information; determined by the query with the maximum requirements. Consequently; theprocessing cost and the response time are prohibitively high for datasets of realistic sizes. Inthis paper; we propose a novel solution that offers both strong location privacy and efficiencyby adjusting the accuracy of the query results. Our framework seamlessly combines theconcepts of ϵ-differential privacy and private information retrieval (PIR); exploiting querystatistics to increase efficiency without sacrificing privacy. We experimentally show that …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,3
Revealing the Unseen: How to Expose Cloud Usage While Protecting User Privacy,Ata Turk; Mayank Varia; Georgios Kellaris,Abstract: Cloud users have little visibility into the performance characteristics and utilizationof the physical machines underpinning the virtualized cloud resources they use. Thisuncertainty forces users and researchers to reverse engineer the inner workings of cloudsystems in order to understand and optimize the conditions their applications operate. AtMassachusetts Open Cloud (MOC); as a public cloud operator; we'd like to expose theutilization of our physical infrastructure to stop this wasteful effort. Mindful that such exposurecan be used maliciously for gaining insight into other users workloads; in this position paperwe argue for the need for an approach that balances openness of the cloud overall withprivacy for each tenant inside of it. We believe that this approach can be instantiated via anovel combination of several security and privacy technologies. We discuss the potential …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.00714,2017,*
Engineering Methods for Differentially Private Histograms: Efficiency Beyond Utility,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract: Publishing histograms with $\epsilon $-differential privacy has been studiedextensively in the literature. Existing schemes aim at maximizing the utility of the publisheddata; while previous experimental evaluations analyze the privacy/utility trade-off. In thispaper we provide the first experimental evaluation of differentially private methods that goesbeyond utility; emphasizing also on another important aspect; namely efficiency. Towardsthis end; we first observe that all existing schemes are comprised of a small set of commonblocks. We then optimize and choose the best implementation for each block; determine thecombinations of blocks that capture the entire literature; and propose novel blockcombinations. We qualitatively assess the quality of the schemes based on the skyline ofefficiency and utility; ie; based on whether a method is dominated on both aspects or not …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.03440,2015,*
Practical differential privacy,Georgios Kellaris,In this thesis we focus on publishing statistics on a private database with ϵ-differentialprivacy. We target at three scenarios;(i) when the statistics are computed over a staticdatabase with high sensitivity;(ii) when we wish to publish 1-dimensional histograms; and(iii) when the statistics are published continuously over data that are updated by a stream.For the first scenario; we address one-time publishing of non-overlapping counts computedover highly sensitive data. These statistics are useful in a wide and important range ofapplications; including transactional; traffic and medical data analysis. Prior work on ϵ-differential privacy publishes such statistics with prohibitively low utility in several practicalscenarios. Towards this end; we present GS; a method that pre-processes the counts byelaborately g̲rouping and s̲moothing them via averaging. This step acts as a form of …,*,2015,*
