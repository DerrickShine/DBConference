Symmetry-breaking orbital anisotropy observed for detwinned Ba (Fe1-xCox) 2As2 above the spin density wave transition,Ming Yi; Donghui Lu; Jiun-Haw Chu; James G Analytis; Adam P Sorini; Alexander F Kemper; Brian Moritz; Sung-Kwan Mo; Rob G Moore; Makoto Hashimoto; Wei-Sheng Lee; Zahid Hussain; Thomas P Devereaux; Ian R Fisher; Zhi-Xun Shen,Abstract Nematicity; defined as broken rotational symmetry; has recently been observed incompeting phases proximate to the superconducting phase in the cuprate high-temperaturesuperconductors. Similarly; the new iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit atetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition (ie; a broken C 4 symmetry) that eitherprecedes or is coincident with a collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undopedparent compounds; and superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed viadoping. Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of compoundshas been reported by neutron scattering; scanning tunneling microscopy; and transportmeasurements. Here; we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study ofdetwinned single crystals of a representative family of electron-doped iron-arsenide …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2011,404
Spin fluctuations and superconductivity in a three-dimensional tight-binding model for BaFe 2 As 2,S Graser; AF Kemper; TA Maier; H-P Cheng; PJ Hirschfeld; DJ Scalapino,Abstract Despite the wealth of experimental data on the Fe-pnictide compounds of the K Fe2 As 2 type; K= Ba; Ca; or Sr; the main theoretical work based on multiorbital tight-bindingmodels has been restricted so far to the study of the related 1111 compounds. This can beascribed to the more three-dimensional electronic structure found by ab initio calculations forthe 122 materials; making this system less amenable to model development. In addition; themore complicated Brillouin zone (BZ) of the body-centered tetragonal symmetry does notallow a straightforward unfolding of the electronic band structure into an effective 1Fe/unitcell BZ. Here we present an effective five-orbital tight-binding fit of the full density functionaltheory band structure for BaFe 2 As 2 including the kz dispersions. We compare the five-orbital spin fluctuation model to one previously studied for LaOFeAs and calculate the …,Physical Review B,2010,223
Sensitivity of the superconducting state and magnetic susceptibility to key aspects of electronic structure in ferropnictides,AF Kemper; TA Maier; S Graser; HP Cheng; PJ Hirschfeld; DJ Scalapino,Abstract Experiments on the iron–pnictide superconductors appear to show some materialswhere the ground state is fully gapped; and others where low-energy excitations dominate;possibly indicative of gap nodes. Within the framework of a five-orbital spin fluctuation theoryfor these systems; we discuss how changes in the doping; the electronic structure orinteraction parameters can tune the system from a fully gapped to a nodal sign-changinggap with s-wave (A 1g) symmetry (s±). In particular; we focus on the role of the hole pocket atthe (π; π) point of the unfolded Brillouin zone; identified as crucial to the pairing by Kuroki etal (2009 Phys. Rev. B 79 224511); and show that its presence leads to additional nesting ofhole and electron pockets; which stabilizes the isotropic s±state. The pocket's contribution tothe pairing can be tuned by doping; surface effects and by changes in interaction …,New Journal of Physics,2010,134
Direct optical coupling to an unoccupied Dirac surface state in the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3,Jonathan A Sobota; S-L Yang; Alexander F Kemper; JJ Lee; Felix T Schmitt; Wei Li; Robert G Moore; James G Analytis; Ian R Fisher; Patrick S Kirchmann; Thomas P Devereaux; Z-X Shen,Abstract We characterize the occupied and unoccupied electronic structure of thetopological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 by one-photon and two-photon angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy and slab band structure calculations. We reveal a second; unoccupied Diracsurface state with similar electronic structure and physical origin to the well-knowntopological surface state. This state is energetically located 1.5 eV above the conductionband; which permits it to be directly excited by the output of a Ti: sapphire laser. Thisdiscovery demonstrates the feasibility of direct ultrafast optical coupling to a topologicallyprotected; spin-textured surface state.,Physical review letters,2013,74
Examining electron-boson coupling using time-resolved spectroscopy,Michael Sentef; Alexander F Kemper; Brian Moritz; James K Freericks; Zhi-Xun Shen; Thomas P Devereaux,Abstract Nonequilibrium pump-probe time-domain spectroscopies can become an importanttool to disentangle degrees of freedom whose coupling leads to broad structures in thefrequency domain. Here; using the time-resolved solution of a model photoexcited electron-phonon system; we show that the relaxational dynamics are directly governed by theequilibrium self-energy so that the phonon frequency sets a window for “slow” versus “fast”recovery. The overall temporal structure of this relaxation spectroscopy allows for a reliableand quantitative extraction of the electron-phonon coupling strength without requiring aneffective temperature model or making strong assumptions about the underlying bareelectronic band dispersion.,Physical Review X,2013,69
Effects of cobalt doping and three-dimensionality in BaFe 2 As 2,AF Kemper; C Cao; PJ Hirschfeld; H-P Cheng,Abstract We investigate the dual roles of a cobalt impurity in the Ba-122 ferropnictidesuperconductor in the state with coexisting collinear spin-density wave (SDW) order as adopant and as a scattering center; using first-principles electronic-structure methods. The Coatom is found to dope the FeAs plane where it is located with a single delocalized electronas expected; but also induces a strong perturbation of the SDW ground state of the system.This in turn induces a stripelike modulation of the density of states in nearby planes whichmay be observable in scanning tunnel microscope (STM) experiments. The defect is foundto have an intermediate strength nonmagnetic scattering potential with a range of roughly 1Å; and the Co gives rise to a smaller but longer range magnetic scattering potential. Theimpurity potential in both channels is highly anisotropic; reflecting the broken symmetry of …,Physical Review B,2009,66
Theory of Floquet band formation and local pseudospin textures in pump-probe photoemission of graphene,MA Sentef; M Claassen; AF Kemper; B Moritz; T Oka; JK Freericks; TP Devereaux,Abstract Ultrafast materials science promises optical control of physical properties of solids.Continuous-wave circularly polarized laser driving was predicted to induce a light-mattercoupled state with an energy gap and a quantum Hall effect; coined Floquet topologicalinsulator. Whereas the envisioned Floquet topological insulator requires high-frequencypumping to obtain well-separated Floquet bands; a follow-up question regards the creationof Floquet-like states in graphene with realistic low-frequency laser pulses. Here we predictthat short optical pulses attainable in experiments can lead to local spectral gaps and novelpseudospin textures in graphene. Pump-probe photoemission spectroscopy can track thesestates by measuring sizeable energy gaps and Floquet band formation on femtosecond timescales. Analysing band crossings and pseudospin textures near the Dirac points; we …,Nature communications,2015,64

Time-and momentum-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy; by virtue of measuring material properties at atomic andelectronic time scales out of equilibrium; can decouple entangled degrees of freedom byvisualizing their corresponding dynamics in the time domain. Here we combine time-resolved femotosecond optical and resonant X-ray diffraction measurements on chargeordered La 1.75 Sr 0.25 NiO 4 to reveal unforeseen photoinduced phase fluctuations of thecharge order parameter. Such fluctuations preserve long-range order without creatingtopological defects; distinct from thermal phase fluctuations near the critical temperature inequilibrium. Importantly; relaxation of the phase fluctuations is found to be an order of …,Nature communications,2012,61
Theoretical description of high-order harmonic generation in solids,AF Kemper; B Moritz; JK Freericks; TP Devereaux,Abstract We consider several aspects of high-order harmonic generation in solids: theeffects of elastic and inelastic scattering; varying pulse characteristics and inclusion ofmaterial-specific parameters through a realistic band structure. We reproduce manyobserved characteristics of high harmonic generation experiments in solids including theformation of only odd harmonics in inversion-symmetric materials; and the nonlinearformation of high harmonics with increasing field. We find that the harmonic spectra are fairlyrobust against elastic and inelastic scattering. Furthermore; we find that the pulsecharacteristics can play an important role in determining the harmonic spectra.,New Journal of Physics,2013,53
Anisotropic quasiparticle lifetimes in Fe-based superconductors,AF Kemper; MM Korshunov; TP Devereaux; JN Fry; HP Cheng; PJ Hirschfeld,Abstract We study the dynamical quasiparticle scattering by spin and charge fluctuations inFe-based pnictides within a five-orbital model with on-site interactions. The leadingcontribution to the scattering rate is calculated from the second-order diagrams with thepolarization operator calculated in the random-phase approximation. We find one-particlescattering rates which are highly anisotropic on each Fermi surface sheet due to themomentum dependence of the spin susceptibility and the multiorbital composition of eachFermi pocket. This fact; combined with the anisotropy of the effective mass; producesdisparity between electrons and holes in conductivity; the Hall coefficient; and the Ramaninitial slope; in qualitative agreement with experimental data.,Physical Review B,2011,43
Theory of light-enhanced phonon-mediated superconductivity,Michael A Sentef; AF Kemper; A Georges; C Kollath,Abstract We investigate the dynamics of a phonon-mediated superconductor driven out ofequilibrium. The electronic hopping amplitude is ramped down in time; resulting in anincreased electronic density of states. The dynamics of the coupled electron-phonon modelis investigated by solving Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the double-time Keldysh Green'sfunctions. The increase of the density of states near the Fermi level leads to anenhancement of superconductivity when the system thermalizes to the new state at the sametemperature. We provide a time-and momentum-resolved view on this thermalizationprocess and show that it involves fast processes associated with single-particle scatteringand much slower dynamics associated with the superconducting order parameter. Theimportance of electron-phonon coupling for the rapid enhancement and the efficient …,Physical Review B,2016,41
Distinguishing Bulk and Surface Electron-Phonon Coupling in the Topological Insulator Bi 2 Se 3 Using Time-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy,Jonathan A Sobota; S-L Yang; Dominik Leuenberger; Alexander F Kemper; James G Analytis; Ian R Fisher; Patrick S Kirchmann; Thomas P Devereaux; Z-X Shen,Abstract We report time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements onthe topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3. We observe oscillatory modulations of the electronicstructure of both the bulk and surface states at a frequency of 2.23 THz due to coherentexcitation of an A 1 g phonon mode. A distinct; additional frequency of 2.05 THz is observedin the surface state only. The lower phonon frequency at the surface is attributed to thetermination of the crystal and thus reduction of interlayer van der Waals forces; which serveas restorative forces for out-of-plane lattice distortions. Density functional theory calculationsquantitatively reproduce the magnitude of the surface phonon softening. These resultsrepresent the first band-resolved evidence of the A 1 g phonon mode coupling to the surfacestate in a topological insulator.,Physical review letters,2014,41
Density functional study of gold and iron clusters on perfect and defected graphene,Manoj K Srivastava; Yan Wang; AF Kemper; Hai-Ping Cheng,Abstract Metal clusters adsorbed on graphene can give rise to interesting physicalproperties. Using density-functional theory calculations; we investigate Au n and Fe n (n= 1–5) clusters adsorbed on perfect and defected graphene with a single vacancy. With theexception of Fe clusters on defected graphene; clusters are bonded to graphene through ananchor atom. Geometries of clusters on graphene are similar to their free-standing structuresexcept for the Fe 5 cluster on perfect graphene. Compared to Au; Fe clusters are morestrongly bonded to graphene. We find that it is important to include long-range van derWaals interactions for Au clusters adsorbed on perfect graphene. An Au 5 cluster becomesparallel to the graphene only when the van der Waals interactions are taken into account.Charge transfer between clusters and graphene shows strong size dependency; and the …,Physical Review B,2012,37
Creating stable Floquet–Weyl semimetals by laser-driving of 3D Dirac materials,Hannes Hübener; Michael A Sentef; Umberto De Giovannini; Alexander F Kemper; Angel Rubio,Abstract Tuning and stabilizing topological states; such as Weyl semimetals; Diracsemimetals or topological insulators; is emerging as one of the major topics in materialsscience. Periodic driving of many-body systems offers a platform to design Floquet states ofmatter with tunable electronic properties on ultrafast timescales. Here we show by firstprinciples calculations how femtosecond laser pulses with circularly polarized light can beused to switch between Weyl semimetal; Dirac semimetal and topological insulator states ina prototypical three-dimensional (3D) Dirac material; Na 3 Bi. Our findings are general andapply to any 3D Dirac semimetal. We discuss the concept of time-dependent bands andsteering of Floquet–Weyl points and demonstrate how light can enhance topologicalprotection against lattice perturbations.

Alternative route to charge density wave formation in multiband systems,Hans-Martin Eiter; Michela Lavagnini; Rudi Hackl; Elizabeth A Nowadnick; Alexander F Kemper; Thomas P Devereaux; Jiun-Haw Chu; James G Analytis; Ian R Fisher; Leonardo Degiorgi,Abstract Charge and spin density waves; periodic modulations of the electron; andmagnetization densities; respectively; are among the most abundant and nontrivial low-temperature ordered phases in condensed matter. The ordering direction is widely believedto result from the Fermi surface topology. However; several recent studies indicate that thiscommon view needs to be supplemented. Here; we show how an enhanced electron–latticeinteraction can contribute to or even determine the selection of the ordering vector in themodel charge density wave system ErTe 3. Our joint experimental and theoretical studyallows us to establish a relation between the selection rules of the electronic light scatteringspectra and the enhanced electron–phonon coupling in the vicinity of band degeneracypoints. This alternative proposal for charge density wave formation may be of general …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2013,35
Effect of dynamical spectral weight redistribution on effective interactions in time-resolved spectroscopy,AF Kemper; MA Sentef; B Moritz; JK Freericks; TP Devereaux,Abstract The redistribution of electrons in an ultrafast pump-probe experiment causessignificant changes to the spectral distribution of the retarded interaction between electronsand bosonic modes. We study the influence of these changes on pump-probephotoemission spectroscopy for a model electron-phonon coupled system using thenonequilibrium Keldysh formalism. We show that spectral rearrangement due to the drivingfield preserves an overall sum rule for the electronic self-energy; but modifies the effectiveelectron-phonon scattering as a function of energy. Experimentally; this pump-modifiedscattering can be tracked by analyzing the fluence or excitation energy dependence ofpopulation decay rates and transient changes in dispersion kinks.,Physical Review B,2014,34
Direct observation of Higgs mode oscillations in the pump-probe photoemission spectra of electron-phonon mediated superconductors,AF Kemper; MA Sentef; B Moritz; JK Freericks; TP Devereaux,Abstract Using the nonequilibrium Keldysh formalism; we solve the equations of motion forelectron-phonon superconductivity; including an ultrafast pump field. We present results fortime-dependent photoemission spectra out of equilibrium which probe the dynamics of thesuperconducting gap edge. The partial melting of the order by the pump field leads tooscillations at twice the melted gap frequency; a hallmark of the Higgs or amplitude mode.Thus the Higgs mode can be directly excited through the nonlinear effects of anelectromagnetic field and detected without requiring any additional symmetry breaking.,Physical Review B,2015,31

Manipulation of gap nodes by uniaxial strain in iron-based superconductors,Jian Kang; Alexander F Kemper; Rafael M Fernandes,Abstract In the iron pnictides and chalcogenides; multiple orbitals participate in thesuperconducting state; enabling different gap structures to be realized in distinct materials.Here we argue that the spectral weights of these orbitals can; in principle; be controlled by atetragonal symmetry-breaking uniaxial strain; due to the enhanced nematic susceptibility ofmany iron-based superconductors. By investigating multiorbital microscopic models in thepresence of orbital order; we show that not only T c can be enhanced; but pairs of accidentalgap nodes can be annihilated and created in the Fermi surface by an increasing externalstrain. We explain our results as a mixture of nearly degenerate superconducting statespromoted by strain; and show that the annihilation and creation of nodes can be detectedexperimentally via anisotropic penetration depth measurements. Our results provide a …,Physical Review Letters,2014,28
Dynamic competition between spin-density wave order and superconductivity in underdoped Ba1− xKxFe2As2,M Yi; Y Zhang; Z-K Liu; X Ding; J-H Chu; AF Kemper; N Plonka; B Moritz; M Hashimoto; S-K Mo; Z Hussain; TP Devereaux; IR Fisher; HH Wen; Z-X Shen; DH Lu,Abstract An intriguing aspect of unconventional superconductivity is that it always appears inthe vicinity of other competing phases; whose suppression brings the full emergence ofsuperconductivity. In the iron pnictides; these competing phases are marked by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition and a collinear spin-density wave (SDW) transition.There has been macroscopic evidence for competition between these phases andsuperconductivity as the magnitude of both the orthorhombicity and magnetic moment aresuppressed in the superconducting state. Here; using angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy on detwinned underdoped Ba 1− x K x Fe 2 As 2; we observe a coexistence ofboth the SDW gap and superconducting gap in the same electronic structure. Furthermore;our data reveal that following the onset of superconductivity; the SDW gap decreases in …,Nature communications,2014,28
Mapping of unoccupied states and relevant bosonic modes via the time-dependent momentum distribution,AF Kemper; M Sentef; B Moritz; CC Kao; ZX Shen; JK Freericks; TP Devereaux,Abstract The unoccupied states of complex materials are difficult to measure; yet they play akey role in determining their properties. We propose a technique that can measure theunoccupied states; called time-resolved Compton scattering; which measures the time-dependent momentum distribution (TDMD). Using a nonequilibrium Keldysh formalism; westudy the TDMD for electrons coupled to a lattice in a pump-probe setup. We find a directrelation between temporal oscillations in the TDMD and the dispersion of the underlyingunoccupied states; suggesting that both can be measured by time-resolved Comptonscattering. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility by applying the method to a model ofMgB 2 with realistic material parameters.,Physical Review B,2013,28
Electron-Mediated Relaxation Following Ultrafast Pumping of Strongly Correlated Materials: Model Evidence of a Correlation-Tuned Crossover between Thermal an...,Brian Moritz; AF Kemper; M Sentef; TP Devereaux; JK Freericks,Abstract We examine electron-electron mediated relaxation following ultrafast electric fieldpump excitation of the fermionic degrees of freedom in the Falicov-Kimball model forcorrelated electrons. The results reveal a dichotomy in the temporal evolution of the systemas one tunes through the Mott metal-to-insulator transition: in the metallic regime relaxationcan be characterized by evolution toward a steady state well described by Fermi-Diracstatistics with an increased effective temperature; however; in the insulating regime thisquasithermal paradigm breaks down with relaxation toward a nonthermal state with acomplicated electronic distribution as a function of momentum. We characterize the behaviorby studying changes in the energy; photoemission response; and electronic distribution asfunctions of time. This relaxation may be observable qualitatively on short enough time …,Physical review letters,2013,27
Theory of two-magnon Raman scattering in iron pnictides and chalcogenides,C-C Chen; CJ Jia; AF Kemper; RRP Singh; TP Devereaux,Abstract Although the parent iron-based pnictides and chalcogenides are itinerantantiferromagnets; the use of local moment picture to understand their magnetic properties isstill widespread. We study magnetic Raman scattering from a local moment perspective forvarious quantum spin models proposed for this new class of superconductors. Thesemodels vary greatly in the level of magnetic frustration and show a vastly different two-magnon Raman response. Light scattering by two-magnon excitations thus provides arobust and independent measure of the underlying spin interactions. In accord with otherrecent experiments; our results indicate that the amount of magnetic frustration in thesesystems may be small.,Physical review letters,2011,27
Insensitivity of d-wave pairing to disorder in the high-temperature cuprate superconductors,AF Kemper; DGSP Doluweera; TA Maier; M Jarrell; PJ Hirschfeld; HP Cheng,Abstract Using a dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo approximation; we investigate theeffect of local disorder on the stability of d-wave superconductivity including the effect ofelectronic correlations in both particle-particle and particle-hole channels. With increasingimpurity potential; we find an initial rise of the critical temperature due to an enhancement ofantiferromagnetic spin correlations; followed by a decrease of T c due to scattering fromimpurity-induced moments and ordinary pair breaking. We discuss the weak initialdependence of T c on impurity concentration found in comparison to experiments oncuprates.,Physical Review B,2009,22
Infrared study of the electronic structure of the metallic pyrochlore iridate Bi 2 Ir 2 O 7,YS Lee; SJ Moon; Scott C Riggs; MC Shapiro; IR Fisher; Bradford W Fulfer; Julia Y Chan; AF Kemper; DN Basov,Abstract We investigated the electronic properties of a single crystal of metallic pyrochloreiridate Bi 2 Ir 2 O 7 by means of infrared spectroscopy. Our optical conductivity data show thesplitting of t 2 g bands into J eff ones due to strong spin-orbit coupling. We observed asizable midinfrared absorption near 0.2 eV which can be attributed to the optical transitionwithin the J eff; 1/2 bands. More interestingly; we found an abrupt suppression of opticalconductivity in the very far-infrared region. Our results suggest that the electronic structure ofBi 2 Ir 2 O 7 is governed by the strong spin-orbit coupling and correlation effects; which are aprerequisite for theoretically proposed nontrivial topological phases in pyrochlore iridates.,Physical Review B,2013,18
Ultrafast electron dynamics in the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 studied by time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,Jonathan A Sobota; S-L Yang; Dominik Leuenberger; Alexander F Kemper; James G Analytis; Ian R Fisher; Patrick S Kirchmann; Thomas P Devereaux; Z-X Shen,Abstract We characterize the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 using time-and angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy. By employing two-photon photoemission; a complete pictureof the unoccupied electronic structure from the Fermi level up to the vacuum level isobtained. We demonstrate that the unoccupied states host a second Dirac surface statewhich can be resonantly excited by 1.5 eV photons. We then study the ultrafast relaxationprocesses following optical excitation. We find that they culminate in a persistent non-equilibrium population of the first Dirac surface state; which is maintained by a meta-stablepopulation of the bulk conduction band. Finally; we perform a temperature-dependent studyof the electron–phonon scattering processes in the conduction band; and find theunexpected result that their rates decrease with increasing sample temperature.

Using hot-electrons; we probe electrontransport perpendicular to the La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO)-Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (Nb: STO)interface and find the characteristic hot-electron attenuation length in LSMO to be 1.48±0.10unit cells (uc) at− 1.9 V; increasing to 2.02±0.16 uc at− 1.3 V at room temperature.Theoretical analysis of this energy dispersion reveals the dominance of electron-electronand polaron scattering.

Recently; it has become clear that a charge density wave (CDW) phaseexists within the pseudogap regime. This CDW coexists and competes withsuperconductivity (SC) below the transition temperature T c; suggesting that these twoorders are intimately related. Here we show that the condensation of the superfluid from thisunconventional precursor is reflected in deviations from the predictions of BSC theoryregarding the recombination rate of quasiparticles. We report a detailed investigation of thequasiparticle (QP) recombination lifetime; τ qp; as a function of temperature and magneticfield in underdoped HgBa 2 CuO 4+ δ (Hg-1201) and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x (YBCO) single …,Scientific reports,2016,14
Spin-polarized surface resonances accompanying topological surface state formation,Chris Jozwiak; Jonathan A Sobota; Kenneth Gotlieb; Alexander F Kemper; Costel R Rotundu; Robert J Birgeneau; Zahid Hussain; Dung-Hai Lee; Zhi-Xun Shen; Alessandra Lanzara,Abstract Topological insulators host spin-polarized surface states born out of the energeticinversion of bulk bands driven by the spin-orbit interaction. Here we discover previouslyunidentified consequences of band-inversion on the surface electronic structure of thetopological insulator Bi 2 Se 3. By performing simultaneous spin; time; and angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy; we map the spin-polarized unoccupied electronic structureand identify a surface resonance which is distinct from the topological surface state; yetshares a similar spin-orbital texture with opposite orientation. Its momentum dependenceand spin texture imply an intimate connection with the topological surface state. Calculationsshow these two distinct states can emerge from trivial Rashba-like states that changetopology through the spin-orbit-induced band inversion.

In particular; iron-basedsuperconductors exhibit a strong coupling among electronic nematic fluctuations; spins andthe lattice; serving as a playground for ultrafast manipulation. Here we use time-resolved X-ray scattering to measure the lattice dynamics of photoexcited BaFe 2 As 2. On opticalexcitation; no signature of an ultrafast change of the crystal symmetry is observed; but thelattice oscillates rapidly in time due to the coherent excitation of an A 1g mode thatmodulates the Fe–As–Fe bond angle. We directly quantify the coherent lattice dynamics andshow that even a small photoinduced lattice distortion can induce notable changes in theelectronic and magnetic properties. Our analysis implies that transient structural …,Nature Communications,2015,13
Nonequilibrium Green’s function study of Pd 4-cluster-functionalized carbon nanotubes as hydrogen sensors,Chao Cao; Alexander F Kemper; Luis Agapito; Jian-Wei Zhang; Yao He; Andrew Rinzler; Hai-Ping Cheng; X-G Zhang; Alexandre Reily Rocha; Stefano Sanvito,Abstract Pd-cluster-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been shownexperimentally to be effective hydrogen sensors. Semiconducting CNTs exhibit much highersensitivity than ensemble (mixed) ones. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function methodcombined with the density-functional theory; we simulate and contrast the (8; 0)semiconducting and the (5; 5) metallic CNT model systems. We find that the electronlocalization effect plays a crucial role in determining electron transport. Pd clusters andhydrogen adsorption cause opposite effects on electron localization in the CNT backbonefor the semiconducting CNT-based systems. Consequently Pd functionalization dramaticallyincreases the conductance; but then it is strongly suppressed by hydrogen absorption.

Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to studythese processes by resolving the complex single-particle self-energy and quantifying howquantum interactions modify bare electronic states. However; ambiguities in themeasurement of the real part of the self-energy and an intrinsic inability to disentanglevarious contributions to the imaginary part of the self-energy can leave the implications ofsuch measurements open to debate.

Tunneling spectroscopy for probing orbital anisotropy in iron pnictides,N Plonka; AF Kemper; S Graser; AP Kampf; TP Devereaux,Abstract Using realistic multiorbital tight-binding Hamiltonians and the T-matrix formalism;we explore the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity on the local density of states in Fe-basedcompounds. We show that scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has very specificanisotropic signatures that track the evolution of orbital splitting (OS) and antiferromagneticgaps. Both anisotropies exhibit two patterns that split in energy with decreasing temperature;but for OS these two patterns map onto each other under 90∘ rotation. STS experiments thatobserve these signatures should expose the underlying magnetic and orbital order as afunction of temperature across various phase transitions.,Physical Review B,2013,10
Pulsed high harmonic generation of light due to pumped Bloch oscillations in noninteracting metals,JK Freericks; AY Liu; AF Kemper; TP Devereaux,Abstract We derive a simple theory for high-order harmonic generation due to pumping anoninteracting metal with a large amplitude oscillating electric field. The model assumes thatthe radiated light field arises from the acceleration of electrons due to the time-varyingcurrent generated by the pump; and also assumes that the system has a constant density ofphotoexcited carriers; hence it ignores the dipole excitation between bands (which wouldcreate carriers in semiconductors). We examine the circumstances under which oddharmonic frequencies would be expected to dominate the spectrum of radiated light; and wealso apply the model to real materials like ZnO; for which high-order harmonic generationhas already been demonstrated in experiments.,Physica Scripta,2012,10
Curvature effect on the interaction between folded graphitic surface and silver clusters,AF Kemper; HP Cheng; N Kébaïli; S Benrezzak; M Schmidt; A Masson; C Bréchignac,Abstract Evidence of curvature effects on the interaction and binding of silver clusters onfolded graphitic surfaces has been shown from both experiment and theory. Densityfunctional theory (DFT) calculations within the local density and generalized gradientapproximations have been performed for the structural relaxation of both Ag and Ag 2 oncurved surfaces; showing a crossover from chemical to physical behavior. Using Lennard-Jones potential to model the interaction between a single cluster and the graphite surface;evidence is found for the curvature effect on the binding of silver nanoparticles to foldinggraphitic surfaces. The theoretical results are compared to scanning electron microscopyand atomic force microscopy images of samples obtained from preformed silver clusterdeposition on carboneous substrates exhibiting anisotropic pleat structures.,Physical Review B,2009,8
Surface vibrational modes of the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 observed by Raman spectroscopy,H-H Kung; M Salehi; I Boulares; AF Kemper; N Koirala; M Brahlek; P Lošťák; C Uher; R Merlin; X Wang; S-W Cheong; S Oh; G Blumberg,Abstract We present a polarization resolved Raman scattering study of surface vibrationmodes in the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 single crystal and thick films. Besides the fourRaman active bulk phonons; we observed four additional modes with much weaker intensityand slightly lower energy than the bulk counterparts. Using symmetry analysis; we assignedthese additional modes to out-of-plane surface phonons. Comparing with first-principlecalculations; we conclude that the appearance of these modes is due to c-axis latticedistortion and van der Waals gap expansion near the crystal surface. Two of the surfacemodes at 60 and 173 cm− 1 are associated with Raman active A 1 g bulk phonon modes;the other two at 136 and 158 cm− 1 are associated with infrared active bulk phonons with A2 u symmetry. The latter become Raman allowed due to reduction of crystalline symmetry …,Physical Review B,2017,7
Thickness-Dependent Coherent Phonon Frequency in Ultrathin FeSe/SrTiO3 Films,Shuolong Yang; Jonathan A Sobota; Dominik Leuenberger; Alexander F Kemper; James J Lee; Felix T Schmitt; Wei Li; Rob G Moore; Patrick S Kirchmann; Zhi-Xun Shen,Ultrathin FeSe films grown on SrTiO3 substrates are a recent milestone in atomic materialengineering due to their important role in understanding unconventional superconductivityin Fe-based materials. By using femtosecond time-and angle-resolved photoelectronspectroscopy; we study phonon frequencies in ultrathin FeSe/SrTiO3 films grown bymolecular beam epitaxy. After optical excitation; we observe periodic modulations of thephotoelectron spectrum as a function of pump–probe delay for 1-unit-cell; 3-unit-cell; and 60-unit-cell thick FeSe films. The frequencies of the coherent intensity oscillations increase from5.00±0.02 to 5.25±0.02 THz with increasing film thickness. By comparing with previousworks; we attribute this mode to the Se A1g phonon. The dominant mechanism for thephonon softening in 1-unit-cell thick FeSe films is a substrate-induced lattice strain.

Numerical integration for ab initio many-electron self energy calculations within the GW approximation,Fang Liu; Lin Lin; Derek Vigil-Fowler; Johannes Lischner; Alexander F Kemper; Sahar Sharifzadeh; H Felipe; Jack Deslippe; Chao Yang; Jeffrey B Neaton; Steven G Louie,Abstract We present a numerical integration scheme for evaluating the convolution of aGreen's function with a screened Coulomb potential on the real axis in the GWapproximation of the self energy. Our scheme takes the zero broadening limit in Green'sfunction first; replaces the numerator of the integrand with a piecewise polynomialapproximation; and performs principal value integration on subintervals analytically. We givethe error bound of our numerical integration scheme and show by numerical examples that itis more reliable and accurate than the standard quadrature rules such as the compositetrapezoidal rule. We also discuss the benefit of using different self energy expressions toperform the numerical convolution at different frequencies.,Journal of Computational Physics,2015,7
Ultrafast resonant soft x-ray diffraction dynamics of the charge density wave in TbTe 3,RG Moore; WS Lee; PS Kirchman; YD Chuang; AF Kemper; M Trigo; L Patthey; DH Lu; O Krupin; M Yi; DA Reis; D Doering; P Denes; WF Schlotter; JJ Turner; G Hays; P Hering; T Benson; J-H Chu; TP Devereaux; IR Fisher; Z Hussain; Z-X Shen,Abstract Understanding the emergence of collective behavior in correlated electron systemsremains at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics. Disentangling the degrees offreedom responsible for collective behavior can lead to insights into the microscopic originsof emergent properties and phase transitions. Utilizing an optical pump; resonant soft x-raydiffraction probe we are able to track; in real time; the dynamics of the charge density wave(CDW) in TbTe 3; a model system that violates traditional views of a Fermi surface nestedCDW. We observe coherent oscillations corresponding to the CDW amplitude mode at 2.4THz and a coherent optical phonon mode at∼ 1.7 THz. We show how such observationsreveal the anisotropic energy optimization between in-plane Te charge density modulationsand the three-dimensional lattice coupling.,Physical Review B,2016,6
Relationship between Population Dynamics and the Self-Energy in Driven Non-Equilibrium Systems,Alexander F Kemper; James K Freericks,Abstract: We compare the decay rates of excited populations directly calculated within aKeldysh formalism to the equation of motion of the population itself for a Hubbard-Holsteinmodel in two dimensions. While it is true that these two approaches must give the sameanswer; it is common to make a number of simplifying assumptions; within the differentialequation for the populations; that allows one to interpret the decay in terms of hot electronsinteracting with a phonon bath. Here; we show how care must be taken to ensure anaccurate treatment of the equation of motion for the populations due to the fact that there areidentities that require cancellations of terms that naively look like they contribute to the decayrates. In particular; the average time dependence of the Green's functions and self-energiesplays a pivotal role in determining these decay rates.,Entropy,2016,5
Classification of collective modes in a charge density wave by momentum-dependent modulation of the electronic band structure,D Leuenberger; JA Sobota; S-L Yang; AF Kemper; P Giraldo-Gallo; RG Moore; IR Fisher; PS Kirchmann; TP Devereaux; Z-X Shen,Abstract We present time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES)measurements on the charge density wave system CeTe 3. Optical excitation transientlypopulates the unoccupied band structure and reveals a gap size of 2 Δ= 0.59 eV. Theoccupied Te-5 p band dispersion is coherently modified by three modes at Ω 1= 2.2; Ω 2=2.7; and Ω 3= 3 THz. All three modes lead to small rigid energy shifts whereas Δ is onlyaffected by Ω 1 and Ω 2. Their spatial polarization is analyzed by fits of a transient modeldispersion and density-functional theory frozen phonon calculations. We conclude thatmodes Ω 1 and Ω 2 result from in-plane ionic lattice motions; which modulate the chargeorder and that Ω 3 originates from a generic out-of-plane A 1 g phonon. We therebydemonstrate how the rich information from trARPES allows identification of collective …,Physical Review B,2015,5
Time-dependent charge-order and spin-order recovery in striped systems,YF Kung; W-S Lee; C-C Chen; AF Kemper; AP Sorini; B Moritz; TP Devereaux,Abstract Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory; we study the role of amplitude andphase fluctuations in the recovery of charge-stripe and spin-stripe phases in response to apump pulse that melts the orders. For parameters relevant to the case where charge orderprecedes spin order thermodynamically; amplitude recovery governs the initial time scales;while phase recovery controls behavior at longer times. In addition to these intrinsic effects;there is a longer spin reorientation time scale related to the scattering geometry thatdominates the recovery of the spin phase. Coupling between the charge and spin orderslocks the amplitude and similarly the phase recovery; reducing the number of distinct timescales. Our results well reproduce the major experimental features of pump-probe x-raydiffraction measurements on the striped nickelate La 1.75 Sr 0.25 NiO 4. They highlight …,Physical Review B,2013,5
Scattering bottleneck for spin dynamics in metallic helical antiferromagnetic dysprosium,MC Langner; S Roy; AF Kemper; Y-D Chuang; SK Mishra; RB Versteeg; Y Zhu; MP Hertlein; TE Glover; K Dumesnil; RW Schoenlein,Abstract Ultrafast studies of magnetization dynamics have revealed fundamental processesthat govern spin dynamics; and the emergence of time-resolved x-ray techniques hasextended these studies to long-range spin structures that result from interactions withcompeting symmetries. By combining time-resolved resonant x-ray scattering and ultrafastmagneto-optical Kerr studies; we show that the dynamics of the core spins in the helicalmagnetic structure occur on much longer time scales than the excitation of conductionelectrons in the lanthanide metal Dy. The observed spin behavior differs markedly from thatobserved in the ferromagnetic phase of other lanthanide metals or transition metals and isstrongly dependent on temperature and excitation fluence. This unique behavior results fromcoupling of the real-space helical spin structure to the shape of the conduction electron …,Physical Review B,2015,4
Amplitude mode oscillations in pump-probe photoemission spectra from a d-wave superconductor,B Nosarzewski; B Moritz; JK Freericks; AF Kemper; TP Devereaux,Abstract Recent developments in the techniques of ultrafast pump-probe photoemissionhave made possible the search for collective modes in strongly correlated systems out ofequilibrium. Including inelastic scattering processes and a retarded interaction; we simulatetime-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to study the amplitudemode of a d-wave superconductor; a collective mode excited through the nonlinear light-matter coupling to the pump pulse. We find that the amplitude mode oscillations of the d-wave order parameter occur in phase at a single frequency that is twice the quasi-steady-state maximum gap size after pumping. We comment on the necessary conditions fordetecting the amplitude mode in trARPES experiments.,Physical Review B,2017,3
Time-resolved Boson Emission in the Excitation Spectrum of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ δ,JD Rameau; S Freutel; Michael A Sentef; AF Kemper; JK Freericks; I Avigo; M Ligges; L Rettig; Y Yoshida; H Eisaki; J Schneeloch; RD Zhong; ZJ Xu; GD Gu; PD Johnson; U Bovensiepen,Zusammenfassung Using femtosecond time-and angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy we analyze the complex unoccupied electronic structure of optimally doped Bi2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ δ after optical excitation. Electronic relaxation is characterized by a 250fs relaxation time below and< 20 fs above a single boson energy of~ 75 meV above theFermi energy EF which represents the unoccupied counterpart of the kink observed belowEF and T c. With increasing optical excitation density this sharp energy-dependent step inthe relaxation time is found to vanish; in good agreement with self-energy and time-dependent Keldysh Green's function calculations; due to redistribution of electrons within therelaxation phase space. These findings have implications regarding the origin of the primarynodal kink in the electronic structure and for the mechanism behind high T c …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.07055,2015,3
Amplitude mode oscillations in pump-probe photoemission spectra of electron-phonon mediated superconductors,Alexander Kemper; Michael Sentef; Brian Moritz; James Freericks; Thomas Devereaux,Abstract The amplitude; or Higgs mode is deeply intertwined with the historical developmentof the BCS theory of superconductivity. Although the presence of the Higgs mode isfundamental to superconductivity; it remained elusive for many decades; and its presenceand observability is still under debate in many contexts. We present results for time-dependent photoemission spectra to directly probe the dynamics of the superconductinggap edge where the fingerprint of superconductivity is strongest. The pumping of asuperconductor is simulated by solving the two-time Gor'kov equations of motion for theMigdal-Eliashberg model; which is a minimal gauge-invariant model for superconductivitywith a pairing boson and dissipation. The Higgs mode can be directly detected without therequirement of any additional symmetry breaking and is clearly visible as oscillations of …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2015,3
Exact solution for high harmonic generation and the response to an ac driving field for a charge density wave insulator,Wen Shen; A.F. Kemper; T.P. Devereaux; J.K. Freericks,Abstract We develop and exactly solve a model for electrons driven by pulsed or continuousac fields. The theory includes both the photoexcitation process as well as the subsequentacceleration of the electrons. In the case of an ac response; we examine both thenonequilibrium density of states and the current. In the case of pulsed light for high harmonicgeneration; we find the radiated light assumes a nearly universal behavior; with only limiteddependence on the parameters of the system; except for the amplitude of the driving field;which determines the range of high harmonics generated and a tendency toward anarrowing of the peaks in a charge density wave versus a metal. This type of high harmonicgeneration can potentially be used for the creation of solid-state-based ultrafast lightsources.,Physical Review B,2014,3

Raman spectroscopy shows softening with pressure of the vibration modes in theAu III-I 4 square planar units in the tetragonal phase; indicating a similar pressure-inducedlattice distortion as found for the closely related compounds CsAuCl 3 and CsAuBr 3.Multiple features in the higher pressure spectra confirm that the high-pressure phase has alower symmetry than the ambient pressure tetragonal structure; consistent with anorthorhombic structure discovered recently by x-ray diffraction measurements. From IRspectroscopy; we observed rapid bandgap closure at a rate of 0.2 eV/GPa in the tetragonalphase of CsAuI 3; close to the tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition.

Photoemission signature of excitons,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander F Kemper,Abstract: Excitons-the particle-hole bound states-composed of localized electron-hole statesin semiconducting systems are crucial to explaining the optical spectrum. Spectroscopicmeasurements can contain signatures of these two particle bound states and can beparticularly useful in determining the characteristics of these excitons. We formulate anexpression for evaluating the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum arising from theionization of excitons given their steady-state distribution in a semiconductor. We show thatthe spectrum contains information about the direct/indirect band gap nature of thesemiconductor and is located below the conduction band minimum displaced by the bindingenergy. The dispersive features of the spectrum contains remnants of the valence band.

These electronic states are mostaffected by the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations and charge instabilities; and they hostthe maximum of the anisotropic superconducting gap and pseudogap. We use time-resolvedextreme-ultraviolet photoemission with proper photon energy (18 eV) and time resolution(50 fs) to disclose the ultrafast dynamics of the antinodal states in a prototypical HTSCcuprate.

Band resolved imaging of photocurrent in a topological insulator,Hadas Soifer; Alexandre Gauthier; Alexander F Kemper; Costel R Rotundu; Shuolong Yang; Hongyu Xiong; Donghui Lu; Makoto Hashimoto; Patrick S Kirchmann; Jonathan A Sobota; Zhi-Xun Shen,Abstract: We study the microscopic ingredients to photocurrent generation in the topologicalinsulator Bi $ _2 $ Se $ _3 $ using time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We imagethe unoccupied band structure as it evolves following an optical excitation and observe anasymmetric electron population in momentum space that is controlled by the lightpolarization. By analyzing the rise times of the population we identify which occupied andunoccupied electronic states are coupled by optical excitation. We conclude thatphotocurrents can only be excited via resonant optical transitions coupling to spin-orbitaltextured states.

General principles for the non-equilibrium relaxation of populations in quantum materials,AF Kemper; O Abdurazakov; JK Freericks,Abstract: We examine the problem of how excited populations of electrons relax after theyhave been excited by a pump. We include three of the most important relaxationprocesses:(i) impurity scattering;(ii) Coulomb scattering; and (iii) electron-phonon scattering.The relaxation of an excited population of electrons is one of the most fundamentalprocesses measured in pump/probe experiments; but it is often not interpreted correctly. Weshow how to resolve four common and incorrect misconceptions about non-equilibriumrelaxation that are pervasive in the field. The resolution of these misconceptions shows thatnon-equilibrium relaxation is more complex than previously thought; but it yields to recentlydeveloped theoretical methods in non-equilibrium theory. We focus much of the discussionon implications of these results for experiment.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.05725,2017,1

We describe the formal developments that allow one to solve the Migdal-Eliashbergtheory in nonequilibrium for an ultrashort laser pumping field; and explore the solutionswhich illustrate the relaxation as energy is transferred from electrons to phonons. We focuson exact results emanating from sum rules and approximate numerical results whichdescribe rules of thumb for relaxation processes. In addition; in the superconducting state;we describe how Anderson-Higgs oscillations can be excited due to the nonlinear couplingwith the electric field and describe mechanisms where pumping the system enhancessuperconductivity.,*,2017,1
The role of average time dependence on the relaxation of excited electron populations in nonequilibrium many‐body physics,AF Kemper; HR Krishnamurthy; JK Freericks,Abstract We examine the exact equation of motion for the relaxation of populations ofstrongly correlated electrons after a nonequilibrium excitation by a pulsed field; and provethat the populations do not change when the Green's functions have no average timedependence. We show how the average time dependence enters into the equation ofmotion to lowest order and describe what governs the relaxation process of the electronpopulations in the long-time limit. While this result may appear; on the surface; to berequired by any steady-state solution; the proof is nontrivial; and provides new critical insightinto how nonequilibrium populations relax; which goes beyond the assumption that theythermalize via a simple relaxation rate determined by the imaginary part of the self-energy;or that they can be described by a quasi-equilibrium condition with a Fermi-Dirac …,Fortschritte der Physik,2017,1
Relaxation of nonequilibrium populations after a pump: the breaking of Mathiessen's rule,JK Freericks; O Abdurazakov; AF Kemper,From the early days of many-body physics; it was realized that the self-energy governs therelaxation or lifetime of the retarded Green's function. So it seems reasonable to directlyextend those results into the nonequilibrium domain. But experiments and calculations of theresponse of quantum materials to a pump show that the relationship between the relaxationand the self-energy only holds in special cases. Experimentally; the decay time for apopulation to relax back to equilibrium and the linewidth measured in a linear-responseangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy differ by large amounts. Theoretically; asidefrom the weak-coupling regime where the relationship holds; one also finds deviations andadditionally one sees violations of Mathiessen's rule. In this work; we examine whetherlooking at an effective transport relaxation time helps to analyze the decay times of …,SPIE Defense+ Security,2017,1
Energy dissipation in the time domain governed by bosons in a correlated material,JD Rameau; S Freutel; MA Sentef; AF Kemper; JK Freericks; I Avigo; M Ligges; L Rettig; Y Yoshida; H Eisaki; J Schneeloch; RD Zhong; ZJ Xu; GD Gu; PD Johnson; U Bovensiepen,Abstract: In complex materials various interactions play important roles in determining thematerial properties. Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used tostudy these processes by resolving the complex single particle self energy $\Sigma (E) $and quantifying how quantum interactions modify bare electronic states. However;ambiguities in the measurement of the real part of the self energy and an intrinsic inability todisentangle various contributions to the imaginary part of the self energy often leave theimplications of such measurements open to debate. Here we employ a combined theoreticaland experimental treatment of femtosecond time-resolved ARPES (tr-ARPES) and showhow measuring the population dynamics using tr-ARPES can be used to separate electron-boson interactions from electron-electron interactions.

First-principles study of the phonon modes in bismuth sillenites,DJ Arenas; Carl Middleton; AF Kemper,Abstract Density functional theory calculations of the vibrational modes of Bi 12 SiO 20 arepresented; with a detailed assignment and geometry investigation of the vibrational modesin the sillenite structure. We show that the symmetry and geometry of the strong Ramanpeaks allow direct probing of the Bi-O (1) and Bi-O (2) bonds. The physical significance ofthe vibrational modes is considered to discuss experimental data on the trivalent sillenitesand show evidence of O (1) and/or O (2) vacancies in the Bi-O framework. The infraredmodes are also discussed to motivate future systematic studies of sillenites. The Borneffective charges of sillenites are studied and the results show the existence of large andanisotropic charges.

Nonthermal pathway to antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals in pyrochlore iridates,Gabriel Topp; Nicolas Tancogne-Dejean; Alexander Kemper; Angel Rubio; Michael Sentef,The 227 pyrochlore iridates were conjectured to exhibit an antiferromagnetically orderedWeyl semimetallic (AF-WSM) phase provided that one could tune the ordered magneticmoment. Although the equilibrium phase diagram is still under lively debate boththeoretically and experimentally; no convincing evidence has been presented for the AF-WSM; and it appears that all the known compounds are antiferromagnetic insulators (AFI).Here we propose an ultrafast nonthermal pathway to engineer a nonequilibrium AF-WSMphase with short laser pulses. Motivated by Floquet-Weyl semimetallic states in non-magnetic 3D Dirac materials [1]; we investigate the dynamics after an interaction quench in amean-field dynamics simulation starting from the AFI phase.

Non-equilibrium Electron Dynamics In Pump-Probe Spectroscopy: Role Of Excited Phonon Populations,Omadillo Abdurazakov; Avinash Rustagi; James Freericks; Alexander Kemper,The time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(tr-ARPES) has emerged as a powerfultool to study the single-particle as well as collective dynamics of elementary excitations. Thedynamics allow for the measurement of energy transfer between degrees of freedom such aselectrons and phonons. When significant energy is deposited by the pump; or when the phononsare resonantly excited; the effect of excited phonons on the electrons plays an importantrole.

In systems with large Coulomb interactions;such as the two-dimensional dichalcogenide materials (eg MoS 2); the possibility exists ofthe excited electrons binding with the holes in the valence band and forming excitons; andthese may be observed through tr-ARPES.

However; it is not clear whether these photocurrents stemfrom topological surface states or bulk bands. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopyis used to probe the structure and dynamics of photocurrents in unoccupied electronic statesof Bi 2 Se 3 . Here we demonstrate the use of a “time mapping” analysis to measure which initialstates below the Fermi level couple to which unoccupied states via optical excitations; in aband-resolved manner. We measure the time following optical excitation for unoccupied statesto reach maximum population as a function of energy and momentum; faster rise times indicatedirect excitation from initial occupied states. Time mapping analysis displays promise for improvingour understanding of optoelectronic effects including photocurrent generation.,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
Room Temperature Electron-Hole Liquid in quasi-2D monolayer MoS $ _2$,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander Kemper,Strong correlations between electrons and holes can drive the system to the electron-holeliquid (EHL) state typically at high carrier densities and low temperatures. We study theformation of such a correlated electron-hole liquid state in monolayer MoS $ _2 $; a quasi-2D system where interactions between charge carriers are governed by the Keldyshpotential. We calculate the free energy at finite temperatures using the\textit {linked clusterexpansion} method incorporating ring diagrams. The variation of thermodynamic conjugatevariables indicate a first-order phase transition with a critical temperature larger than roomtemperature. We construct the phase diagram in the temperature-density phase space byMaxwell construction of thermodynamically unstable region demarcating phase spaceregions corresponding to exciton/electron-hole gas; electron-hole liquid and the region of …,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
Identifying a forward scattering superconductor through pump-probe spectroscopy,Ankit Kumar; Steven Johnston; AF Kemper,Abstract: Electron-boson scattering that is peaked in the forward direction has beensuggested as an essential ingredient for enhanced superconductivity observed in FeSemonolayers. Here; we study the superconducting state of a system dominated by forwardscattering in the time-domain and contrast its behavior against the standard isotropic BCScase for both s-and d-wave symmetries. An analysis of the electron's dynamics in the pump-driven non-equilibrium state reveals that the superconducting order in the forward-focusedcase is robust and persistent against the pump-induced perturbations. The superconductingorder parameter also exhibits a non-uniform melting in momentum space. We show that thisbehavior is in sharp contrast to the isotropic interaction case and propose that time-resolvedapproaches are a potentially powerful tool to differentiate the nature of the dominant …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.10019,2017,*
Theoretical Phase Diagram for the Room-Temperature Electron–Hole Liquid in Photoexcited Quasi-Two-Dimensional Monolayer MoS2,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander F Kemper,Strong correlations between electrons and holes can drive the existence of an electron–holeliquid (EHL) state; typically at high carrier densities and low temperatures. The recentemergence of quasi-two-dimensional (2D) monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) provides ideal systems to explore the EHL state since ineffective screening of theout-of-plane field lines in these quasi-2D systems allows for stronger charge carriercorrelations in contrast to conventional 3D bulk semiconductors and enables the existenceof the EHL at high temperatures. Here we construct the phase diagram for the photoinducedfirst-order phase transition from a plasma of electron–hole pairs to a correlated EHL state insuspended monolayer MoS2. We show that the quasi-2D nature of monolayer TMDCs andthe ineffective screening of the out-of-plane field lines allow for this phase transition to …,Nano letters,2017,*
Ultrafast Electron And Lattice Dynamics,Omadillo Abdurazakov; Avinash Rustagi; James Freericks; Alexander Kemper,The electron-lattice interactions have been subject to intense study since the dawn ofcondensed matter physics. Recent advances in the pump-probe spectroscopy brought abouta fresh perspective into their fundamental role in the normal and emergent phases of matter.We study the ultrafast dynamics of the excited electron populations in a 2D band by a laserpump field when coupled to the optical phonons with the fixed and dynamically updatedproperties. The trARPES spectra of photoexcited electrons indicate that the inclusion ofphonon dynamics strongly influences the single particle as well as many-body properties.The spectra acquire a diffused and broad structure owing to the increased phononoccupation. We also observe that the kink; traditionally regarded as the strength of theelectron-phonon interaction; is strongly weakened. The population decay rates are found …,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2017,*
Non-equilibrium electron and lattice dynamics in Bi-2212,Tatiana Konstantinova; Jonathan Rameau; Alexander Reid; Lijun Wu; Genda Gu; Alexander Kemper; Hermann Durr; Uwe Bovensiepen; Peter Johnson; Xijie Wang; Yimei Zhu,Here I present a study of the non-equilibrium lattice dynamics in a cuprate system; Bi-2212;performed by combining time-and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and MeVultrafast electron diffraction. We have conducted the one-to-one comparison betweenelectron and lattice dynamics in this material with 100 fs temporal resolution and establisheda picture of the energy flow within these two subsystems from the 1.55 eV photon absorptiontill formation of the acoustic waves. At the sub-picosecond time scale the dynamics isdominated by the electron coupling to the hot phonon; which we have identified through thequantitative analysis of the diffraction pattern changes as the in-plane Cu-O bond-stretchingmode. Later dynamics is dominated by the anharmonic decay of the hot phonon to the lowerenergy modes; while the coupling strength of the electrons to these modes is low.

Ultrafast dynamics of vibrational symmetry breaking in a charge-ordered nickelate,Giacomo Coslovich; Alexander F Kemper; Sascha Behl; Bernhard Huber; Hans A Bechtel; Takao Sasagawa; Michael C Martin; Alessandra Lanzara; Robert A Kaindl,The ability to probe symmetry-breaking transitions on their natural time scales is one of thekey challenges in nonequilibrium physics. Stripe ordering represents an intriguing type ofbroken symmetry; where complex interactions result in atomic-scale lines of charge and spindensity. Although phonon anomalies and periodic distortions attest the importance ofelectron-phonon coupling in the formation of stripe phases; a direct time-domain view ofvibrational symmetry breaking is lacking. We report experiments that track the transient multi-terahertz response of the model stripe compound La 1.75 Sr 0.25 NiO 4; yielding novelinsight into its electronic and structural dynamics following an ultrafast optical quench. Wefind that although electronic carriers are immediately delocalized; the crystal symmetryremains initially frozen—as witnessed by time-delayed suppression of zone-folded Ni–O …,Science Advances,2017,*

Here we perform the first time-resolved extreme-ultra-violet (EUV)photoemission experiment on a prototypical HTSC cuprate to disclose the ultrafast dynamicsof the antinodal states. After photoinducing a non-thermal charge redistribution within the Cuand O orbitals; we observe the modification of the antinodal bandstructure via the formationof transient additional states at the Fermi level; which relax back on the $\sim $100 fstimescale. Our results suggest that the antinodal suppression of states in the normal phasestems from the correlation-driven freezing of the electrons moving along the Cu-O bonds;analogously to the Mott localization mechanism.

Non-equilibrium dynamics of forward scattering superconductors,Alexander Kemper,Abstract Recent experiments have observed a surprisingly high critical temperature in amonolayer of FeSe on SrTiO3 an substrate. Among the proposed origins of this effect isenhancement or determination of the superconducting phase by a phonon within the SrTiO3substrate; whose effect on the FeSe monolayer is to provide a source of forward scattering. Itremains an open question whether such a forward scattering superconductor is realized inthe FeSe/SrTiO3 system. Using a non-equilibrium Keldysh approach; we study the effect of apump laser field on superconducting phase of a model forward scattering superconductor.We compare the resulting temporal dynamics to those of a more typical BCS-like isotropicsuperconductor; where the phonon scattering is not as limited. We demonstrate how pump-probe experiments can be used to distinguish the two types of superconductors under …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2017,*
Electron Energy Dissipation in the Normal State of Optimally Doped BSCCO,Jonathan Rameau; Simon Freutel; AF Kemper; MA Sentef; JK Freericks; I Avigo; M Ligges; L Rettig; Y Yoshida; H Eisaki; J Schneeloch; RD Zhong; GD Gu; PD Johnson; U Bovensiepen,Abstract New time-resolved ARPES (trARPES) results for the normal state of optimallydoped Bi2212 will be discussed. These measurements reveal three intrinsic timescales forrelaxation of hot carriers: an electron-electron timescale tau ee and two electron-phonontimescales; tau short (E) and tau long (E). While tau ee (E); appears to be energy-and pumpfluence-independent; tau short (E) and tau long (E) are found to be energy-dependent; withtau short (E) also fluence dependent. Further; a distinct step in tau short (E) at E 75 meVabove the Fermi energy is fount to originate from coupling of hot electrons to an opticalphonon mode. The implications of these findings will be addressed.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2017,*
Spin-polarized surface resonances accompanying topological surface state formation,Kenneth Gotlieb; Chris Jozwiak; Jonathan Sobota; Alexander Kemper; Costel Rotundu; Robert Birgenau; Zahid Hussain; Dung-Hai Lee; Zhi-Xun Shen; Alessandra Lanzara,Abstract Strong spin-orbit coupling can drive a band inversion that makes a materialtopologically non-trivial. Using spin; time; and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy;we study the unoccupied bandstructure in a topological insulator and find a spin-polarizedsurface resonance near the topological surface state. This new state is a remnant of Rashbabands on the trivial side of the topological phase transition. From this; we learn how the intothe topological surface state emerges upon band inversion.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2017,*
Non-equilibrium exciton dynamics in model systems,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander Kemper,Abstract Ultrashort laser pulses are used to observe time resolved dynamics in condensedmatter systems. The typical time resolved measurements include reflection; transmissionand absorption using pump-probe spectroscopy where a pump pulse excites the system intoa non-equilibrium state and the subsequent probe pulse measures the dynamical relaxationof the system as a function of a delay time. We study the two-particle properties of a modelinteracting two-band Hamiltonian by solving the non-equilibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation forthe correlation function. This allows us to study the dynamics of electron-hole bound statesie excitons; in model systems where the time translational invariance is broken by the pumppulse.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2017,*
Quasiparticle Dynamics Out of Equilibrium,Omadillo Abdurazakov; Alexander F Kemper,The strengths and types of interactions electrons experience in a crystal determine thephysical properties of a solid. One of the ways of studying the nature of these interactions isto perturb the material out of equilibrium by a laser field; and then observe its relaxationtoward equilibrium. Driving the electrons away from equilibrium not only can modify theirinteraction with different degrees of freedom [1]; but also can induce different phases ofmatter [2] and even change material's topology [3]. Since all the dynamic processesassociated with relaxation occur in the timescales of subpico-and femtoseconds; the timeand angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) has emerged as the main toolfor accessing these in ultafast timescales. Naturally; this necessitates the theoreticalunderstanding of the underlying physics of ultrafast phenomena. We explore temporal …,MRS/ASM/AVS 2016,2016,*

Nonequilibrium sum rules for the Holstein model,JK Freericks; Khadijeh Najafi; AF Kemper; TP Devereaux,Abstract: We derive frequency moment sum rules for the retarded electronic Green's functionand self-energy of the Holstein model for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases. Wealso derive sum rules for the phonon propagator in equilibrium and nonequilibrium. Thesesum rules allow one to benchmark nonequilibrium calculations and help with interpreting thebehavior of electrons driven out of equilibrium by an applied electric field. We exactlyevaluate the sum rules when the system is in the atomic limit. We also discuss theapplication of these sum rules to pump/probe experiments like time-resolved angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1403.5604,2014,*
T-matrix Impurity Effects on Nematicity in Iron-Based Supeconductors,Nachum Plonka; Alexander Kemper; Thomas Devereaux,Abstract In iron-based superconductors; nematicity has been reported in transportmeasurements and a broad range of spectroscopies; including angle-resolvedphotoemission; neutron scattering; and scanning tunneling microscopy. These observedanisotropies of broken tetragonal symmetry have been attributed to pure spin physics orunequal occupation of the iron d-electron orbitals; referred to as orbital ordering. To addressthis issue; we use realistic multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians and T-matrix formalism toexplore the effects of non-magnetic impurities. In particular; we present a detailedexamination of the local density of states around impurities; and highlight the interplay ofmagnetic and orbital degrees of freedom.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2012,*
Charge density wave formation in ErTe 3,Hans-Martin Eiter; Michela Lavagnini; Rudi Hackl; EA Nowadnick; AF Kemper; Thomas P Devereaux; JH Chu; JG Analytis; Ian R Fisher; Leonardo Degiorgi,Rare-earth tritellurides are model systems to study low dimensional interacting electrongases. ErTe 3 undergoes two charge density wave (CDW) phase transitions at 265 K and155 K at ambient pressure. External pressure can suppress both CDW transitionscompletely. Using Raman scattering; it is possible to detect the signature of both CDWenergy gaps as well as the corresponding collective amplitude mode excitations. This allowsus to map out the high pressure phase diagram. We also provide calculations on the basis ofthe electronic band structure which allow us to understand the selection rules as well as thespectra in a semi-quantitatively fashion.,Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft,2012,*
Nature of pairing in the FeAs superconductors,Siegfried Graser; Thomas A Maier; Alexander F Kemper; Peter J Hirschfeld; Douglas J Scalapino,A comparison of the new high-T c superconductors of the iron pnictide and chalcogenidefamily to the cuprates reveals startling similarities between the two classes: both are layeredmaterials with mainly 2D character; a conductivity that is dominated by d-electrons; and anantiferromagnetic or spin-density wave phase in proximity to the superconducting state.However; the pronounced multiband character of the iron pnictides; that becomes manifestin several disconnected Fermi surface sheets; distinguishes them from the cuprates andrequires a multiorbital description of its electronic properties. This multiorbital character ofthe bands at the Fermi level together with the rich momentum structure of the Fermi surfaceallows for a wide variety of possible superconducting ground states.

We find that Co isan intermediate strength magnetic scatterer with long-range effects visible in the localdensity of states. The model developed using DFT is then used; within the spin-fluctuationpairing mechanism; to study the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in thesesystems and the anisotropy of the quasiparticle lifetime.
