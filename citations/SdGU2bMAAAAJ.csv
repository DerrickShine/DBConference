MonetDB/XQuery: a fast XQuery processor powered by a relational engine,Peter Boncz; Torsten Grust; Maurice Van Keulen; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational XQuery systems try to re-use mature relational data managementinfrastructures to create fast and scalable XML database technology. This paper describesthe main features; key contributions; and lessons learned while implementing such asystem. Its architecture consists of (i) a range-based encoding of XML documents intorelational tables;(ii) a compilation technique that translates XQuery into a basic relationalalgebra;(iii) a restricted (order) property-aware peephole relational query optimizationstrategy; and (iv) a mapping from XML update statements into relational updates. Thus; thissystem implements all essential XML database functionalities (rather than a single feature)such that we can learn from the full consequences of our architectural decisions. Whileimplementing this system; we had to extend the state-of-the-art with a number of new …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,360
Staircase join: Teach a relational DBMS to watch its (axis) steps,Torsten Grust; Maurice van Keulen; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational query processors derive much of their effectiveness from the awarenessof specific table properties like sort order; size; or absence of duplicate tuples. This textapplies (and adapts) this successful principle to database-supported XML and XPathprocessing: the relational system is made tree aware; ie; tree properties like subtree size;intersection of paths; inclusion or disjointness of subtrees are made explicit. We propose alocal change to the database kernel; the staircase join; which encapsulates the necessarytree knowledge needed to improve XPath performance. Staircase join operates on an XMLencoding which makes this knowledge available at the cost of simple integer operations(eg;+;≤). We finally report on quite promising experiments with a staircase join enhancedmain-memory database kernel.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,224
High performance thermoelectric Tl 9 BiTe 6 with an extremely low thermal conductivity,Bernd Wölfing; Christian Kloc; Jens Teubner; Ernst Bucher,Abstract Tl 9 BiTe 6 exhibits a thermoelectric figure of merit of ZT∼ 1.2 around 500 K; whichsignificantly exceeds the state-of-the-art materials in this temperature range. Theextraordinary thermoelectric performance is mainly due to the extremely low thermalconductivity of Tl 9 BiTe 6 [0.39 W/(m ̇ K) at 300 K]. In fact; the minimum lifetime of thephonons has to be taken into account to describe the thermal conductivity data.,Physical review letters,2001,211
Accelerating XPath evaluation in any RDBMS,Torsten Grust; Maurice Van Keulen; Jens Teubner,Abstract This article is a proposal for a database index structure; the XPath accelerator; thathas been specifically designed to support the evaluation of XPath path expressions. Assuch; the index is capable to support all XPath axes (including ancestor; following;preceding-sibling; descendant-or-self; etc.). This feature lets the index stand out amongrelated work on XML indexing structures which had a focus on the child and descendantaxes only. The index has been designed with a close eye on the XPath semantics as well asthe desire to engineer its internals so that it can be supported well by existing relationaldatabase query processing technology: the index (a) permits set-oriented (or; rather;sequence-oriented) path evaluation; and (b) can be implemented and queried using well-established relational index structures; notably B-trees and R-trees. We discuss the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,200
XQuery on SQL hosts,Torsten Grust; Sherif Sakr; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational database systems may be turned into efficient XML and XPathprocessors if the system is provided with a suitable relational tree encoding. This paperextends this relational XML processing stack and shows that an RDBMS can also serve as ahighly efficient XQuery runtime environment. Our approach is purely relational: XQueryexpressions are compiled into SQL code which operates on the tree encoding. The core ofthe compilation procedure trades XQuery's notions of variable scopes and nested iteration(FLWOR blocks) for equi-joins. The resulting relational XQuery processor closely adheres tothe language semantics; eg; it obeys node identity as well as document and sequenceorder; and can support XQuery's full axis feature. The system exhibits quite promisingperformance figures in experiments. Somewhat unexpectedly; we will also see that the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,170
Main-memory hash joins on multi-core CPUs: Tuning to the underlying hardware,Cagri Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,The architectural changes introduced with multi-core CPUs have triggered a redesign ofmain-memory join algorithms. In the last few years; two diverging views have appeared. Oneapproach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the architectural parameters (cachesizes; TLB; and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues that modern hardware isgood enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and; consequently; the carefultailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In this paper we demonstratethrough experimental analysis of different algorithms and architectures that hardware stillmatters. Join algorithms that are hardware conscious perform better than hardware-obliviousapproaches. The analysis and comparisons in the paper show that many of the claimsregarding the behavior of join algorithms that have appeared in literature are due to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,167

Multi-core; main-memory joins: Sort vs. hash revisited,Cagri Balkesen; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In this paper we experimentally study the performance of main-memory; parallel;multi-core join algorithms; focusing on sort-merge and (radix-) hash join. The relativeperformance of these two join approaches have been a topic of discussion for a long time.With the advent of modern multi-core architectures; it has been argued that sort-merge join isnow a better choice than radix-hash join. This claim is justified based on the width of SIMDinstructions (sort-merge outperforms radix-hash join once SIMD is sufficiently wide); andNUMA awareness (sort-merge is superior to hash join in NUMA architectures). We conductextensive experiments on the original and optimized versions of these algorithms. Theexperiments show that; contrary to these claims; radix-hash join is still clearly superior; andsort-merge approaches to performance of radix only when very large amounts of data are …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,139
Streams on wires: a query compiler for FPGAs,Rene Mueller; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Taking advantage of many-core; heterogeneous hardware for data processingtasks is a difficult problem. In this paper; we consider the use of FPGAs for data streamprocessing as coprocessors in many-core architectures. We present Glacier; a componentlibrary and compositional compiler that transforms continuous queries into logic circuits bycomposing library components on an operator-level basis. In the paper we considerselection; aggregation; grouping; as well as windowing operators; and discuss their designas modular elements. We also show how significant performance improvements can beachieved by inserting the FPGA into the system's data path (eg; between the networkinterface and the host CPU). Our experiments show that queries on the FPGA can processstreams at more than one million tuples per second and that they can do this directly from …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,121
How soccer players would do stream joins,Jens Teubner; Rene Mueller,Abstract In spite of the omnipresence of parallel (multi-core) systems; the predominantstrategy to evaluate window-based stream joins is still strictly sequential; mostly juststraightforward along the definition of the operation semantics. In this work we presenthandshake join; a way of describing and executing window-based stream joins that is highlyamenable to parallelized execution. Handshake join naturally leverages available hardwareparallelism; which we demonstrate with an implementation on a modern multi-core systemand on top of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); an emerging technology that hasshown distinctive advantages for high-throughput data processing.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,99

Complex event detection at wire speed with FPGAs,Louis Woods; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Complex event detection is an advanced form of data stream processing where thestream (s) are scrutinized to identify given event patterns. The challenge for many complexevent processing (CEP) systems is to be able to evaluate event patterns on high-volumedata streams while adhering to real-time constraints. To solve this problem; in this paper wepresent a hardware-based complex event detection system implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). By inserting the FPGA directly into the data pathbetween the network interface and the CPU; our solution can detect complex events atgigabit wire speed with constant and fully predictable latency; independently of networkload; packet size; or data distribution. This is a significant improvement over CPU-basedsystems and an architectural approach that opens up interesting opportunities for hybrid …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,84
Why off-the-shelf RDBMSs are better at XPath than you might expect,Torsten Grust; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract To compensate for the inherent impedance mismatch between the relational datamodel (tables of tuples) and XML (ordered; unranked trees); tree join algorithms havebecome the prevalent means to process XML data in relational databases; most notably theTwigStack [6]; structural join [1]; and staircase join [13] algorithms. However; the addition ofthese algorithms to existing systems depends on a significant invasion of the underlyingdatabase kernel; an option intolerable for most database vendors. Here; we demonstratethat we can achieve comparable XPath performance without touching the heart of thesystem. We carefully exploit existing database functionality and accelerate XPath navigationby purely relational means: partitioned B-trees bring access costs to secondary storage to aminimum; while aggregation functions avoid an expensive computation and removal of …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,67
Glacier: a query-to-hardware compiler,Rene Mueller; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a promising technology that can beused in database systems. In this demonstration we show Glacier; a library and a compilerthat can be employed to implement streaming queries as hardware circuits on FPGAs.Glacier consists of a library of compositional hardware modules that represent streamprocessing operators. Given a query execution plan; the compiler instantiates thecorresponding components and wires them up to a digital circuit. The goal of this demo is toshow the flexibility of the compositional approach.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,61
Pathfinder: XQuery---the relational way,Peter Boncz; Torsten Grust; Maurice van Keulen; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational query processors are probably the best understood (as well as the bestengineered) query engines available today. Although carefully tuned to process instances ofthe relational model (tables of tuples); these processors can also provide a foundation forthe evaluation of" alien"(non-relational) query languages: if a relational encoding of the aliendata model and its associated query language is given; the RDBMS may act like a special-purpose processor for the new language.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,57
Relational Algebra: Mother Tongue—XQuery: Fluent,Torsten Grust; Jens Teubner,This work may be seen as a further proof of the versatility of the relational database model.Here; we add XQuery to the catalog of languages which RDBMSs are able to" speak"fluently. Given suitable relational encodings of sequences and ordered; unranked trees-thetwo data structures that form the backbone of the XML and XQuery data models-we describea compiler that translates XQuery expressions into a simple and quite standard relationalalgebra which we expect to be efficiently implementable on top of any relational queryengine. The compilation procedure is fully compositional and emits algebraic code thatstrictly adheres to the XQuery language semantics: document and sequence order as wellas node identity are obeyed. We exercise special care in translating arbitrarily nestedXQuery FLWOR iteration constructs into equi-joins; an operation which RDBMSs can …,Twente Data Management Workshop on XML Databases and Information Retrieval,2004,47
FPGA: what's in it for a database?,Rene Mueller; Jens Teubner,Abstract While there seems to be a general agreement that next years' systems will includemany processing cores; it is often overlooked that these systems will also include anincreasing number of different cores (we already see dedicated units for graphics or networkprocessing). Orchestrating the diversity of processing functionality is going to be a majorchallenge in the upcoming years; be it to optimize for performance or for minimal energyconsumption. We expect field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs or" programmablehardware") to soon play the role of yet another processing unit; found in commoditycomputers. It is clear that the new resource is going to be too precious to be ignored bydatabase systems; but it is unclear how FPGAs could be integrated into a DBMS.

A SQL: 1999 code generator for the pathfinder XQuery compiler,Torsten Grust; Manuel Mayr; Jan Rittinger; Sherif Sakr; Jens Teubner,Abstract The Pathfinder XQuery compiler has been enhanced by a new code generator thatcan target any SQL: 1999-compliant relational database system (RDBMS). This codegenerator marks an important next step towards truly relational XQuery processing; a branchof database technology that aims to turn RDBMSs into highly efficient XML and XQueryprocessors without the need to invade the relational database kernel. Pathfinder; aretargetable front-end compiler; translates input XQuery expressions into DAG-shapedrelational algebra plans. The code generator then turns these plans into sequences of eitherSQL: 1999 statements or view definitions which jointly implement the (sometimes intricate)XQuery semantics. In a sense; this demonstration thus lets relational algebra and SQL swaptheir traditional roles in database query processing. The result is a code generator that (1) …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,37

Dependable cardinality forecasts for XQuery,Jens Teubner; Torsten Grust; Sebastian Maneth; Sherif Sakr,Abstract Though inevitable for effective cost-based query rewriting; the derivation ofmeaningful cardinality estimates has remained a notoriously hard problem in the context ofXQuery. By basing the estimation on a relational representation of the XQuery syntax; weshow how existing cardinality estimation techniques for XPath and proven relationalestimation machinery can play together to yield dependable forecasts for arbitrary XQuery(sub) expressions. Our approach benefits from a light-weight form of data flow analysis.Abstract domain identifiers guide our query analyzer through the estimation process andallow for informed decisions even in case of deeply nested XQuery expressions. A variant ofprojection paths [15] provides a versatile interface into which existing techniques for XPathcardinality estimation can be plugged in seamlessly.

Spinning relations: high-speed networks for distributed join processing,Philip W Frey; Romulo Goncalves; Martin Kersten; Jens Teubner,Abstract By leveraging modern networking hardware (RDMA-enabled network cards); wecan shift priorities in distributed database processing significantly. Complex andsophisticated mechanisms to avoid network traffic can be replaced by a scheme that takesadvantage of the bandwidth and low latency offered by such interconnects. We illustrate thisphenomenon with cyclo-join; an efficient join algorithm based on continuously pumping datathrough a ring-structured network. Our approach is capable of exploiting the resources of allCPUs and distributed main-memory available in the network for processing queries ofarbitrary shape and datasets of arbitrary size.,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2009,33
Frequent item computation on a chip,Jens Teubner; Rene Muller; Gustavo Alonso,Computing frequent items is an important problem by itself and as a subroutine in severaldata mining algorithms. In this paper; we explore how to accelerate the computation offrequent items using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a threefold goal: increaseperformance over existing solutions; reduce energy consumption over CPU-based systems;and explore the design space in detail as the constraints on FPGAs are very different fromthose of traditional software-based systems. We discuss three design alternatives; each oneof them exploiting different FPGA features and each one providing different performance/scalability trade-offs. An important result of the paper is to demonstrate how the inherentmassive parallelism of FPGAs can improve performance of existing algorithms but only aftera fundamental redesign of the algorithms. Our experimental results show that; eg; the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,31
eXrQuy: Order indifference in XQuery,Torsten Grust; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,There are more spots than immediately obvious in XQuery expressions where order isimmaterial for evaluation-this affects most notably; but not exclusively; expressions in thescope of unordered {} and the argument of fn: unordered (). Clearly; performance gains arelurking behind such expression contexts but the prevalent impact of order on the XQuerysemantics reaches deep into any compliant XQuery processor; making it non-trivial to setthis potential free. Here; we describe how the relational XQuery compiler Pathfinderuniformly exploits such order indifference in a purely algebraic fashion: Pathfinder-emittedplans faithfully implement the required XQuery order semantics but (locally) ignore orderwherever this is admitted.,Data Engineering; 2007.

Pathfinder: XQuery Compilation Techniques for Relational Database Targets,Jens Thilo Teubner,Even after at least a decade of work on XML and semi-structured information; such data is stillpredominantly processed in main-memory; which obviously leads to significant constraints forgrowing XML document sizes. On the other hand; mature database technologies are readilyavailable to handle vast amounts of data easily. The most efficient ones; relational databasemanagement systems (RDBMSs); however; are largely locked-in to the processing of veryregular; table-shaped data only. In this thesis; we will unleash the power of relational databasetechnology to the domain of semi-structured data; the world of XML. We will present a purelyrelational XQuery processor that handles huge amounts of XML data in an efficient and scalablemanner. Our setup is based on a relational tree encoding.

Main-memory hash joins on modern processor architectures,Çağrı Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,Existing main-memory hash join algorithms for multi-core can be classified into two camps.Hardware-oblivious hash join variants do not depend on hardware-specific parameters.Rather; they consider qualitative characteristics of modern hardware and are expected toachieve good performance on any technologically similar platform. The assumption behindthese algorithms is that hardware is now good enough at hiding its own limitations-throughautomatic hardware prefetching; out-of-order execution; or simultaneous multi-threading(SMT)-to make hardware-oblivious algorithms competitive without the overhead of carefullytuning to the underlying hardware. Hardware-conscious implementations; such as (parallel)radix join; aim to maximally exploit a given architecture by tuning the algorithm parameters(eg; hash table sizes) to the particular features of the architecture. The assumption here is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,26
Low-latency handshake join,Pratanu Roy; Jens Teubner; Rainer Gemulla,Abstract This work revisits the processing of stream joins on modern hardware architectures.Our work is based on the recently proposed handshake join algorithm; which is amechanism to parallelize the processing of stream joins in a NUMA-aware and hardware-friendly manner. Handshake join achieves high throughput and scalability; but it suffers froma high latency penalty and a non-deterministic ordering of the tuples in the physical resultstream. In this paper; we first characterize the latency behavior of the handshake join andthen propose a new low-latency handshake join algorithm; which substantially reduceslatency without sacrificing throughput or scalability. We also present a technique to generatepunctuated result streams with very little overhead; such punctuations allow the generationof correctly ordered physical output streams with negligible effect on overall throughput …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,25
Data processing on FPGAs,Jens Teubner; Louis Woods,Abstract Download Free Sample Roughly a decade ago; power consumption and heatdissipation concerns forced the semiconductor industry to radically change its course;shifting from sequential to parallel computing. Unfortunately; improving performance ofapplications has now become much more difficult than in the good old days of frequencyscaling. This is also affecting databases and data processing applications in general; andhas led to the popularity of so-called data appliances—specialized data processing engines;where software and hardware are sold together in a closed box. Field-programmable gatearrays (FPGAs) increasingly play an important role in such systems. FPGAs are attractivebecause the performance gains of specialized hardware can be significant; while powerconsumption is much less than that of commodity processors. On the other hand; FPGAs …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2013,25
Skeleton automata for FPGAs: reconfiguring without reconstructing,Jens Teubner; Louis Woods; Chongling Nie,Abstract While the performance opportunities of field-programmable gate arrays field(FPGAs) field for high-volume query processing are well-known; system makers still have tocompromise between desired query expressiveness and high compilation effort. The cost ofthe latter is the primary limitation in building efficient FPGA/CPU hybrids. In this work wereport on an FPGA-based stream processing engine that does not have this limitation. Weprovide a hardware implementation of XML projection [14] that can be reconfigured in lessthan a micro-second; yet supports a rich and expressive dialect of XPath. By performing XMLprojection in the network; we can fully leverage its filtering effect and improve XQueryperformance by several factors.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,25
A spinning join that does not get dizzy,Philip W Frey; Romulo Goncalves; Martin Kersten; Jens Teubner,As network infrastructures with 10 Gb/s bandwidth and beyond have become pervasive andas cost advantages of large commodity-machine clusters continue to increase; research andindustry strive to exploit the available processing performance for large-scale databaseprocessing tasks. In this work we look at the use of high-speed networks for distributed joinprocessing. We propose Data Roundabout as alight weight transport layer that uses RemoteDirect Memory Access (RDMA) to gain access to the throughput opportunities in modernnetworks. The essence of Data Roundabout is a ring shaped network in which each hoststores one portion of a large database instance. We leverage the available bandwidth to(continuously) pump data through the high-speed network.

Though a lot of theoretical work has beendone in this area and various solutions have been proposed; no complete systems havebeen made available so far to give the practical evidence that this is a viable approach. Inthis paper; we describe the ourely relational XQuery processor Pathfinder that has been builton top of the extensible RDBMS MonetDB. Performance results indicate that the system iscapable of evaluating XQuery queries efficiently; even if the input XML documents becomehuge.

Parallel computation of skyline queries,Louis Woods; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner,Due to stagnant clock speeds and high power consumption of commodity microprocessors;database vendors have started to explore massively parallel co-processors such as FPGAsto further increase performance. A typical approach is to push simple but compute-intensiveoperations (eg; prefiltering;(de) compression) to FPGAs for acceleration. In this paper; weshow how a significantly more complex operation-the computation of the skyline-can beholistically implemented on an FPGA. A skyline query computes the pareto optimal set ofmulti-dimensional data points. These queries have been studied in software extensivelyover the last decade but this paper is the first to examine skyline computation in hardware.We propose a methodology that interleaves data storage and computation; allowing multipleoperations to be executed on the same working set in parallel; while accounting for all …,Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM); 2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on,2013,24
Efficient frequent item counting in multi-core hardware,Pratanu Roy; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract The increasing number of cores and the rich instruction sets of modern hardwareare opening up new opportunities for optimizing many traditional data mining tasks. In thispaper we demonstrate how to speed up the performance of the computation of frequentitems by almost one order of magnitude over the best published results by matching thealgorithm to the underlying hardware architecture. We start with the observation that frequentitem counting; like other data mining tasks; assumes certain amount of skew in the data. Weexploit this skew to design a new algorithm that uses a pre-filtering stage that can beimplemented in a highly efficient manner through SIMD instructions. Using pipelining; wethen combine this pre-filtering stage with a conventional frequent item algorithm (Space-Saving) that will process the remainder of the data.

Robust query processing in co-processor-accelerated databases,Sebastian Breß; Henning Funke; Jens Teubner,Abstract Technology limitations are making the use of heterogeneous computing devicesmuch more than an academic curiosity. In fact; the use of such devices is widelyacknowledged to be the only promising way to achieve application-speedups that usersurgently need and expect. However; building a robust and efficient query engine forheterogeneous co-processor environments is still a significant challenge. In this paper; weidentify two effects that limit performance in case co-processor resources become scarce.Cache thrashing occurs when the working set of queries does not fit into the co-processor'sdata cache; resulting in performance degradations up to a factor of 24. Heap contentionoccurs when multiple operators run in parallel on a co-processor and when theiraccumulated memory footprint exceeds the main memory capacity of the co-processor …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,19

An Injection with Tree Awareness: Adding Staircase Join to PostgreSQL,Sabine Mayer; Torsten Grust; Maurice van Keulen; Jens Teubner,The syntactic wellformedness constraints of XML (opening and closing tags nest properly)imply that XML processors face the challenge to efficiently handle data that takes the shapeof ordered; unranked trees. Although RDBMSs have originally been designed to managetable-shaped data; we propose their use as XML and XPath processors. In our setup; thedatabase system employs a relational XML document encoding; the XPath accelerator [1];which maps information about the XML node hierarchy to a table; thus making it possible toevaluate XPath expressions on SQL hosts. Conventional RDBMSs; nevertheless; remainignorant of many interesting properties of the encoded tree data; and were thus found tomake no or poor use of these properties. This is why we devised a new join algorithm;staircase join [2]; which incorporates the tree-specific knowledge required for an efficient …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,18
FPGAs: a new point in the database design space,Rene Mueller; Jens Teubner,Abstract In line with the insight that" one size" of databases will not fit all application needs[19] the database community is currently exploring various alternatives to commodity; CPU-based system designs. One particular candidate in this trend are field-programmable gatearrays (FPGAs); programmable chips that allow tailor-made hardware designs optimized forspecific systems; applications; or even user queries. With a focus on database use; thistutorial introduces into FPGA technology; demonstrates its potential; but also pinpoints somechallenges that need to be addressed before FPGA-accelerated database systems can gomainstream.

Pathfinder: XQuery off the relational shelf,Torsten Grust; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract The Pathfinder project makes inventive use of relational database technology—originally developed to process data of strictly tabular shape—to construct efficient database-supported XML and XQuery processors. Pathfinder targets database engines that implementa set-oriented mode of query execution: many off-the-shelf traditional database systemsmake for suitable XQuery runtime environments; but a number of off-beat storage back-endsfit that bill as well. While Pathfinder has been developed with a close eye on the XQuerysemantics; some of the techniques that we will review here will be generally useful toevaluate XQuery-style iterative languages on database back-ends.,IEEE Data Eng.

An inflationary fixed point operator in XQuery,Loredana Afanasiev; Torsten Grust; Maarten Marx; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,We introduce a controlled form of recursion in XQuery; an inflationary fixed point operator;familiar from the context of relational databases. This operator imposes restrictions on theexpressible types of recursion; but we show that it is sufficiently versatile to capture a widerange of interesting use cases; including Regular XPath and its core transitive closureoperator. While the optimization of general user-defined recursive functions in XQueryappears elusive; we describe how inflationary fixed points can be efficiently evaluated;provided that the recursive XQuery expressions are distributive. We test distributivitysyntactically and algebraically; and provide experimental evidence that XQuery processorscan benefit substantially from this mode of evaluation.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Visualizing vowel harmony,Thomas Mayer; Christian Rohrdantz; Miriam Butt; Frans Plank; Daniel Keim,Abstract This paper deals with vowel harmony from a cross-linguistic perspective; with theaim of visualizing the distribution of vowels in corpora so that languages with vowel harmonycan be distinguished from those lacking it. For this purpose vowel successions within wordsare statistically analyzed and visualized in a quadratic matrix whose rows and columns areordered according to their distribution in the text; with more similar vowels occurring closertogether. The method has been tested on the basis of Bible corpora in a variety of languagesincluding well-known harmonic languages such as Turkish; Hungarian and Finnish as wellas non-harmonic languages.,Linguistic issues in language technology,2010,13
Real-time pattern matching with FPGAs,Louis Woods; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,We demonstrate a hardware implementation of a complex event processor; built on top offield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Compared to CPU-based commodity systems; oursolution shows distinctive advantages for stream monitoring tasks; eg; wire-speedprocessing and predictable performance. The demonstration is based on a query-to-hardware compiler for complex event patterns that we presented at VLDB 2010 [1]. Byexample of a click stream monitoring application; we illustrate the inner workings of ourcompiler and indicate how FPGAs can act as efficient and reliable processors for eventstreams.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,12
Recursion in XQuery: put your distributivity safety belt on,Loredana Afanasiev; Torsten Grust; Maarten Marx; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract We introduce a controlled form of recursion in XQuery; an inflationary fixed pointoperator; familiar from the context of relational databases. This operator imposes restrictionson the expressible types of recursion; but it is sufficiently versatile to capture a wide range ofinteresting use cases; including Regular XPath and its core transitive closure operator.While the optimization of general user-defined recursive functions in XQuery appearselusive; we describe how inflationary fixed points can be efficiently evaluated; provided thatthe recursive XQuery expressions are distributive. We test distributivity syntactically andalgebraically; and provide experimental evidence that XQuery processors can benefitsubstantially from this mode of evaluation.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,11
MonetDB/XQuery—consistent and efficient updates on the pre/Post plane,Peter Boncz; Jan Flokstra; Torsten Grust; Maurice van Keulen; Stefan Manegold; Sjoerd Mullender; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational XQuery processors aim at leveraging mature relational DBMS queryprocessing technology to provide scalability and efficiency. To achieve this goal; variousstorage schemes have been proposed to encode the tree structure of XML documents in flatrelational tables. Basically; two classes can be identified:(1) encodings using fixed-lengthsurrogates; like the preorder ranks in the pre/post encoding [5] or the equivalentpre/size/level encoding [8]; and (2) encodings using variable-length surrogates; like; eg;ORDPATH [9] or P-PBiTree [12]. Recent research [1] showed a clear advantage of theformer for efficient evaluation of XPath location steps; exploiting techniques like cheap nodeorder tests; positional lookup; and node skipping in staircase join [7]. However; onceupdates are involved; variable-length surrogates are often considered the better choice …,Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2006,2006,10
Group Recommendation with Temporal Affinities.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Behrooz Omidvar Tehrani; Senjuti Basu Roy; Nafiseh Shabib; G Alonso; F Geerts; L Popa; P Barceló; J Teubner,ABSTRACT We examine the problem of recommending items to ad-hoc user groups. Grouprecommendation in collaborative rating datasets has received increased attention recentlyand has raised novel challenges. Different consensus functions that aggregate the ratings ofgroup members with varying semantics ranging from least misery to pairwise disagreement;have been studied. In this paper; we explore a new dimension when computing grouprecommendations; that is; affinity between group members and its evolution over time. Weextend existing group recommendation semantics to include temporal affinity inrecommendations and design GRECA; an efficient algorithm that produces temporal affinity-aware recommendations for ad-hoc groups. We run extensive experiments that showsubstantial improvements in group recommendation quality when accounting for affinity …,EDBT,2015,9
Parallelizing data processing on FPGAs with shifter lists,Louis Woods; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner,Abstract Parallelism is currently seen as a mechanism to minimize the impact of the powerand heat dissipation problems encountered in modern hardware. Data parallelism—basedon partitioning the data—and pipeline parallelism—based on partitioning the computation—are the two main approaches to leverage parallelism on a wide range of hardware platforms.Unfortunately; not all data processing problems are susceptible to either of those strategies.An example is the skyline operator [Börzsönyi et al. 2001]; which computes the set of Pareto-optimal points within a multidimensional dataset. Existing approaches to parallelize theskyline operator are based on data parallelism. As a result; they suffer from a high overheadwhen merging intermediate results because of the lack of a global view of the probleminherent to partitioning the input data.,ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS),2015,8
Scalable xquery type matching,Jens Teubner,Abstract XML Schema awareness has been an integral part of the XQuery language sinceits early design stages. Matching XML data against XML types is the main operation thatbacks up XQuery type expressions; such as typeswitch; instance of; or certain XPathoperators. This interaction is particularly vital in data-centric XQuery applications; wheredata come with detailed type information from an XML Schema document. So far there hasbeen little work on the optimization of those operations. This work presents an efficientimplementation of the runtime aspects of XML Schema support. We propose type ranks as anovel and uniform way to implement all facets of type matching in the W3C XQueryRecommendation. As a concise encoding of the type hierarchy defined by an XML Schemadocument; type ranks minimize the cost of checking the runtime type of XQuery singleton …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,8
Snowfall: Hardware stream analysis made easy,Jens Teubner; Louis Woods,Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are chip devices that can be runtime-reconfiguredto realize arbitrary processing tasks directly in hardware. Industrial products [Net; Xtr] as wellas research prototypes [MTA09; MVB+09; SLS+10; TMA11] demonstrated how thiscapability can be exploited to build highly efficient processors for data warehousing; datamining; or stream analysis tasks. On the flip side; the construction of dedicated hardwarecircuits requires considerable engineering efforts and skills that are often not available inapplication-focussed development teams. To bridge this gap; at ETH we have developed aset of tools that aid developers of high-performance stream processing solutions and enableagile hardware generation for changing application demands.,*,2011,7
Pathfinder: A relational query optimizer explores xquery terrain,Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner; Torsten Grust,Abstract Relational encodings of the static aspects of the XQuery data model; ie; tabularrepresentations for XML documents and ordered sequences of items; are widely used today.Since 2002; the Pathfinder and MonetDB/XQuery companion projects [BGvK+ 06] pursuethe primary goal to also embrace the complete dynamic semantics of XQuery (expressionevaluation and runtime aspects) with the help of relational database systems. In earlier work[GT04]; we have shown that relational algebra makes for a suitable target language in anXQuery compiler. This purely relational approach to XQuery inherits the scalabilityadvantages of the underlying relational database back-end and makes proven optimizationtechniques immediately applicable to the construction of XQuery processors.MonetDB/XQuery; an open-source system that implements this approach; is found among …,In Proc. of the 2007 BTW Conference (Datenbanksysteme für Business; Technologie und Web,2007,7
XLynx—an FPGA-based XML filter for hybrid XQuery processing,Jens Teubner; Louis Woods; Chongling Nie,Abstract While offering unique performance and energy-saving advantages; the use of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for database acceleration has demanded majorconcessions from system designers. Either the programmable chips have been used for verybasic application tasks (such as implementing a rigid class of selection predicates) or theircircuit definition had to be completely recompiled at runtime—a very CPU-intensive and time-consuming effort. This work eliminates the need for such concessions. As part of our XLynximplementation—an FPGA-based XML filter—we present skeleton automata; which is adesign principle for data-intensive hardware circuits that offers high expressiveness andquick reconfiguration at the same time. Skeleton automata provide a generic implementationfor a class of finite-state automata. They can be parameterized to any particular …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,6
Loop-lifted staircase join: from XPath to XQuery,Peter Alexander Boncz; Torsten Grust; Maurice vanKeulen; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,textabstractVarious techniques have been proposed for efficient evaluation of XPathexpressions; where the XPath location steps are rooted in a single sequence of contextnodes. Among these techniques; the staircase join allows to evaluate XPath location stepsalong arbitrary axes in at most one scan over the XML document; exploiting the XPathaccelerator encoding (aka. pre/post encoding). In XQuery; however; embedded XPath sub-expressions occur in arbitrarily nested for-loops. Thus; they are rooted in multiple sequencesof context nodes (one per iteration). Consequently; the previously proposed algorithms needto be applied repeatedly; requiring multiple scans over the XML document encoding. In thiswork; we present loop-lifted staircase join; an extension of the staircase join that allows toefficiently evaluate XPath sub-expressions in arbitrarily nested XQuery iteration scopes …,Information Systems [INS],2005,6
Bridging the GAP between relational and native XML storage with staircase join,Jens Teubner; Maurice van Keulen; Torsten Grust,Several mapping schemes have recently been proposed to store XML data in relationaltables. Relational database systems are readily available and can handle vast amounts ofdata very efficiently; taking advantage of physical properties that are specific to the relationalmodel; like sortedness or uniqueness. Tables that originate from XML documents; however;carry some further properties that cannot be exploited by current relational query processors.We propose a new join algorithm that is specifically designed to operate on XML datamapped to relational tables. The staircase join is fully aware of the underlying tree propertiesand allows for I/O and cache optimal query execution. As a local change to the databasekernel; it can easily be plugged into any relational database and allows for variousoptimization strategies; eg selection pushdown.

Data-intensive XQuery debugging with instant replay,Torsten Grust; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract We explore the design and implementation of Rover; a postmortem debugger forXQuery. Rather than being based on the traditional breakpoint model; Rover acknowledgesXQuery's nature as a functional language: the debugger follows a declarative debuggingparadigm in which a user is enabled to observe the values of selected XQuerysubexpressions. Rover has been designed to hook into Pathfinder; an XQuery compiler thatemits relational algebra plans for evaluation on commodity relational database back-ends.The debugger instruments the subject query with fn: trace () calls which; at query runtime;populate database tables with relational representations of XQuery item sequences. Thanksto Pathfinder's loop-lifting compilation strategy; a Rover trace (1) may span multiple XQueryfor iteration scopes and (2) allows for interactive debugging sessions that can arbitrarily …,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on XQuery implementation; experience and perspectives,2007,5
Flexible Analysis of Plant Genomes in a Database Management System.,Sebastian Dorok; Sebastian Breß; Jens Teubner; Gunter Saake,ABSTRACT Analysis of genomes has a wide range of applications from diseasesusceptibility studies to plant breeding research. For example; different types of barley havediffering characteristics regarding draught or salt tolerance. Thus; a typical use case iscomparing two plant genomes and try to deduce which genes are responsible for a certainresistance. For this; we need to find differences in large volumes of aligned genome data;which is already available in large genome databases. The challenge is to efficiently retrievethe genotypes of a certain range of the genome; and then; to determine variants and theirimpact on the plant organism.

Efficient Query Processing in Co-Processor-accelerated Databases,Sebastian Breß; Gunter Saake; Jens Teubner; Kai-Uwe Sattler,Abstract Advancements in hardware changed the bottleneck of modern database systemsfrom disk IO to main memory access and processing power. Since the performance ofmodern processors is primarily limited by a fixed energy budget; hardware vendors areforced to specialize processors. Consequently; processors become increasinglyheterogeneous; which already became commodity in the form of accelerated processingunits or dedicated co-processors such as graphics processing units. However; building arobust and efficient query engine for such heterogeneous co-processor environments is stilla significant challenge. Although the database community developed fast parallel algorithmsfor a large number of heterogeneous processors; we still require methods to use theseprocessors efficiently during query processing.,*,2015,3
MXQuery with hardware acceleration,Peter M Fischer; Jens Teubner,We demonstrate MXQuery/H; a modified version of MXQuery that uses hardwareacceleration to speed up XML processing. The main goal of this demonstration is to give aninteractive example of hardware/software co-design and show how system performance andenergy efficiency can be improved by off-loading tasks to FPGA hardware. To this end; weequipped MXQuery/H with various hooks to inspect the different parts of the system. Besidesthat; our system can finally really leverage the idea of XML projection. Though the idea ofprojection had been around for a while; its effectiveness remained always limited because ofthe unavoidable and high parsing overhead. By performing the task in hardware; we relievethe software part from this overhead and achieve processing speed-ups of several factors.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,3

Efficient storage and analysis of genome data in relational database systems,Sebastian Dorok,Abstract Genome analysis allows researchers to reveal insights about the genetic makeup ofliving organisms. In the near future; genome analysis will become a key means in thedetection and treatment of diseases that are based on variations of the genetic makeup. Tothis end; powerful variant detection tools were developed or are still under development.However; genome analysis faces a large data deluge. The amounts of data that areproduced in a typical genome analysis experiment easily exceed several 100 gigabytes. Atthe same time; the number of genome analysis experiments increases as the costs drop.Thus; the reliable and efficient management and analysis of large amounts of genome datawill likely become a bottleneck; if we do not improve current genome data management andanalysis solutions.,*,2017,1
The relational XQuery puzzle: a look-back on the pieces found so far,Jens Teubner,Abstract Given the tremendous versatility of relational database implementations toward awide range of database problems; it seems only natural to consider them as back-ends forXML data processing. Yet; the assumptions behind the language XQuery are considerablydifferent to those in traditional RDBMSs. The underlying data model is a tree; data andresults carry an intrinsic order; queries are described using explicit iteration and; after all;problems are everything else but regular. Solving the relational XQuery puzzle; therefore;has challenged a number of research groups over the past years. The purpose of this articleis to summarize and assess some of the results that have been obtained during this periodto solve the puzzle.

Efficient Main-Memory Hash Joins on Multi-Core CPUs: Does Hardware Still Matter,Cagri Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Ozsu,ABSTRACT The architectural changes introduced with multi-core CPUs have triggered aredesign of main-memory join algorithms. In the last few years; two diverging views haveappeared. One approach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the parameters ofthe architecture (cache sizes; TLB; and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues thatmodern hardware is good enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and;consequently; the careful tailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In thispaper we resolve this conflict through an extensive experimental analysis of the designspace using different algorithms and architectures. We have taken the algorithms presentedin previous work and reimplemented them so that their results are comparable.

Energy Efficiency in Main-Memory Databases,Stefan Noll; Henning Funke; Jens Teubner,Abstract As the operating costs of today's data centres continue to increase and processormanufacturers are forced to meet thermal design power constraints when designing newhardware; the energy efficiency of a main-memory database management system becomesmore and more important. Plus; lots of database workloads are more memory-intensive thancompute-intensive; which results in computing power being unused and wasted. This canbecome a problem because wasting computing also means wasting electrical power. In thispaper; we experimentally study the impact of reducing the clock frequency of the processorand the impact of using fewer processor cores on the energy efficiency of common databasealgorithms such as scans; simple aggregations; simple hash joins; and state-of-the-art joinalgorithms.

Taken together; these trends frame ascenario that makes sense from many points of view (usability; scalability; flexibility;development cost) but is also radically different from what we know today. It is fair to say thata coherent answer to the challenges raised by the combination of these trends has yet toemerge from either academia or industry. From an academic perspective; these challengesare particularly difficult because they imply a considerable departure from establishedprocedures. To start with; multicore computers; the virtualization of computing platforms; andthe replacement of the one-computer-one-local-copy-ofa-program approach by cloud …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2009,*

Report INS-E0510 May 2005,PA Boncz; T Grust; M van Keulen; S Manegold; J Rittinger; J Teubner,ABSTRACT Various techniques have been proposed for efficient evaluation of XPathexpressions; where the XPath location steps are rooted in a single sequence of contextnodes. Among these techniques; the staircase join allows to evaluate XPath location stepsalong arbitrary axes in at most one scan over the XML document; exploiting the XPathaccelerator encoding (aka. pre/post encoding).,*,2005,*
REPORT INS-E0503 MARCH 2005,PA Boncz; T Grust; S Manegold; J Rittinger; J Teubner,ABSTRACT Using a relational DBMS as back-end engine for an XQuery processing systemleverages relational query optimization and scalable query processing strategies providedby mature DBMS engines in the XML domain. Though a lot of theoretical work has beendone in this area and various solutions have been proposed; no complete systems havebeen made available so far to give the practical evidence that this is a viable approach. Inthis paper; we describe the ourely relational XQuery processor Pathfinder that has been builton top of the extensible RDBMS MonetDB. Performance results indicate that the system iscapable of evaluating XQuery queries efficiently; even if the input XML documents becomehuge. We additionally present further contributions such as loop-lifted staircase join;techniques to derive order properties and to reduce sorting effort in the generated …,*,2005,*

Efficient Joins on Heterogeneous Processors,Henning Funke; Sebastian Breß; Stefan Noll; Jens Teubner,ABSTRACT Coprocessor hardware like graphics processors is frequently used to acceleratecomputations. Many applications achieve an increased throughput when processing datathat is cached on the coprocessor; compared to the host processor alone. This does usuallynot apply to real world applications for two reasons. Firstly data sizes often exceed acoprocessor's memory capacity. Secondly it is desirable to compute on all availableprocessors simultaneously and to manage the load condition; the work should be distributedevenly between processors. For both reasons extensive data transfers are necessary; whichhas lead to blaming the bus systems to be the dominating bottleneck for coprocessing.Especially for memory intensive workloads like in database query processing theadvantages can marginalize when data transfers and memory accesses are not used …,*,*,*
FPGAs for Dynamic (XML) Query Workloads,Chongling Nie; Jens Teubner; Louis Woods,ABSTRACT While the performance opportunities of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)for high-volume query processing are well known; complicated and tedious querycompilation procedures still defeat the use of the technology for dynamic query workloads;which are relevant in practice. In this work we report on an FPGA-based stream processingengine that does not have this limitation. We provide a hardware implementation of XMLprojection [9] that can be reconfigured in less than a micro-second and thus supports evenhighly dynamic query workloads. Our work brings the architectural advantages of FPGAtechnology to the XML world. Using our system; XML streams can be filtered in the network;saving network bandwidth; client-side parsing; and expensive pre-processing.,*,*,*
