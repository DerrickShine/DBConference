Linkage analysis of IL4 and other chromosome 5q31. 1 markers and total serum immunoglobulin E concentrations,David G Marsh; John D Neely; Daniel R Breazeale; Balaram Ghosh; Linda R Freidhoff; Eva Ehrlich-Kautzky; Carsten Schou; Guha Krishnaswamy; Terri H Beaty,Sib-pair analysis of 170 individuals from 11 Amish families revealed evidence for linkage offive markers in chromosome 5q31. 1 with a gene controlling total serum immunoglobulin E(IgE) concentration. No linkage was found between these markers and specific IgE antibodyconcentrations. Analysis of total IgE within a subset of 128 IgE antibody-negative sib pairsconfirmed evidence for linkage to 5q31. 1; especially to the interleukin-4 gene (IL4). Acombination of segregation and maximum likelihood analyses provided further evidence forthis linkage. These analyses suggest that IL4 or a nearby gene in 5q31. 1 regulates IgEproduction in a nonantigen-specific (noncognate) fashion.,Science,1994,1203
Long-term exercise and atherogenic activity of blood mononuclear cells in persons at risk of developing ischemic heart disease,J Kelly Smith; Rhesa Dykes; John E Douglas; Guha Krishnaswamy; Steven Berk,ContextIncreasing evidence demonstrates that atherosclerosis is an immunologicallymediated disease in which the secretion of atherogenic and atheroprotective cytokines; byinfiltrating blood mononuclear cells; plays an important role.

Human endothelium as a source of multifunctional cytokines: molecular regulation and possible role in human disease,Guha Krishnaswamy; Jim Kelley; Lakshminarayan Yerra; J Kelly Smith; David S Chi,Endothelial cells; by virtue of their capacity to express adhesion molecules and cytokines;are intricately involved in inflammatory processes. Endothelial cells have been shown toexpress interleukin-1 (IL-1); IL-5; IL-6; IL-8; IL-11; IL-15; several colony-stimulating factors(CSF); granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF); macrophage CSF (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophageCSF (GM-CSF); and the chemokines; monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1); RANTES;and growth-related oncogene protein-alpha (GRO-alpha). IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) produced by infiltrating inflammatory cells can induce endothelial cells toexpress several of these cytokines as well as adhesion molecules. Induction of thesecytokines in endothelial cells has been demonstrated by such diverse processes as hypoxiaand bacterial infection. Recent studies have demonstrated that adhesive interactions …,Journal of interferon & cytokine research,1999,399
The human mast cell: functions in physiology and disease.,G Krishnaswamy; J Kelley; D Johnson; G Youngberg; W Stone; SK Huang; J Bieber; DS Chi,Abstract Mast cells are multifunctional; tissue-dwelling cells capable of secreting a widevariety of mediators. They develop from bone marrow-derived progenitor cells; primed withstem cell factor (SCF); which mediates its actions by interacting with the SCF receptor or c-kiton the cell surface. Mast cells continue their maturation and differentiation in peripheraltissue; developing into two well described subsets of cells; MCT and MCTC cells; varying incontent of tryptase and chymase as well as in immunobiology. Mast cells are activated bynumerous stimuli; including antigen (acting via the high affinity IgE receptor; Fc?

Following activation; these cells express mediators such as histamine;leukotrienes and prostanoids; as well as proteases; and many cytokines and chemokines …,*,2001,252
The role of human mast cell-derived cytokines in eosinophil biology,Bita Shakoory; S Matthew Fitzgerald; Steven A Lee; David S Chi; Guha Krishnaswamy,Eosinophil-mediated diseases; such as allergic asthma; eosinophilic fasciitis; and certainhypersensitivity pulmonary disorders; are characterized by eosinophil infiltration and tissueinjury. Mast cells and T cells often colocalize to these areas. Recent data suggest that mastcells can contribute to eosinophil-mediated inflammatory responses. Activation of mast cellscan occur by antigen and immunoglobulin E (IgE) via the highaffinity receptor (FcεRI) for IgE.The liberation of proteases; leukotrienes; lipid mediators; and histamine can contribute totissue inflammation and allow recruitment of eosinophils to tissue. In addition; the synthesisand expression of a plethora of cytokines and chemokines (such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]; interleukin-1 [IL-1]; IL-3; IL-5; tumornecrosis factor-α [TNF-α]; and the chemokines IL-8; regulated upon activation normal T …,Journal of interferon & cytokine research,2004,233
A newly developed PCR assay ofH. pylori in gastric biopsy; saliva; and feces,Chuanfu Li; Tuanzhu Ha; Donald A Ferguson; David S Chi; Rongguo Zhao; Nikihil R Patel; Guha Krishnaswamy; Eapen Thomas,Abstract We have recently developed a new PCR assay for the detection of H. pylori. In thisstudy; the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to detect H. pylori in 88 gastricbiopsy; 85 saliva; and 71 fecal specimens from 88 patients. H. pylori infection was confirmedin 71 of 88 patients by culture and/or histological stain of gastric biopsies. Serum IgGantibody to H. pylori was also measured and resulted in 97% sensitivity and 94% specificity.H. pylori DNA was detected by the PCR assay in gastric biopsy specimens from all 71patients (100% sensitivity) with proven gastric H. pylori infection but not from 17 noninfectedpatients (100% specificity). In saliva specimens; H. pylori DNA was identified in 57 of the 68patients (84%) with proven gastric H. pylori infection and in three of the 17 patients withoutgastric H. pylori infection. However; the PCR assay was only able to detect H. pylori DNA …,Digestive diseases and sciences,1996,210

Identification of a novel cytokine; ML-1; and its expression in subjects with asthma,Mio Kawaguchi; Luiz F Onuchic; Xiao-Dong Li; David M Essayan; John Schroeder; Hui-Qing Xiao; Mark C Liu; Guha Krishnaswamy; Gregory Germino; Shau-Ku Huang,A novel gene; designated ML-1; was identified from a human genomic DNA clone andhuman T cell cDNA sequences. The second exon of ML-1 gene shares significant sequenceidentity with the gene encoding IL-17 (IL-17). ML-1 gene expression was up-regulated inactivated PBMCs; CD4+ T cells; allergen-specific Th0; Th1; and Th2 clones; activatedbasophils; and mast cells. Increased expression of the ML-1 gene; but not IL-17; was seenfollowing allergen challenge in four asthmatic subjects; suggesting its role in allergicinflammatory responses. ML-1 from transiently transfected COS-7 cells was able to inducegene expression and protein production for IL-6 and IL-8 (at 10 ng/ml of ML-1: for IL-6;599.6±19.1 pg/ml; for IL-8; 1724.2±132.9 pg/ml; and at 100 ng/ml of ML-1: for IL-6;1005.3±55.6 pg/ml; for IL-8; 4371.4±280.5 pg/ml; p< 0.05 for both doses vs baseline) in …,The Journal of Immunology,2001,181
Insulin: a novel factor in carcinogenesis,K Gupta; G Krishnaswamy; A Karnad; AN Peiris,ABSTRACT Cancer is a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Despite muchresearch on specific carcinogens; the cause of many cancers remains unclear. Theidentification of novel causative agents offers the potential for cancer prevention. Diseasessuch as obesity and diabetes mellitus; characterized by hyperinsulinemia; are associatedwith increased risk of endometrial; colorectal; and breast carcinomas. There is increasingevidence that insulin is a growth factor for tumor formation. The mechanisms underlyinginsulin-mediated neoplasia may include enhanced DNA synthesis with resultant tumor cellgrowth; inhibition of apoptosis; and altered sex hormone milieu. The reduced insulin levelsseen with physical activity; weight loss; and a high fiber diet may account for decreasedcancer risk.

The effects of HIV infection on endothelial function,David Chi; Jason Henry; Jim Kelley; Rebecca Thorpe; John Kelly Smith; Guha Krishnaswamy,Endothelial dysfunction and/or injury is pivotal to the development of cardiovascular andinflammatory pathology. Endothelial dysfunction and/or injury has been described in HumanImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Elaboration of circulating markers of endothelialactivation; such as soluble adhesion molecules and procoagulant proteins; occurs in HIVinfection. Certain endothelial cells; such as those lining liver sinusoids; human umbilicalvein endothelial cells; bone marrow stromal endothelial cells or brain microvascularendothelial cells; have been shown to be variably permissive for HIV infection. Entry of virusinto endothelial cells may occur via CD4 antigen or galactosyl-ceramide receptors. Othermechanisms of entry including chemokine receptors have been proposed.

Inflammatory aspects of sleep apnea and their cardiovascular consequences,E Kasasbeh; David S Chi; G Krishnaswamy,Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common medical condition that occurs in aconsiderable percentage of the population. Substantial evidence shows that patients withOSA have an increased incidence of hypertension compared with individuals without OSA;and that OSA is a risk factor for the development of hypertension. It is established that OSAmay be implicated in stroke and transient ischemic attacks. OSA is associated with coronaryheart disease; heart failure; and cardiac arrhythmias. Pulmonary hypertension may beassociated with OSA; especially in patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease. Althoughthe exact cause that links OSA with cardiovascular disease is unknown; there is evidencethat OSA is associated with a group of proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors that havebeen identified as important in the development of atherosclerosis.

Chronic granulomatous disease: a review of the infectious and inflammatory complications,EunKyung Song; Gayatri Bala Jaishankar; Hana Saleh; Warit Jithpratuck; Ryan Sahni; Guha Krishnaswamy,Chronic Granulomatous Disease is the most commonly encountered immunodeficiencyinvolving the phagocyte; and is characterized by repeated infections with bacterial andfungal pathogens; as well as the formation of granulomas in tissue. The disease is the resultof a disorder of the NADPH oxidase system; culminating in an inability of the phagocyte togenerate superoxide; leading to the defective killing of pathogenic organisms. This can leadto infections with Staphylococcus aureus; Psedomonas species; Nocardia species; andfungi (such as Aspergillus species and Candida albicans). Involvement of vital or largeorgans can contribute to morbidity and/or mortality in the affected patients. Major advanceshave occurred in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease; with the potential for genetherapy or stem cell transplantation looming on the horizon.,*,2011,132
The molecular role of mast cells in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,Jim L Kelley; David S Chi; Wael Abou-Auda; J Kelly Smith; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Human atherosclerosis has many characteristics of an inflammatory disorder.Recent data suggest that mast cells might be important in the pathogenesis ofatherosclerotic disease. By secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines; mast cells can assist inthe recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes into vascular tissue; thereby propagating theinflammatory response. Mast cell enzymes might activate pro-metalloproteinases; therebydestabilizing atheromatous plaques. Mast cells can facilitate foam cell formation bypromoting cholesterol accumulation. However; mast cell tryptase could slow thrombusformation at sites of plaque rupture by interfering with coagulation. Therefore; mast cells canmodulate coronary artery disease by both facilitatory and inhibitory pathways.,Molecular medicine today,2000,125

Dermatology for the practicing allergist: Tinea pedis and its complications,Muhannad Al Hasan; S Matthew Fitzgerald; Mahnaz Saoudian; Guha Krishnaswamy,Tinea pedis is a chronic fungal infection of the feet; very often observed in patients who areimmuno-suppressed or have diabetes mellitus. The practicing allergist may be called uponto treat this disease for various reasons. Sometimes tinea infection may be mistaken foratopic dermatitis or allergic eczema. In other patients; tinea pedis may complicate allergyand asthma and may contribute to refractory atopic disease. Patients with recurrent cellulitismay be referred to the allergist/immunologist for an immune evaluation and discovered tohave tinea pedis as a predisposing factor. From a molecular standpoint; superficial fungalinfections may induce a type2 T helper cell response (Th2) that can aggravate atopy. Th2cytokines may induce eosinophil recruitment and immunoglobulin E (IgE) class switching byB cells; thereby leading to exacerbation of atopic conditions. Three groups of fungal …,*,2004,70

Potential mechanisms connecting asthma; esophageal reflux; and obesity/sleep apnea complex—a hypothetical review,Aiman Kasasbeh; Ehab Kasasbeh; Guha Krishnaswamy,Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma are potentially linked at several levels.The pathophysiology of these two conditions seems to overlap significantly; as airwayobstruction; inflammation; obesity; and several other factors are implicated in thedevelopment of both diseases. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); cardiovascularcomplications; obesity itself; and the underlying inflammatory processes are all complexcontributory factors that provide hypothetical links. Furthermore; a collateral rise inprevalence of both OSA and asthma has been noticed during the past few years; occurringin association with the emerging epidemic of obesity; a common risk factor for bothconditions. OSA and asthma share many other risk factors as well. We propose ahypothetical OSA–asthma relationship that has implications on the diagnosis and …,Sleep medicine reviews,2007,57

Human lung fibroblasts express interleukin-6 in response to signaling after mast cell contact,S Matthew Fitzgerald; Steven A Lee; H Kenton Hall; David S Chi; Guha Krishnaswamy,Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Mast cell–derived cytokines maymediate both airway inflammation and remodeling. It has also been shown that fibroblastscan be the source of proinflammatory cytokines. In the human airways; mast cell–fibroblastinteractions may have pivotal effects on modulating inflammation. To study this further; wecocultured normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) with a human mast cell line (HMC-1) andassayed for production of interleukin (IL)-6; an important proinflammatory cytokine. Whencultured together; NHLF/HMC-1 contact induced IL-6 secretion. Separation of HMC-1 andNHLF cells by a porous membrane inhibited this induction. HMC-1–derived cellularmembranes caused an increase in IL-6 production in NHLF. Activation of p38 MAPK wasalso seen in cocultures by Western blot; whereas IL-6 production in cocultures was …,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2004,46
The cardiovascular and metabolic complications of HIV infection.,Guha Krishnaswamy; DAVID S Chi; Jim L Kelley; Felix Sarubbi; JK Smith; ALAN Peiris,Abstract With the advent of more effective therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infection; HIV-infected patients are living longer and cardiovascular disease is becomingmore obvious in this population. Patients with HIV infection represent one of the most rapidlydeveloping groups with cardiovascular disease globally. Cardiovascular diseasecomplicating HIV infection is likely to contribute to burgeoning healthcare costs. Pericarditis;myocarditis; cardiomyopathy; atherosclerotic coronary vasculopathy; arterial aneurysms;pulmonary hypertension; and endocarditis occur with increased frequency in these patients.Pericardial tamponade; dilated cardiomyopathy; endocarditis; and vasculopathy can lead tofatal outcomes in this population.

Severe asthma and the omalizumab option,Christopher WT Miller; Narayanaswamy Krishnaswamy; Chambless Johnston; Guha Krishnaswamy,Atopic diseases and asthma are increasing at a remarkable rate on a global scale. It is nowwell recognized that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Theinflammatory process in many patients is driven by an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependentprocess. Mast cell activation and release of mediators; in response to allergen and IgE;results in a cascade response; culminating in B lymphocyte; T lymphocyte; eosinophil;fibroblast; smooth muscle cell and endothelial activation. This complex cellular interaction;release of cytokines; chemokines and growth factors and inflammatory remodeling of theairways leads to chronic asthma. A subset of patients develops severe airway disease whichcan be extremely morbid and even fatal. While many treatments are available for asthma; itis still a chronic and incurable disease; characterized by exacerbation; hospitalizations …,*,2008,43
Detection of allergen-and mitogen-induced human cytokine transcripts using a competitive polymerase chain reaction,Shau-Ku Huang; David M Essayan; Guha Krishnaswamy; Ming Yi; Megumi Kumai; Song-Nan Su; Hui-Qing Xiao; Mark C Liu,Abstract Human cytokines; IL-4; IL-5; and IFN-γ play an important role in the regulation of IgEsynthesis and atopic diseases. In this communication; we describe the development of aquantitative assay of steady-state cytokine mRNAs (IL-4; IL-5; and IFN-γ) from a variety ofcell sources; including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with either amitogen (PHA) or ragweed pollen allergen extract; and cells from allergen-challengedinflammatory sites. Quantitative analysis of IL-5; IL-4 and IFN-γ transcripts was achieved by acompetitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique usinginternal standard (IS) _cRNAs in the presence of specific oligonucleotide primers. Each ISwas generated from a plasmid vector contining the respective cytokine cDNA modified byinsertion with an SV40-DNA fragment.

Prostaglandin H synthase expression is variable in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines,Judy Parker; Mike K Kaplon; Consuelo J Alvarez; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract The expression of prostaglandin H synthases can be induced by many stimuli andis likely to be important in control of the cell cycle. The analysis of prostaglandin H synthase-1 and-2 expression in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines is a useful model system for studyingthe function of the prostaglandin H synthases; especially with regard to proliferation andadhesion. Prostaglandin H synthase-1 protein is not found in any of eight human colonadenocarcinoma cell lines. Expression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 is variable for theeight cell lines: three constitutively expressed active protein; four did not express this gene atall; and one had mRNA but no active protein. Thus; five colorectal adenocarcinoma cell linesexhibit “null” expression of prostaglandin synthase-2. The three cell lines with constitutiveexpression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 produce PGE 2.

Paul Ehrlich’’s “; Mastzellen”—From Aniline Dyes to DNA Chip Arrays,Harsha Vyas; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract It has been more than a century since the discovery of the mast cell by the geniusand tenacity of Paul Ehrlich; who described this cell when he was a medical student. Onecannot deny that this discovery also coincides with the golden age of immunology. Thediscovery of this important cell type in immunological history was no serendipity: it was aresult of Ehrlich's prodigious laboratory talent and his ability to combine intuition anddeduction despite the limited resources of his times. Since then; we have learned muchmore about the immune response; immunoglobulin E; and the development and function ofmast cells in various pathological states. What follows is a review of Paul Ehrlich's discoveryof the mast cell (mästzellen) and a chronological review of subsequent developments inmast cell research; including the recent use of proteomics and genomics to understand …,*,2006,41
Molecular regulation of interleukin-13 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in human mast cells by interleukin-1β,Steven A Lee; S Matthew Fitzgerald; Shau K Huang; Chuanfu Li; David S Chi; Denise M Milhorn; Guha Krishnaswamy,Mast cells play pivotal roles in immunoglobulin (Ig) E–mediated airway inflammation;expressing interleukin (IL)-13 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); which inturn regulate IgE synthesis and/or inflammatory cell recruitment. The molecular effects of IL-1β on cytokine expression by human mast cells (HMC) have not been studied well. In thisreport; we provide evidence that human umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells (CBDMC)and HMC-1 cells express the type 1 receptor for IL-1. We also demonstrate that IL-1β andtumor necrosis factor-α are able to induce; individually or additively; dose-dependentexpression of IL-13 and MCP-1 in these cells. The induction of IL-13 and MCP-1 geneexpression by IL-1β was accompanied by the activation of IL-1 receptor–associated kinaseand translocation of the transcription factor; nuclear factor (NF) κB into the nucleus …,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2004,38
Regulation of eosinophil-active cytokine production from human cord blood-derived mast cells,Guha Krishnaswamy; Kenton Hall; George Youngberg; Fred Hossler; David Johnson; William A Block; Shau-Ku Huang; Jim Kelley; David S Chi,Human mast cells are multifunctional tissue-dwelling cells that play a crucial role ineosinophil-dependent disorders; such as asthma and parasitic diseases; by the secretion ofeosinophil-active mediators. Mast cell-derived cytokines; generated in response to cross-linking of the high-affinity IgE receptor; can regulate eosinophil activation; survival; andchemotaxis. In this study; mast cells generated from human cord blood progenitors (stemcells) were studied for eosinophil-active inflammatory cytokine expression. Cord blood-derived mast cells (CBDMC) expressed typical intracellular scroll granules and microvilli-likestructures on their cell surfaces; demonstrated the presence of tryptase; and elaboratedprostaglandin D2 (PGD2) after cross-linkage of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc ε RI).CBDMC expressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the eosinophil-active growth …,Journal of interferon & cytokine research,2002,38

Mast cell activation by lipoproteins,Jim Kelley; Gregory Hemontolor; Walid Younis; Chuanfu Li; Guha Krishnaswamy; David S Chi,Abstract Mast cells are activated by a number of agents that act independently fromimmunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity. One of these agents is oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). OxLDL has been implicated in the pathogenesis ofatherosclerosis and has been shown to induce microvascular dysfunction by the activationof mast cells. In this chapter; we describe the method for isolation of human LDL; oxidation ofLDL; and demonstrate that oxLDL activates mast cells by measuring messenger ribonucleicacid (mRNA) levels and protein levels of interleukin (IL)-8 an inflammatory cytokine. IL-8 is apotent chemoattractant for neutrophils and monocytes; which would result in a chronicinflammatory response. IL-8 mRNA levels were measured by reverse-transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and protein levels by enzyme-linked immunoassay.,*,2006,37
HIV-1 Tat protein-induced VCAM-1 expression in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells and its signaling,Kai Liu; David S Chi; Chuanfu Li; H Kenton Hall; Denise M Milhorn; Guha Krishnaswamy,Expression of cell adhesion molecule in endothelial cells upon activation by humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with the development of atheroscleroticvasculopathy. We postulated that induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)by HIV-1 Tat protein in endothelial cells might represent an early event that could culminatein inflammatory cell recruitment and vascular injury. We determined the role of HIV-1 Tatprotein in VCAM-1 expression in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC). HIV-1Tat protein treatment significantly increased cell-surface expression of VCAM-1 in HPAEC.Consistently; mRNA expression of VCAM-1 was also increased by HIV-1 Tat protein asmeasured by RT-PCR.

Ourprevious study has shown that IL-1 can induce mast cells to produce proinflammatorycytokines which are involved in atherogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine theeffects of epinephrine on IL-1-induced proatherogenic cytokine production from mast cells.Two ml of HMC-1 (0.75× 106 cells/ml) were cultured with epinephrine (1× 10-5 M) in thepresence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 hrs. HMC-1 cultured alone produced none totrace amounts of IL-6; IL-8; and IL-13. IL-1β significantly induced production of thesecytokines in HMC-1; while epinephrine alone did not. However; IL-6; IL-8; and IL-13production induced by IL-1β were significantly enhanced by addition of epinephrine. The …,BMC immunology,2004,36
Lymphoblastoid interferon-α inhibits T cell proliferation and expression of eosinophil-activating cytokines,Guha Krishnaswamy; John K Smith; Sujata Srikanth; David S Chi; John H Kalbfleisch; SHAU-KU HUANG,T cell-derived cytokines; such as interleukin-5 (IL-5) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activate eosinophils; whereas other cytokines; such as tumornecrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-13; determine eosinophil recruitment. Interferon-α (IFN-α); aleukocyte-derived cytokine; has been shown to have beneficial effects in eosinophil-mediated disorders; such as the hypereosinophilic syndrome and a murine model of allergicasthma; where it inhibited eosinophil recruitment. We tested the hypothesis that IFN-α actedin eosinophil-mediated disorders by modulating T cell cytokine expression. Peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMC) or human ragweed-specific TH1 (2B8) and TH2 (2D2) T cellclones were cultured in the presence of 5 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or 25 μg/ml ofantigen Amb a 1 (short ragweed allergen); respectively; and lymphoblastoid IFN-α …,Journal of interferon & cytokine research,1996,36

Induction of p38-and gC1qR-dependent IL-8 expression in pulmonary fibroblasts by soluble hepatitis C core protein,Jonathan P Moorman; S Matthew Fitzgerald; Deborah C Prayther; Steven A Lee; David S Chi; Guha Krishnaswamy,Recent studies suggest that HCV infection is associated with progressive declines inpulmonary function in patients with underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma andchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Few molecular studies have addressed theinflammatory aspects of HCV-associated pulmonary disease. Because IL-8 plays afundamental role in reactive airway diseases; we examined IL-8 signaling in normal humanlung fibroblasts (NHLF) in response to the HCV nucleocapsid core protein; a viral antigenshown to modulate intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation; apoptosisand inflammation. NHLF were treated with HCV core protein and assayed for IL-8expression; phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK pathway; and for the effect of p38 inhibition.Our studies demonstrate that soluble HCV core protein induces significant increases in …,Respiratory research,2005,29

X-linked agammaglobulinemia diagnosed late in life: case report and review of the literature,Justin R Sigmon; Ehab Kasasbeh; Guha Krishnaswamy,Common variable immune deficiency (CVID); one of the most common primaryimmunodeficiency diseases presents in adults; whereas X-linked agammaglobulinemia(XLA); an inherited humoral immunodeficiency; is usually diagnosed early in life aftermaternal Igs have waned. However; there have been several reports in the world literaturein which individuals have either had a delay in onset of symptoms or have beenmisdiagnosed with CVID and then later found to have mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase(BTK) yielding a reclassification as adult-onset variants of XLA. The typical finding of absentB cells should suggest XLA rather than CVID and may be a sensitive test to detect thiscondition; leading to the more specific test (Btk mutational analysis).

The diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism.(Featured CME Topic: Thyroid Dysfunction/Disease),Bhuvana Guha; Guha Krishnaswamy; Alan Peiris,HYPOTHYROIDISM REFERS TO a metabolic state resulting from a deficiency in thyroidhormone function. It usually arises from primary thyroid disease; but in rare cases it is due tohypothalamic-pituitary disease or generalized tissue resistance to thyroid hormone.'Themanifestations of hypothyroidism are well described and can affect virtually any organ. Theearly recognition of hypothyroidism remains a challenge; especially when the decline inthyroid function is gradual. In some instances; the manifestations of hypothyroidism may beerroneously attributed to the effects of aging in the elderly. Clinical suspicion ofhypothyroidism justifies laboratory testing.

Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia: a case report and review of the literature.,Said B Iskandar; Bhuvana Guha; Guha Krishnaswamy; Thomas M Roy,Abstract Bacteria that constitute the genus Acinetobacter were originally identified in the firstdecade of the 20th century. However; it was not until the last decade that its role as anopportunistic pathogen was fully appreciated. It is now clear that Acinetobacter is animportant cause of nosocomial infection and contributes significantly to the patient'smorbidity and mortality. The prevalence of infection with A. baumannii has increasedsignificantly during the last decade. At the same time; A. baumannii has developed one ofthe most impressive patterns of antibiotic resistance ever observed; establishing it as animportant nosocomial pathogen. It has been nicknamed the" Gram-negative MRSA"because of its frequent resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

Angiopoietin-1 inhibits doxorubicin-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell death by modulating fas expression and via the PI3K/Akt pathway,Deling Yin; Chuanfu Li; Race L Kao; Tuanzhu Ha; Guha Krishnaswamy; Matthew Fitzgerald; Charles A Stuart,Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) is essential for the maturation of blood vessels duringvasculogenesis. Besides angiogenesis; recent publications indicate that Ang-1 is also apotent survival factor for endothelial cells; however; the mechanisms by which pathwaysremain elusive. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a powerful anticancer drug; but its use is severelyrestricted by its cardiotoxicity. The authors report here that Ang-1 inhibits DOX-induced celldeath in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Interestingly; the DOX-inducedup-regulation in Fas (CD95/APO-1) and Fas ligand expression could be blocked by Ang-1;indicating a pivotal role of Ang-1 in DOX-induced Fas and Fas ligand expression.

Molecular defects in the mannose binding lectin pathway in dermatological disease: Case report and literature review,Christopher Miller; Sara Wilgenbusch; Mini Michael; David S Chi; George Youngberg; Guha Krishnaswamy,Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the Mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases(MASPs) are an essential aspect of innate immune responses that probably play animportant but understudied role in cutaneous function. The MBL-MASP pathway appears toexert its primary role by assisting in the clearance of apoptotic skin cells (thus preventingaccumulation and a subsequent autoimmune response) and promotingopsonophagocytosis of invading pathogens; limiting their dissemination. Deficiencies of thepathway have been described and are associated with infectious; autoimmune and vascularcomplications. However; the role of this pathway in dermatological disease is essentiallyunexplored.

Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: a serious but preventable disorder,Christopher WT Miller; Bhuvana Guha; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Described for the first time approximately 30 years ago; exercise-inducedanaphylaxis is a rare disorder characterized by development of a severe allergic responseoccurring after mild-to-strenuous physical activity. This disorder is especially important torecognize with the recent increase in physical activity and health fitness fads. A number ofpredisposing factors (eg; prior ingestion of particular food groups) linked to exercise-inducedanaphylaxis has been outlined over the years. Mechanisms governing the condition are stillbeing unveiled; and it is likely that one mechanism involves mast cell degranulation andinflammatory mediator generation resulting from the biochemical effects of exercise;sometimes in the presence of an ingested allergen such that wheat or shell fish.

We have reported that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) significantly increasedIL-6 and IL-8 production in IL-1β-activated human mast cell line (HMC-1). Baicalein (BAI)has anti-inflammatory properties and inhibits IL-1β-and TNF-α-induced inflammatorycytokine production from HMC-1. The goal of the present study was to examine the effect ofBAI on IL-6 and IL-8 production from CSE-treated and IL-1β-activated HMC-1. Main-stream(Ms) and Side-stream (Ss) cigarette smoke were collected onto fiber filters and extracted inRPMI-1640 medium. Two ml of HMC-1 at 1× 106 cells/mL were cultured with CSE in thepresence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 24 hrs. A group of HMC-1 cells stimulated …,Clinical and Molecular Allergy,2012,14

Persistent urticarial eruption in an asthmatic patient.,Raghu Mukkamala; Nawras Baban; Guha Krishnaswamy; John Kelly Smith,Abstract This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing urticarial vasculitis inpatients with chronic urticarial eruptions. The salient points in history that point towards thediagnosis of urticarial vasculitis include the presence of painful urticarial lesions that lastlonger than 24 hours and that heal leaving residual pigmentation. In some cases theurticaria may evolve into palpable purpura. An associated systemic illness that mayresemble systemic lupus erythematosus should also suggest the diagnosis; which isestablished by skin biopsy. Histopathology reveals a leukocytoclastic vasculitis involvingpostcapillary venules. When associated with systemic vasculitis; the urticaria is likely to be ofthe hypocomplementemic variety; with immunoglobulin and complement deposition onbiopsies; and with serum complement studies demonstrating classical pathway activation …,Annals of allergy; asthma & immunology: official publication of the American College of Allergy; Asthma; & Immunology,1996,13

The two main intestinal lipoproteins are chylomicron (CM) and very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL). Unfortunately; studies on the CM biogenesis and intestinaltransport of dietary fats have been hampered by the lack of an adequate in vitro model. Inthis study; we investigated the possible factors that might increase the efficiency of CMproduction by Caco‐2 cells. We utilized sequential NaCl gradient ultracentrifugation toisolate the CMs that were secreted by the Caco‐2 cells. To confirm the successful isolationof the CMs; we performed Fat Red 7B staining; TG reading; apolipoprotein B (ApoB)measurement; and transmission electron microcopy (TEM) analysis.

Immunologic investigations of T-cell regulation of human IgE antibody secretion and allergic responses,David M Essayan; Guha Krishnaswamy; Shau-Ku Huang,Abstract The pathophysiology of allergic disease is multifactorial; involving an intricatenetwork of interactions among cells; mediators; and cytokines. Substantial progress hasbeen made in defining the role of antigen-specific T cells and cytokines in the regulation ofimmunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis and the atopic diseases. The development of antigen-specific T-cell lines and clones has facilitated efforts to characterize human T-cell subsetsand their cytokine repertoires. Molecular methods currently available include techniques forthe quantitative analysis of cytokine gene expression and secretion from activated T cellsexvivoas well as in tissues. The availability of these newly developed techniques has becomeessential to the investigation of the pharmacologic regulation of T cells and cytokines bothinvitroandin vivo.

Intravenous immunoglobulin as a potential therapy for refractory urticaria-a review,Casey Watkins; Emma Peiris; Hana Saleh; Guha Krishnaswamy,Urticaria can be a chronic and debilitating affliction and is a relatively common disorderaffecting between 10-20% of the population. Common causes include reactions tomedication; food allergen; physical stimuli and venoms. Urticaria can be acute or chronic.Chronic urticaria lasts for more than 6 weeks and is commonly difficult to treat. The use ofimmunosuppressive agents for this disorder when antihistamines fail can result in significantmorbidity. Recent advances in the pathogenesis; etiology; diagnosis and management ofchronic urticaria have led to new paradigms in treatment of this disorder. Cyclosporine isoften the most effective but has some unique adverse effects that may prevent it from beingused in some patients.

Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans: more than skin deep,Casey E Watkins; Winston B Bokor; Stuart Leicht; George Youngberg; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disease involving the infiltration and accumulationof active mast cells within any organ system. By far; the most common organ affected is theskin. Cutaneous manifestations of mastocytosis; including Urticaria Pigmentosa (UP);cutaneous mastocytoma or telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans (TMEP); may indicatea more serious and potentially life-threatening underlying disease. The presence of eitherUP or TMEP in a patient with anaphylactic symptoms should suggest the likelihood ofsystemic mastocytosis; with the caveat that systemic complications are more likely to occur inpatients with UP. TMEP can usually be identified by the typical morphology; but a skinbiopsy is confirmative.

Bacterial activation of mast cells,David S Chi; Elaine S Walker; Fred E Hossler; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Mast cells often are found in a perivascular location but especially in mucosae;where they may response to various stimuli. They typically associate with immediatehypersensitive responses and are likely to play a critical role in host defense. In this chapter;a common airway pathogen; Moraxella catarrhalis; and a commensal bacterium; Neiserriacinerea; are used to illustrate activation of human mast cells. A human mast cell line (HMC-1) derived from a patient with mast cell leukemia was activated with varying concentrationsof heat-killed bacteria. Active aggregation of bacteria over mast cell surfaces was detectedby scanning electron microscopy. The activation of mast cells was analyzed by nuclearfactor-κB (NF-κB) activation and cytokine production in culture supernatants.

Mast cell histamine and cytokine assays,David S Chi; S Matthew Fitzgerald; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Mast cells are crucial to the development of chronic allergic inflammation and arelikely to play a critical role in host defense. In this chapter methodology for histamine andcytokine assays is provided. Crosslinkage of IgE receptor I (FcεRI) on cord bloodderivedmast cells by myeloma IgE and anti-human IgE is used to induce histamine release.Histamine levels were measured in the culture supernatants using an enzymelinkedimmunosorbent assay. A human mast cell line (HMC-1); derived from a patient with mast cellleukemia; was activated with interleukin (IL)-1β to study cytokine production and geneexpression.

Inhibition of GM-CSF production in fibroblast-monocyte coculture by prednisone and effects of rhGM-CSF on human lung fibroblasts,S Matthew Fitzgerald; David S Chi; Steven A Lee; Kenton Hall; Guha Krishnaswamy,1. ABSTRACT Fibroblasts play a sentinel role in asthmatic disease. They are the mainconstituents of connective tissue and are increased in number in the asthmatic lung. Theyare also capable of secreting a diverse repertoire of cytokines and are able to be activatedby pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell-cell contact. Previously we have reported that normalhuman lung fibroblasts (NHLF) can be activated by monocytes (U937) through cell-cellcontact to produce GM-CSF. Here we show that GM-CSF production from NHLF activated bymonocyte contact is inhibited by prednisone; a synthetic glucocorticoid used in the treatmentof asthma. GM-CSF is an acidic glycoprotein that potentiates development of cells in thegranulocyte and macrophage lineage and is secreted at sites of peripheral inflammation.The receptor for GM-CSF was found on NHLF by flow cytometry and was able to be up …,Front Biosci,2004,6

Appearance of drug-resistant tuberculosis in rural Tennessee.,Jay Mehta; Constantino Diaz; Bhuvana Guha; Leo Harvill; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DRTB) is a growing national health concern in bothurban populations and rural areas and is exacerbated by the growing epidemic of humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Between 1989 and 1992; 7 cases of DRTB (5 withmultidrug-resistance) were diagnosed in an eight-county region of East Tennessee. During1990 and 1991 alone; 5 of 100 patients with tuberculosis had drug-resistant strains (5%). All7 patients with DRTB had 100% resistance to isoniazid; 5 also had resistance tostreptomycin; 2 to rifampin; and 1 to pyrazinamide and ethambutol. All patients were white;US-born; and without evidence of HIV infection. Contact investigation revealed that morecontacts of patients with DRTB (13 of 74; 18%) were infected than were contacts of patientswith drug-sensitive tuberculosis (46 of 290; 16%).

The Hoover's sign of pulmonary disease: molecular basis and clinical relevance,Chambless R Johnston; Narayanaswamy Krishnaswamy; Guha Krishnaswamy,In the 1920's; Hoover described a sign that could be considered a marker of severe airwayobstruction. While readily recognizable at the bedside; it may easily be missed on a cursoryphysical examination. Hoover's sign refers to the inspiratory retraction of the lowerintercostal spaces that occurs with obstructive airway disease. It results from alteration indynamics of diaphragmatic contraction due to hyperinflation; resulting in traction on the ribmargins by the flattened diaphragm. The sign is reported to have a sensitivity of 58% andspecificity of 86% for detection of airway obstruction. Seen in up to 70% of patients withsevere obstruction; this sign is associated with a patient's body mass index; severity ofdyspnea and frequency of exacerbations. Hence the presence of the Hoover's sign mayprovide valuable prognostic information in patients with airway obstruction; and can serve …,*,2008,5
The effect of interferon-gamma; interleukin-4 and immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking of monocytes on allergen-specific T-cell response.,M Kumai; G Krishnaswamy; DG Marsh; SK Huang,Abstract Modulation of the proliferative responses of an allergen-specific human Th2 cellline by cytokine-treated monocytes was examined. The response of this cell line to thespecific allergen; Amb a V (from short ragweed pollen); increased following the addition ofinterleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). However; in the presence of exogenous interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma); there was greater than 40% reduction in the responsiveness of these T cells.The addition of IL-1 beta did not reverse the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma. To determine theprimary target cell type for IFN-gamma; autologous monocytes were pretreated with IL-4; IFN-gamma; or medium alone; and used as antigen-presenting cells (APC). We showed that theresponses of T cells to Amb a V were significantly down-regulated in the presence ofautologous monocytes pretreated with IFN-gamma; but not for monocytes pretreated with …,Immunology,1993,5

The diagnosis and management of chronic rhinosinusitis,Michael Puruckherr; Ryland Byrd; Tom Roy; Guha Krishnaswamy,Sinusitis is a common health problem that lead to frequent visits to primary care physiciansand to ear; nose and throat specialists in the United States and other countries. It contributesto a significant amount of health care expenditure due to direct costs arising from physicianvisits and antibiotics; as well as indirect costs related to missed days at work and a generalloss of productivity due to a decrease in life-quality of those affected (14)(24). The 1996 totaldirect health care expenditures in the USA attributable to sinusitis were estimated with $5.8billion. Of this number about 58.7%(or $3.5 billion) is probably related to chronic sinusitisalone (17).

An obstructive sleep apnea primer: What the practicing allergist needs to know,Sara Pasha; Sandhya Kumar; Arjun B Chatterjee; Guha Krishnaswamy,Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition that affects a large segment of thegeneral population and is considered an underdiagnosed and undersuspected disorder. Anestimated 85% of cases of sleep apnea remain undiagnosed. 2 The exact figures regardingits prevalence vary in different studies because of the use of a variety of indexes anddefinitions in making the diagnosis. Its prevalence in North America is estimated to be 14%in males and 5% in females when OSA is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 orhigher as measured on by polysomnography (PSG) and is associated with excessivedaytime sleepiness. This definition is consistent with the Medicare criteria for the diagnosisof OSA (https://www. cms. gov/medicare-coverage-database/).

Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis,Ariana Eginli; Kena Shah; Casey Watkins; Guha Krishnaswamy,Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN or Lyell disease) arerare diseases that cause acute destruction of the epithelium of the skin and mucousmembrane by a violent immune response. SJS; TEN; and SJS-TEN overlap are consideredvariants in a spectrum of disease severity. SJS involves epidermal detachment of less than10% of total body surface area; TEN involves epidermal detachment of more than 30% oftotal body surface area; and SJS-TEN overlap involves epidermal detachment of 10% to29% of total body surface area. The high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with TENmakes early diagnosis and treatment essential. 1 Medications are the most commonlyreported cause of SJS and TEN.

Aspiration-induced pulmonary syndromes,Kena Shah; Juan Guarderas; Guha Krishnaswamy,Aspiration of foreign material into the lungs is not uncommon and has been described evenin healthy individuals. 1 However; in many clinical pulmonary syndromes; aspiration as animportant triggering event remains unsuspected and undiagnosed. The purpose of thisreview is to present the various facets of aspirationrelated lung disease and discuss thediagnosis and management of these conditions. Aspiration-related pulmonary and airwaydisease can result in a plethora of conditions. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) isone of the more common causes of aspiration and can result in airway and lung disease (Fig1 and Fig 2). Many patients with GERD may not have erosions on endoscopy and havebeen classified as having nonerosive reflux disease. Some cases of reflux may be related tononacid material; such as pepsin or pancreaticobiliary secretions. Aspiration-related lung …,Annals of Allergy; Asthma & Immunology,2016,1
Empty nose syndrome and atrophic rhinitis,Kena Shah; Juan Guarderas; Guha Krishnaswamy,Nasal congestion; nasal obstruction; and sensations of dyspnea are concerns commonlypresenting to the practicing allergist. Although in many cases these represent rhinitis(allergic or vasomotor); several other disorders need to be considered. Among thesedisorders are atrophic rhinitis and the empty nose syndrome (ENS). The term ENS was firstused by Eugene Kern and Monika Stenkvist at the Mayo Clinic in 1994. 1 ENS as is currentlyused refers to a disorder associated with symptoms that arise from iatrogenic nasal tissueloss and often present radiologically with a paucity of normal nasal anatomical structures(Fig 1 A and B). 1 The condition develops months to years in a small subset of patientsundergoing turbinate resection and results from progressive nasal tissue atrophy. 2Similarities exist between ENS and the disease referred to as atrophic rhinitis; and the …,Annals of Allergy; Asthma & Immunology,2016,1

The inflammation paradigm and coronary artery disease: what Celsus; Virchow and gene knock outs have taught us,Guha Krishnaswamy,Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout theworld. The clinical manifestations include coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction;cerebrovascular disease; renovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. Initiallyconsidered a bland occlusive disease mediated to a great extent by lipids; atherosclerosiscan now be considered an inflammatory disease; in its own right. This has led to a paradigmshift in disease management. We have come a long way since the time of Celsus; Galen;Virchow; Rokitansky and others when the components of the inflammatory cascade werefirst described.

Editorial [Hot topic: The Inflammation Paradigm in Cardiovascular Disease (Guest Editor: Guha Krishnaswamy)],Guha Krishnaswamy,This special issue contains a clustering of articles pertaining to the inflammatory aspects ofcardiovascular disease. Over the last several decades; various aspects of cardiac pathologyhave demonstrated an inflammatory basis. This is especially true of atherosclerotic heartdisease; where our understanding has evolved from a bland role for lipids to a veryprofoundly inflammatory state characterized by expression of various inflammatory genes;transcription factors and biochemical mediators. Endothelial dysfunction and inflammatorypathology are seen in such diverse states as diabetic cardiovascular disease and themetabolic syndrome to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. In this series of manuscripts; Dr.Negi and Anand discuss the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and the role of riskfactors in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.

The challenge of improving the health care literacy of the asthma community,Douglas E Masini; Guha Krishnaswamy,Only recently has the inflammatory basis of asthma been appreciated and communicated tothe medical community at large. This has occurred largely as the result of published asthma-management guidelines. 1 Asthma can be considered a disease that results from lack ofpatient and caregiver education. The patient and family need to be a part of a larger strategicpartnership; the foundation of which is education on every aspect of asthma management:understanding inflammation; triggers; and comorbidity factors; effective use of inhalers andmedications; and exacerbation management. Hopefully; this education translates into lessemergency care and better quality of life; both for patient and family. Asthma education2 andmanagement3 were recently addressed in RESPIRATORY CARE.,*,2008,1
A host of factors can lead to worsening hypoxemia--Recognizing the impact of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with asthma,Guha Krishnaswamy,ABSTRACT: The coexistence of asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a givenpatient presents a number of diagnostic and treatment challenges. Although the relationshipbetween these 2 diseases is complex; it is clear that risk factors such as obesity;rhinosinusitis; and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can complicate both asthmaand OSA. In the evaluation of a patient with poorly controlled asthma; it is important toconsider the possibility of OSA. The most obvious clues are daytime sleepiness and snoring;but the definitive diagnosis is made by polysomnography. Management of OSA may includeweight loss and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Surgical intervention; such asuvulopalatopharyngoplasty; may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP.Management may include specific therapies directed at GERD or upper airway disease …,Journal of Respiratory Diseases,2005,1

In the patients described; the presence of dust mite allergy andeosinophilia demonstrates a predominant Th2-response. Thickened bronchi on imagingsuggests airway remodeling; potentially causing cough receptor activation. Both patientshad not responded to optimal management.

Our patientdemonstrated Raynaud's phenomena; myositis and interstitial pneumonitis; all consideredtypical criteria for the disease. However; the role of dust allergy and eosinophilia is unclear.The disease may be complicated by respiratory failure and ultimately require lungtransplantation. While glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy are used in reportedcases; recent studies suggest a role for B cell depletion with rituximab in more severelyafflicted patients who are anti-PL7 antibody positive. Such patients demonstrate someimprovement in lung function.

Resistance training and aerobic exercise alters immune function (87.25),Uday Kumaraguru; Subhadra Nandakumar; David Chi; Michael Stone; Guha Krishnaswamy,Exercise affects various components of the immune system that could be clinically beneficialor deleterious. Accordingly; moderate exercise stimulates the immune system; while intenseexercise suppresses certain immune cell activities. Some of the immune-regulationobserved may be due to the regulatory T cells. This could also explain the differencebetween moderate and strenuous exercisers and the probable reason for lower incidence ofautoimmunity in active individuals. Intense exercisers (Trained-regular) and Moderateexercisers (untrained-occasional) were recruited as volunteers from of our universitycommunity after IRB approval. Blood samples were collected. PBMCs were used for immunecell profile analysis and the plasma was used for cytokine estimation.

The ‘split’brain,Smita Negi; Aashish Anand; Guha Krishnaswamy,Discussion Agenesis of corpus callosum is a rare congenital absence of the midline brainstructure that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. Its incidence ranges from 0.3% to0.7% in the general population to about 2.3% in those with developmental defects. 1; 4Corpus callosum usually develops at about 12th week of gestation. Prenatal infections;genetic disorders; and traumatic or metabolic insults to the fetal brain have all beenimplicated in its development. 2; 3 It may occur sporadically or as a part of around 200different syndromes. 1,Clinical Correspondence,2008,*

Differential effects of cigarette smoke extract on cytokine production from IL-1beta-activated mast cells,David S Chi; Ta-Chang Lin; Kenton Hall; Zong Dao Wu; Jonathan Moorman; Guha Krishnaswamy,Abstract Human mast cells are multifunctional cells capable of a wide variety of inflammatoryresponses and associated with allergy; asthma; and atherosclerosis. Our previous studieshave shown that IL-1β activates human mast cells to produce selected inflammatorycytokines. We examined effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on the production ofinflammatory cytokines from IL-1β-activated human mast cells. Mainstream (Ms) andSidestream (Ss) cigarette smoke were collected onto fiber filters and extracted in RPMI-1640medium. Two ml of HMC-1 at 1× 10 6 cells/mL were cultured with Ms and Ss CSE at variousconcentrations in the presence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 24 hrs. The supernatantswere harvested and assayed for IL-6; IL-8; and MCP-1 by ELISA.

Patients with documented CAD and high CRP levels should befallowed closely; and their risk factors should be managed aggressively. Currently; there isno consensus abot the role of CRP levels in monitoring CAD. Formal guidelines about theuse of CRP as an independent risk factor and in the day-to-day management of CAD are notyet avaiable despite clear evidence of its usefulness in association with other tools;including the stress test.,SENDROM,2004,*

Preferential Uptake of Gamma Tocopherol by Mast Cells. Does This Uptake Affect Mast Cell Cytokine Production?.,Omar S Aljitawi; Mathew Fitzgerald; Min Qui; Koyamangalath Krishnan; William L Stone; Guha Krishnaswamy,Vitamin E; the main lipid soluble antioxidant; exists in eight different forms; of which α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol are the two major forms. Previous experiments showed vitaminE uptake by macrophages that contribute to inflammation and immunity. On the other hand;vitamin E has structural similarity to the thiazolidinedione; troglitazone; a peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist. In previous experiments we found thattroglitazone (TGZ); a PPAR gamma agonist; had a negative effect on mast cell cytokineproduction. We therefore wondered whether vitamin E enters human mast cells; and if so;does this modulate mast cell cytokine production? We choose (interleukin) IL-6 for its pro-inflammatory properties and because it's known to be produced by mast cells in response tostimulants used in the experiment. In this study we try to answer these two questions …,*,2004,*

Journal of occupational medicine and toxicology (London; England) Volume: 1 ISSN: 1745-6673 ISO Abbreviation:- Publication Date: 2006,Semaan G Kosseifi; Bhuvana Guha; Dima N Nassour; David S Chi; Guha Krishnaswamy,Background Dapsone has been used for many indications because of its antibiotic and anti-inflammatory effects [1]. Not only has it been the drug of choice for the treatment of leprosy(Hansen's disease) since the middle of the 20 th century; but it has also been used for thetreatment of brown recluse spider bite [1; 2]; dermatitis herpetiformis; vesicobullousdermatoses; cutaneous vasculitis; polyarteritis nodosa; nodulocystic acne; cutaneousmycetoma and multiples other dermatologic indications all of which may be seen asmanifestations in certain occupational diseases [1]. Since the advent of the era of theAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS); dapsone has been increasingly utilized inthe chemoprophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii infection in combination with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. This has led to increasing incidence of dapsone-related complications …,Detail:,*,*
Clinical and molecular allergy: CMA Volume: 6 ISSN: 1476-7961 ISO Abbreviation: Clin Mol Allergy Publication Date: 2008,Christopher Wt Miller; Narayanaswamy Krishnaswamy; Chambless Johnston; Guha Krishnaswamy,Atopic diseases and asthma are increasing at a remarkable rate on a global scale. It is nowwell recognized that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Theinflammatory process in many patients is driven by an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependentprocess. Mast cell activation and release of mediators; in response to allergen and IgE;results in a cascade response; culminating in B lymphocyte; T lymphocyte; eosinophil;fibroblast; smooth muscle cell and endothelial activation. This complex cellular interaction;release of cytokines; chemokines and growth factors and inflammatory remodeling of theairways leads to chronic asthma. A subset of patients develops severe airway disease whichcan be extremely morbid and even fatal. While many treatments are available for asthma; itis still a chronic and incurable disease; characterized by exacerbation; hospitalizations …,Detail:,*,*
