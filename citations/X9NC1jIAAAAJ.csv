Enhanced magnetic and dielectric properties of Eu and Co co-doped BiFeO3 nanoparticles,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Kajari Das; Babusona Sarkar; Sirshendu Ghosh; SK De; Godhuli Sinha; J Lahtinen,Bi1− x Eu x Fe1− y Co y O3 (x= 0; 0.01; y= 0; 0.01) nanoparticles; having an average size of13 nm; were prepared by a simple sol gel route. Strong electronegativity of Eu3+ andsmaller oxidation-reduction potential of Co3+/Co2+ (0.55 eV) than Fe3+/Fe2+ (1.3 eV)increase the concentration of Fe3+ ions with doping. Distinct magnetic hysteresis andcomplete saturation of magnetisation indicate the presence of ferromagnetic phase. Thesuccessful co-doping of Eu and Co into BiFeO3 (BFO) lattice dramatically enhances thesaturation magnetization (M s) and coercivity (H c) by about 20 times than that of pureBiFeO3. A large value of dielectric constant of about 650; low loss (< 0.001); and smallleakage current density (1.79× 10− 8 A/cm2) are observed for the co-doped sample.,Applied Physics Letters,2012,115
Magnetic and dielectric properties of Eu-doped BiFeO3 nanoparticles by acetic acid-assisted sol-gel method,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Kajari Das; Babusona Sarkar; SK De,The BiFeO3 nanoparticles; having an average size of 13 nm; were synthesized by a simplesol-gel method. The samples possess single phase up to 2% Eu doping at the Bi site. Theuncompensated spin moments on the surface and the modification of cycloidal spin structuredue to the small size (13 nm) result in a ferromagnetic phase of the BiFeO3 nanoparticles.The successful doping of magnetically active Eu 3+ ions in BiFeO3 nanoparticles improvesthe ferromagnetic property. The similar dependency of saturation magnetization; coercivefield; and dielectric constant on Eu doping concentration reveals that a correlation betweenmagnetic and dielectric properties exists in Eu-doped BiFeO3 nanoparticles.,Journal of Applied Physics,2011,43
Effect of oleic acid ligand on photophysical; photoconductive and magnetic properties of monodisperse SnO 2 quantum dots,Sirshendu Ghosh; Kajari Das; Kaushik Chakrabarti; SK De,Oleic acid capped monodisperse SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) of size 2.7 nm weresynthesized by thermal decomposition and oxidation of SnII (oleate) complex in high boilingnonpolar solvent octadecene using oleic acid as a capping agent and N-methylmorpholineN-oxide as an oxidizing agent. FTIR; DSC and TGA were employed to understand thegrowth of the oleic acid capped SnO2 QDs through the decomposition of metal fatty acidcomplex. The surface defect-related luminescence properties of the QDs were demonstratedusing steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. The oleic acid capping on the QDsurface modifies the electronic structure of SnO2 and generates blue emission. Moreoverthe surface capping on the QDs diminishes the photocatalytic activity of bare SnO2 QDs dueto absence of surface oxygen and adsorbed hydroxyl group on the surface of the capped …,Dalton Transactions,2013,22
Magnetic properties of mixed spinel BaTiO3-NiFe2O4 composites,Babusona Sarkar; Biswajit Dalal; Vishal Dev Ashok; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Amitava Mitra; SK De,Solid solution of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) and barium titanate (BaTiO3);(100-x) BaTiO3–(x)NiFe2O4 has been prepared by solid state reaction. Compressive strain is developed inNiFe2O4 due to mutual structural interaction across the interface of NiFe2O4 and BaTiO3phases. Quantitative analysis of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photo electron spectrum suggestmixed spinel structure of NiFe2O4. A systematic study of composition dependence ofcomposite indicates BaTiO3 causes a random distribution of Fe and Ni cations amongoctahedral and tetrahedral sites during non-equilibrium growth of NiFe2O4. The degree ofinversion decreases monotonically from 0.97 to 0.75 with increase of BaTiO3 content.Temperature dependence of magnetization has been analyzed by four sublattice model todescribe complex magnetic exchange interactions in mixed spinel phase.

Template free synthesis of SnO 2 nanoflower arrays on Sn foil,Sirshendu Ghosh; Kajari Das; Kaushik Chakrabarti; SK De,The well aligned poppy-flower-like SnO2 nanoflower array on Sn-foil was successfullyprepared by a simple solvothermal method without using any template or catalyst. Themixed solvent of aqueous sodium hydroxide and hydrazine hydrate plays a significant rolefor obtaining the crystalline pure SnO2 nanoflower array. Each petal of the nanoflowerconsists of the (110) plane of SnO2. The growth of the SnO2 nanoflowers has beendescribed by the formation of layered Sn-hydrazine complexes. The surface defects and theoxygen vacancies of the SnO2 hierarchical nanoflowers are identified by Raman andelectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and are analyzed in detail by steadystate and time resolved photoluminescence spectra.,CrystEngComm,2012,19
Enhanced magnetic and dielectric behavior in Co doped BiFeO 3 nanoparticles,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Babusona Sarkar; Vishal Dev Ashok; Sheli Sinha Chaudhuri; SK De,Abstract Magnetic and dielectric properties of Co doped BiFeO 3 (BFO) nanoparticles (13nm) have been investigated. The dopant Co 2+ converts spherical morphology to cubicnanostructures. The significant changes in temperature dependence of magnetization maybe due to magnetic disorder phase induced by divalent Co. The substitution of Fe by Codisrupts cycloidal spin structure of BFO and improves the ferromagnetic property.Enhancement of the saturation magnetization and coercivity by about 10 times in dopedBFO are due to changes in morphology. High dielectric constant of about 670 and low lossat room temperature show Co doped BFO as promising material for multifunctional devices.,Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials,2015,15
Interfacial magnetism and exchange coupling in BiFeO3–CuO nanocomposite,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Babusona Sarkar; Vishal Dev Ashok; Kajari Das; Sheli Sinha Chaudhuri; SK De,Abstract Ferromagnetic BiFeO 3 nanocrystals of average size 9 nm were used to form acomposite with antiferromagnetic CuO nanosheets; with the composition (x) BiFeO 3/(100−x) CuO; x= 0; 20; 40; 50; 60; 80 and 100. The dispersion of BiFeO 3 nanocrystals into theCuO matrix was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Theferromagnetic ordering as observed in pure BiFeO 3 occurs mainly due to the reduction inthe particle size as compared to the wavelength (62 nm) of the spiral modulated spinstructure of the bulk BiFeO 3. Surface spin disorder of BiFeO 3 nanocrystals gives rise to anexponential behavior of magnetization with temperature. Strong magnetic exchangecoupling between the BiFeO 3 nanocrystal and the CuO matrix induces an interfacialsuperparamagnetic phase with a blocking temperature of about 80 K.

Exchange bias effect in BiFeO3-NiO nanocomposite,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Babusona Sarkar; Vishal Dev Ashok; Kajari Das; Sheli Sinha Chaudhuri; Amitava Mitra; SK De,Ferromagnetic BiFeO3 nanocrystals of average size 11 nm were used to formnanocomposites (x) BiFeO3/(100− x) NiO; x= 0; 20; 40; 50; 60; 80; and 100 by simplesolvothermal process. The ferromagnetic BiFeO3 nanocrystals embedded inantiferromagnetic NiO nanostructures were confirmed from X-ray diffraction andtransmission electron microscope studies. The modification of cycloidal spin structure of bulkBiFeO3 owing to reduction in particle size compared to its spin spiral wavelength (62 nm)results in ferromagnetic ordering in pure BiFeO3 nanocrystals. High Neel temperature (TN)of NiO leads to significant exchange bias effect across the BiFeO3/NiO interface at roomtemperature. A maximum exchange bias field of 123.5 Oe at 300 K for x= 50 after fieldcooling at 7 kOe has been observed. The exchange bias coupling causes an …,Journal of Applied Physics,2014,11
Optical and ferroelectric properties of ruthenium-doped BaTiO3 nanocubes,Babusona Sarkar; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Kajari Das; SK De,Abstract Structural; optical; dielectric and ferroelectric properties of Ru-doped BaTi 1− x Ru xO 3 (x= 0.01; 0.03; 0.05; 0.07; 0.10) nanocubes have been investigated. The average size ofnanocube obtained from Rietveld refinement is in the range 35–60 nm. The incorporation ofRu leads to a mixed tetragonal and cubic crystalline phases in doping concentration range 5–7%. Optical band gap changes from 3.2 to 2.74 eV with increase in Ru concentration.Replacement of Ti with Ru quenches band-edge emission and enhances defect emissionintensity. Optical absorption and emission spectra have been interpreted in terms of oxygenvacancy. Ruthenium 4d orbital plays a crucial role to improve dielectric constant anddiminish ferroelectric Curie temperature. The combined effect of Ru dopant and size givesrise to complex variation of Curie temperature.,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2012,10
Tuning the exchange bias in large area Co/CoO nanowire arrays,D Tripathy; AO Adeyeye; K Chakrabarti; N Singh,The exchange bias effect in Co (25 nm)/Co (5 nm)/Cu (2 nm) nanowire arrays has beensystematically investigated. The exchange bias field HE is strongly dependent on theorientation of field cooling relative to the easy axis of the nanowires. We have exploited thecompetition between field cooling induced unidirectional anisotropy and shape anisotropy ofthe nanowires to tune both the direction and magnitude of exchange bias. A strong interplaybetween thermal activation effects and CoO domain size confinement in the nanowires alsoresults in HE for the nanowire arrays being either smaller or larger than the continuous film.,Journal of Applied Physics,2010,8
Highly efficient photocatalytic activity of CuO quantum dot decorated rGO nanocomposites,Shibsankar Dutta; Kajari Das; Kaushik Chakrabarti; D Jana; SK De; Sukanta De,Abstract CuO quantum dots (QD) of size 4.5 nm decorated on a rGO sheet to formnanocomposites with different weight percentages via a simple soft chemical route wasreported here. Tuning of CuO QD absorption towards the visible region from the UV regionin the presence of rGO was also observed. The luminescence of rGO was found to bequenched in rGO–CuO nanocomposites due to charge transfer from the lowest unoccupiedmolecular orbital of the rGO layer to the conduction band of CuO. Systematic and concisestudies of photocatalytic performance towards degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye byCuO QD along with rGO–CuO nanocomposites were presented in this work. Ananocomposite with an equal weight percentage of rGO and CuO degrades almost 99% ofMB under irradiation of visible light for 50 min; showing maximum degradation efficiency.,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2016,5

The effective radius of the ferromagnetic region is smallerthan the actual nanoparticle size; thus confirming the involvement of a large fraction ofsurface spins in the interfacial magnetism. The exchange coupling between the BiFeO 3nanoparticles and the network-like nanostructured NiO leads to an interfacial blockingphase having an average blocking temperature of about 80 K. The temperature dependentsaturation magnetization follows the Bloch law at high (150–300 K) temperature andexponential behaviour in intermediate (25–150 K) and low (5–25 K) temperature regimes.Exchange bias appears below the irreversible temperature of about 300 K; well below the …,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2014,4

The core–shell formation was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction; highresolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopycharacterizations. UV–visible absorption spectrum of the core–shell nanopyramids shows ared shift of the band edge of pure ZnO in the visible region along with broadening of theabsorption spectrum. ZnO@ CIS nanopyramids can be used as an antireflection coating onSilicon solar cell; exhibit lower reflectance and better light trapping ability than the Siliconsolar cell with ZnO nanopyramids. Moreover higher photocurrent is obtained for the n-ZnO/n-CIS core–shell junction due to favorable band bending. The efficiency of the p-Si/n-ZnO …,Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells,2015,1
