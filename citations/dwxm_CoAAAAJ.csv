Principles of distributed database systems,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,This third edition of a classic textbook can be used to teach at the senior undergraduate andgraduate levels. The material concentrates on fundamental theories as well as techniquesand algorithms. The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web; and; more recently; theemergence of cloud computing and streaming data applications; has forced a renewal ofinterest in distributed and parallel data management; while; at the same time; requiring arethinking of some of the traditional techniques. This book covers the breadth and depth ofthis re-emerging field. The coverage consists of two parts. The first part discusses thefundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design;data integration; distributed query processing and optimization; distributed transactionmanagement; and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and …,*,2011,3938
Issues in data stream management,Lukasz Golab; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Traditional databases store sets of relatively static records with no pre-definednotion of time; unless timestamp attributes are explicitly added. While this model adequatelyrepresents commercial catalogues or repositories of personal information; many current andemerging applications require support for on-line analysis of rapidly changing data streams.Limitations of traditional DBMSs in supporting streaming applications have beenrecognized; prompting research to augment existing technologies and build new systems tomanage streaming data. The purpose of this paper is to review recent work in data streammanagement systems; with an emphasis on application requirements; data models;continuous query languages; and query evaluation.,ACM Sigmod Record,2003,1199
Robust and fast similarity search for moving object trajectories,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract An important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectoriesis the definition of a distance function. The existing distance functions are usually sensitive tonoise; shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures; errors indetection techniques; disturbance signals; and different sampling rates. Cleaning data toeliminate these is not always possible. In this paper; we introduce a novel distance function;Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) which is robust against these data imperfections.Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions; such as Euclideandistance; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW); Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP); andLongest Common Subsequences (LCSS); indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclideandistance; DTW and ERP; and it is on average 50% more accurate than LCSS.

Encyclopedia of database systems,Ling Liu; M Tamer Özsu,We are in an information era where generating and storing large amounts of data arecommonplace. A growing number of organizations routinely handle terabytes and exabytesof data; and individual digital data collections easily reach multiple gigabytes. Along with theincreases in volume; the modality of digitized data that requires efficient management andthe access modes to these data have become more varied. It is increasingly common forbusiness and personal data collections to include images; video; voice; and unstructuredtext; the retrieval of these data comprises various forms; including structured queries;keyword search; and visual access. Data have become a highly valued asset forgovernments; industries and individuals; and the management of these data collectionsremains a critical technical challenge.

K-automorphism: A general framework for privacy preserving network publication,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The growing popularity of social networks has generated interesting datamanagement and data mining problems. An important concern in the release of these datafor study is their privacy; since social networks usually contain personal information. Simplyremoving all identifiable personal information (such as names and social security number)before releasing the data is insufficient. It is easy for an attacker to identify the target byperforming different structural queries. In this paper we propose k-automorphism to protectagainst multiple structural attacks and develop an algorithm (called KM) that ensures k-automorphism. We also discuss an extension of KM to handle" dynamic" releases of thedata. Extensive experiments show that the algorithm performs well in terms of protection itprovides.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,335
-Processing Sliding Window Multi-Joins in Continuous Queries over Data Streams,Lukasz Golab; M Tamer Özsu,This chapter presents and analyzes incremental; multi-way join algorithms for slidingwindows over data streams. Based on a per-unit-time cost model; it develops a join orderingheuristic that finds a good join order without iterating over the entire search space.Experiments with a Java implementation of the operators have shown that various systemparameters such as stream arrival rates; tuple expiration policies; and hash table sizesgreatly affect query processing efficiency. In particular; the optimal tuple expiration frequencydepends on the choice of algorithm and on the sizes of the hash tables—the larger the hashtable; the higher the optimal frequency. In general; hash-based joins performed much betterthan nested loop joins (NLJs) and also allocating more hash buckets to larger windows is apromising strategy.Processing Sliding Window Multi-Joins in Continuous Queries over …,*,2003,335
A comprehensive XQuery to SQL translation using dynamic interval encoding,David DeHaan; David Toman; Mariano P Consens; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The W3C XQuery language recommendation; based on a hierarchical and ordereddocument model; supports a wide variety of constructs and use cases. There is a diversity ofapproaches and strategies for evaluating XQuery expressions; in many cases only dealingwith limited subsets of the language. In this paper we describe an implementation approachthat handles XQuery with arbitrarily-nested FLWR expressions; element constructors andbuilt-in functions (including structural comparisons). Our proposal maps an XQueryexpression to a single equivalent SQL query using a novel dynamic interval encoding of acollection of XML documents as relations; augmented with information tied to the queryevaluation environment. The dynamic interval technique enables (suitably enhanced)relational engines to produce predictably good query plans that do not preclude the use …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,237
Queries and query processing in object-oriented database systems,David D Straube; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Object-oriented database mangement systems (OODBMS) combine the dataabstraction and computational models of object-oriented programming languages with thequery and performance capabilities of database management systems. A concise; formaldata model for OODBMS has not been universally accepted; preventing detailedinvestigation of various system issues such as query processing. We define a data modelthat captures the essence of classification-based object-oriented systems and formalizeconcepts such as object identity; inheritence; and methods. The main topic of the paper isthe presentation of a query processing methodology complete with an object calculus toobject algebra translation are discussed in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion ofequivalence-preserving transformation rules for object algebra expressions.,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),1990,210
Using semantic knowledge of transactions to increase concurrency,Abdel Aziz Farrag; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract When the only information available about transactions is syntactic information;serializability is the main correctness criterion for concurrency control. Serializability requiresthat the execution of each transaction must appear to every other transaction as a singleatomic step (ie; the execution of the transaction cannot be interrupted by other transactions).Many researchers; however; have realized that this requirement is unnecessarily strong formany applications and can significantly increase transaction response time. To overcomethis problem; a new approach for controlling concurrency that exploits the semanticinformation available about transactions to allow controlled nonserializable interleavingshas recently been proposed. This approach is useful when the cost of producing onlyserializable interleavings is unacceptably high. The main drawback of the approach is the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1989,191
A web page prediction model based on click-stream tree representation of user behavior,Şule Gündüz; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Predicting the next request of a user as she visits Web pages has gainedimportance as Web-based activity increases. Markov models and their variations; or modelsbased on sequence mining have been found well suited for this problem. However; higherorder Markov models are extremely complicated due to their large number of states whereaslower order Markov models do not capture the entire behavior of a user in a session. Themodels that are based on sequential pattern mining only consider the frequent sequences inthe data set; making it difficult to predict the next request following a page that is not in thesequential pattern. Furthermore; it is hard to find models for mining two different kinds ofinformation of a user session. We propose a new model that considers both the orderinformation of pages in a session and the time spent on them. We cluster user sessions …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,187
A transaction model for active distributed object systems,Alejandro P Buchmann; M Tamer Özsu; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Frank Manola,Two recent developments in data management are the emergence of database systems withextended functionality Atkinson et al.; 1989; Stonebraker et al.; 1990a]; and the integration ofmultiple; heterogeneous database systems Litwin; 1988; Gupta; 1989; Sheth and Larson;1990]. An even more ambitious goal is the integration of autonomous; heterogeneousdatabase and non-database systems into a distributed computing environment. The DOM(Distributed Object Management) project at GTE Laboratories addresses precisely theseissues. The DOM project has as its goal the development of a distributed; object-orientedenvironment in which new (non-traditional) applications can be developed; and in whichautonomous; heterogeneous systems can be integrated Manola; 1988 and 1989; Manolaand Buchmann; 1990].

Distributed and parallel database systems,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,The maturation of database management system (DBMS) technology has coincided withsignificant developments in distributed computing and parallel processing technologies. Theend result is the emergence of distributed database management systems and paralleldatabase management systems. These systems have started to become the dominant data-management tools for highly data-intensive applications. A distributed database (DDB) is acollection of multiple; logically interrelated databases distributed over a computer network. Adistributed database management system (distributed DBMS) is then defined as thesoftware system that permits the management of the distributed database and makes thedistribution transparent to the users [Ozsu and Valduriez 1991]. There are many possibledistributed DBMS implementation alternatives.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,169
Main-memory hash joins on multi-core CPUs: Tuning to the underlying hardware,Cagri Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,The architectural changes introduced with multi-core CPUs have triggered a redesign ofmain-memory join algorithms. In the last few years; two diverging views have appeared. Oneapproach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the architectural parameters (cachesizes; TLB; and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues that modern hardware isgood enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and; consequently; the carefultailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In this paper we demonstratethrough experimental analysis of different algorithms and architectures that hardware stillmatters. Join algorithms that are hardware conscious perform better than hardware-obliviousapproaches. The analysis and comparisons in the paper show that many of the claimsregarding the behavior of join algorithms that have appeared in literature are due to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,167
gStore: answering SPARQL queries via subgraph matching,Lei Zou; Jinghui Mo; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to the increasing use of RDF data; efficient processing of SPARQL queriesover RDF datasets has become an important issue. However; existing solutions suffer fromtwo limitations: 1) they cannot answer SPARQL queries with wildcards in a scalable manner;and 2) they cannot handle frequent updates in RDF repositories efficiently. Thus; most ofthem have to reprocess the dataset from scratch. In this paper; we propose a graph-basedapproach to store and query RDF data. Rather than mapping RDF triples into a relationaldatabase as most existing methods do; we store RDF data as a large graph. A SPARQLquery is then converted into a corresponding subgraph matching query. In order to speed upquery processing; we develop a novel index; together with some effective pruning rules andefficient search algorithms. Our method can answer exact SPARQL queries and queries …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,167
XBench benchmark and performance testing of XML DBMSs,Benjamin Bin Yao; M Tamer Ozsu; Nitin Khandelwal,XML support is being added to existing database management systems (DBMSs) and nativeXML systems are being developed both in industry and in academia. The individualperformance characteristics of these approaches as well as the relative performance ofvarious systems is an ongoing concern. In this paper we discuss the XBench XMLbenchmark and report on the relative performance of various DBMSs. XBench is a family ofXML benchmarks which recognizes that the XML data that DBMSs manage are quite variedand no one database schema and workload can properly capture this variety. Thus; themembers of this benchmark family have been defined for capturing diverse applicationdomains.,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,163
Distributed data management using MapReduce,Feng Li; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Özsu; Sai Wu,Abstract MapReduce is a framework for processing and managing large-scale datasets in adistributed cluster; which has been used for applications such as generating search indexes;document clustering; access log analysis; and various other forms of data analytics.MapReduce adopts a flexible computation model with a simple interface consisting of mapand reduce functions whose implementations can be customized by application developers.Since its introduction; a substantial amount of research effort has been directed towardmaking it more usable and efficient for supporting database-centric operations. In this article;we aim to provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of proposals and systems thatfocusing fundamentally on the support of distributed data management and processingusing the MapReduce framework.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2014,162
Distance-join: Pattern match query in a large graph database,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The growing popularity of graph databases has generated interesting datamanagement problems; such as subgraph search; shortest-path query; reachabilityverification; and pattern match. Among these; a pattern match query is more flexiblecompared to a subgraph search and more informative compared to a shortest-path orreachability query. In this paper; we address pattern match problems over a large data graphG. Specifically; given a pattern graph (ie; query Q); we want to find all matches (in G) thathave the similar connections as those in Q. In order to reduce the search space significantly;we first transform the vertices into points in a vector space via graph embedding techniques;coverting a pattern match query into a distance-based multi-way join problem over theconverted vector space. We also propose several pruning strategies and a join order …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,162
Multi-core; main-memory joins: Sort vs. hash revisited,Cagri Balkesen; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In this paper we experimentally study the performance of main-memory; parallel;multi-core join algorithms; focusing on sort-merge and (radix-) hash join. The relativeperformance of these two join approaches have been a topic of discussion for a long time.With the advent of modern multi-core architectures; it has been argued that sort-merge join isnow a better choice than radix-hash join. This claim is justified based on the width of SIMDinstructions (sort-merge outperforms radix-hash join once SIMD is sufficiently wide); andNUMA awareness (sort-merge is superior to hash join in NUMA architectures). We conductextensive experiments on the original and optimized versions of these algorithms. Theexperiments show that; contrary to these claims; radix-hash join is still clearly superior; andsort-merge approaches to performance of radix only when very large amounts of data are …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,139
An experimental comparison of pregel-like graph processing systems,Minyang Han; Khuzaima Daudjee; Khaled Ammar; M Tamer Özsu; Xingfang Wang; Tianqi Jin,Abstract The introduction of Google's Pregel generated much interest in the field of large-scale graph data processing; inspiring the development of Pregel-like systems such asApache Giraph; GPS; Mizan; and GraphLab; all of which have appeared in the past twoyears. To gain an understanding of how Pregel-like systems perform; we conduct a study toexperimentally compare Giraph; GPS; Mizan; and GraphLab on equal ground byconsidering graph and algorithm agnostic optimizations and by using several metrics. Thesystems are compared with four different algorithms (PageRank; single source shortest path;weakly connected components; and distributed minimum spanning tree) on up to 128Amazon EC2 machines.

A succinct physical storage scheme for efficient evaluation of path queries in XML,Ning Zhang; Varun Kacholia; M Tamer Ozsu,Path expressions are ubiquitous in XML processing languages. Existing approachesevaluate a path expression by selecting nodes that satisfies the tag-name and valueconstraints and then joining them according to the structural constraints. We propose a novelapproach; next-of-kin (NoK) pattern matching; to speed up the node-selection step; and toreduce the join size significantly in the second step. To efficiently perform NoK patternmatching; we also propose a succinct XML physical storage scheme that is adaptive toupdates and streaming XML as well. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposedstorage scheme and path evaluation algorithm is highly efficient and outperforms the othertested systems in most cases.,Data Engineering; 2004.

In addition; most of these application domainsrequire the management of distributed artifacts. Therefore; next generation OODBMSs arelikely to be distributed systems.

In-network execution of monitoring queries in sensor networks,Xiaoyan Yang; Hock Beng Lim; Tamer M Özsu; Kian Lee Tan,Abstract Sensor networks are widely used in many applications for collecting informationfrom the physical environment. In these applications; it is usually necessary to track therelationships between sensor data readings within a time window to detect events ofinterest. However; it is difficult to detect such events by using the common aggregate orselection queries. We address the problem of processing window self-join in order to detectevents of interest. Self-joins are useful in tracking correlations between different sensorreadings; which can indicate an event of interest. We propose the Two-Phase Self-Join(TPSJ) scheme to efficiently evaluate self-join queries for event detection in sensornetworks. Our TPSJ scheme takes advantage of the properties of the events and carries outdata filtering during in-network processing. We discuss TPSJ execution with one window …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,118
Report on the dagstuhl seminar,Michael Gertz; M Tamer Özsu; Gunter Saake; Kai-Uwe Sattler,Over the past few years; techniques for managing; querying; and integrating data on theWeb have significantly matured. Well-founded and practical approaches to assess or evenguarantee a required degree of quality of the data in these frameworks; however; are stillmissing. This can be contributed to the lack of welldefined data quality metrics andassessment techniques; and the difficulty of handling information about data quality duringdata integration and query processing. Data quality problems arise in many settings; such asthe integration of business data; in Web mining; data dissemination; and in querying theWeb using search engines.

QAGen: generating query-aware test databases,Carsten Binnig; Donald Kossmann; Eric Lo; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Today; a common methodology for testing a database management system (DBMS)is to generate a set of test databases and then execute queries on top of them. However; forDBMS testing; it would be a big advantage if we can control the input and/or the output (eg;the cardinality) of each individual operator of a test query for a particular test case.Unfortunately; current database generators generate databases independent of queries. Asa result; it is hard to guarantee that executing the test query on the generated test databasescan obtain the desired (intermediate) query results that match the test case. In this paper; wepropose a novel way for DBMS testing. Instead of first generating a test database and thenseeing how well it matches a particular test case (or otherwise use a trial-and-errorapproach to generate another test database); we propose to generate a query-aware …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,108

Xseed: Accurate and fast cardinality estimation for xpath queries,Ning Zhang; M Tamer Ozsu; Ashraf Aboulnaga; Ihab F Ilyas,We propose XSEED; a synopsis of path queries for cardinality estimation that is accurate;robust; efficient; and adaptive to memory budgets. XSEED starts from a very small kernel;and then incrementally updates information of the synopsis. With such an incrementalconstruction; a synopsis structure can be dynamically configured to accommodate differentmemory budgets. Cardinality estimation based on XSEED can be performed very efficientlyand accurately. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that evenwith less memory; XSEED could achieve accuracy that is an order of magnitude better thanthat of other synopsis structures. The cardinality estimation time is under 2% of the actualquerying time for a wide range of queries in all test cases.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Diversified stress testing of RDF data management systems,Güneş Aluç; Olaf Hartig; M Tamer Özsu; Khuzaima Daudjee,Abstract The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for conceptuallydescribing data on the Web; and SPARQL is the query language for RDF. As RDF datacontinue to be published across heterogeneous domains and integrated at Web-scale suchas in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud; RDF data management systems are beingexposed to queries that are far more diverse and workloads that are far more varied. The firstcontribution of our work is an in-depth experimental analysis that shows existing SPARQLbenchmarks are not suitable for testing systems for diverse queries and varied workloads.To address these shortcomings; our second contribution is the Waterloo SPARQL DiversityTest Suite (WatDiv) that provides stress testing tools for RDF data management systems.Using WatDiv; we have been able to reveal issues with existing systems that went …,International Semantic Web Conference,2014,103
Efficient core decomposition in massive networks,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Shumo Chu; M Tamer Özsu,The k-core of a graph is the largest subgraph in which every vertex is connected to at least kother vertices within the subgraph. Core decomposition finds the k-core of the graph forevery possible k. Past studies have shown important applications of core decompositionsuch as in the study of the properties of large networks (eg; sustainability; connectivity;centrality; etc.); for solving NP-hard problems efficiently in real networks (eg; maximumclique finding; densest subgraph approximation; etc.); and for large-scale networkfingerprinting and visualization. The k-core is a well accepted concept partly because thereexists a simple and efficient algorithm for core decomposition; by recursively removing thelowest degree vertices and their incident edges. However; this algorithm requires randomaccess to the graph and hence assumes the entire graph can be kept in main memory …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,103

An axiomatic model of dynamic schema evolution in objectbase systems,Randel J Peters; M Tamer Özsu,The axiomatic model is a formal treatment of DSE in OBSs; which distinguishes it from otherapproaches that informally define a number of schema invariants and the rules that enforcethem. An informal approach leads to multiple DSE mechanisms because of the differencesin object models and the choices made by system designers. The lack of a common objectmodel makes comparison of OBSs more difficult. The axiomatic model provides a solutionfor DSE in OBSs by serving as a common; formal underlying foundation for describing DSEof existing systems; which makes comparison of these systems much easier. A design spacefor OBSs based on the inclusion/exclusion of axioms is developed and can be used toclassify; compare; and differentiate the features of OBSs. To test the expressibility of themodel; the DSE of several OBSs are reduced to the axiomatic model and compared.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1997,101

Everything in the system; includingtypes; classes; collections; behaviors; and functions; as well as meta-information; is a first-class object with well-defined behavior. In this way; the model abstracts everything;including traditional structural notions such as instance variables; method implementation;and schema definition; into a uniform semantics of behaviors on objects.

Keyword search in databases,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Lijun Chang,Abstract It has become highly desirable to provide users with flexible ways to query/searchinformation over databases as simple as keyword search like Google search. This booksurveys the recent developments on keyword search over databases; and focuses onfinding structural information among objects in a database using a set of keywords. Suchstructural information to be returned can be either trees or subgraphs representing how theobjects; that contain the required keywords; are interconnected in a relational database or inan XML database. The structural keyword search is completely different from findingdocuments that contain all the user-given keywords. The former focuses on theinterconnected object structures; whereas the latter focuses on the object content. The bookis organized as follows.

Efficient method for maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; M Tamer Özsu; Philip S Yu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Lian Liu,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) has been extensively studied inspatial database literature. In this paper; we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: findan optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs. Such a problem has many real lifeapplications; including the problem of finding a new server point that attracts as manycustomers as possible by proximity. A straightforward approach is to determine the BRNNsfor all possible points that are not feasible since there are a large (or infinite) number ofpossible points. To the best of our knowledge; the fastest known method has exponentialtime complexity on the data size. Based on some interesting properties of the problem; wecome up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap. Extensive experiments areconducted to show that our algorithm is many times faster than the best-known technique.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,90
MOQL: A multimedia object query language,John Z Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron; Vincent Oria,Abstract We describe a general multimedia query language; called MOQL; based onODMG's Object Query Language (OQL). In contrast to previous multimedia query languagesthat are either designed for one particular medium (eg images) or specialized for a particularapplication (eg; medical imaging); MOQL is general in its treatment of multiple media and dierent applications. The language includes constructs to capture the temporal and spatialrelationships in multimedia data as well as functions for query presentation. We illustrate thelanguage features by query examples. The language is implemented for a multimediadatabase built on top of ObjectStore.,Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Multimedia Information Systems,1997,87
Update-pattern-aware modeling and processing of continuous queries,Lukasz Golab; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract A defining characteristic of continuous queries over on-line data streams; possiblybounded by sliding windows; is the potentially infinite and time-evolving nature of theirinputs and outputs. New items continually arrive on the input streams and new results arecontinually produced. Additionally; inputs expire by falling out of range of their slidingwindows and results expire when they cease to satisfy the query. This impacts continuousquery processing in two ways. First; data stream systems allow tables to be queriedalongside data streams; but in terms of query semantics; it is not clear how updates of tablesare different from insertions and deletions caused by the movement of the sliding windows.Second; many interesting queries need to store state; which must be kept up-to-date as timegoes on. Therefore; query processing efficiency depends highly on the amount of …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,83
On indexing sliding windows over online data streams,Lukasz Golab; Shaveen Garg; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract We consider indexing sliding windows in main memory over on-line data streams.Our proposed data structures and query semantics are based on a division of the slidingwindow into sub-windows. By classifying windowed operators according to their method ofexecution; we motivate the need for two types of windowed indices: those which provide alist of attribute values and their counts for answering set-valued queries; and those whichprovide direct access to tuples for answering attribute-valued queries. We propose andevaluate indices for both of these cases and show that our techniques are more efficientthan executing windowed queries without an index.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,79
On type systems for object-oriented database programming languages,Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract The concept of an object-oriented database programming language (OODBPL) isappealing because it has the potential of combining the advantages of object orientationand database programming to yield a powerful and universal programming languagedesign. A uniform and consistent combination of object orientation and databaseprogramming; however; is not straightforward. Since one of the main components of anobject-oriented programming language is its type system; one of the first problems thatarises during an OODBPL design is related to the development of a uniform; consistent; andtheoretically sound type system that is sufficiently expressive to satisfy the combined needsof object orientation and database programming.

Data stream management,Lukasz Golab; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Many applications process high volumes of streaming data; among them Internettraffic analysis; financial tickers; and transaction log mining.

In this lecture; we give an overview of recent research instream processing; ranging from answering simple queries on high-speed streams toloading real-time data feeds into a streaming warehouse for off-line analysis. We will discusstwo types of systems for end-to-end stream processing: Data Stream Management Systems(DSMSs) and Streaming Data Warehouses (SDWs). A traditional database managementsystem typically processes a stream of ad-hoc queries over relatively static data. In contrast;a DSMS evaluates static (long-running) queries on streaming data; making a single pass …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2010,75
Multiple materialized view selection for XPath query rewriting,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; M Tamer Ozsu; Byron Choi; Kam-Fai Wong,We study the problem of answering XPATH queries using multiple materialized views.Despite the efforts on answering queries using single materialized view; answering queriesusing multiple views remains relatively new. We address two important aspects of thisproblem: multiple-view selection and equivalent multiple-view rewriting. With regards to thefirst problem; we propose an NFA-based approach (called VFILTER) to filter views thatcannot be used to answer a given query. We then present the criterion for multipleview/query answerability. Based on the output of VFILTER; we further propose a heuristicmethod to identify a minimal view set that can answer a given query. For the problem ofmultiple-view rewriting; we first refine the materialized fragments of each selected view (likepushing selection); we then join the refined fragments utilizing an encoding scheme …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Mixed type audio classification with support vector machine,Lei Chen; Sule Gunduz; M Tamer Ozsu,Content-based classification of audio data is an important problem for various applicationssuch as overall analysis of audio-visual streams; boundary detection of video story segment;extraction of speech segments from video; and content-based video retrieval. Though theclassification of audio into single type such as music; speech; environmental sound andsilence is well studied; classification of mixed type audio data; such as clips having speechwith music as background; is still considered a difficult problem. In this paper; we present amixed type audio classification system based on support vector machine (SVM). In order tocapture characteristics of different types of audio data; besides selecting audio features; wealso design four different representation formats for each feature. Our SVM-based audioclassifier can classify audio data into five types: music; speech; environment sound …,Multimedia and Expo; 2006 IEEE International Conference on,2006,66
An extendible hash for multi-precision similarity querying of image databases,Shu Lin; M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria; Raymond Ng,Abstract We propose multi-precision similarity matching where the image is divided into anumber of subblocks; each with its associated color histogram. We present experimentalresults showing that the spatial distribution information recorded by multiprecision colorhistograms helps to make similarity matching more precise. We also show that sub-imagequeries are much better supported with multi-precision color histograms. To minimize theoverhead; we employ a filtering scheme based on the 3-dimensional average color vectors.We provide a formal result proving that filtering with multi-precision color histograms iscomplete. Finally; we develop a novel extendible hashing structure for indexing the averagecolor vectors. We give experimental results showing that the proposed structure significantlyoutperforms the SR-tree.,VLDB,2001,66
Temporal granularity: Completing the puzzle,Iqbal A Goralwalla; Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron; Carlo Combi,Abstract Granularity is an integral feature of both anchored (eg; 25 October 1995; July 1996)and unanchored (eg; 3 minutes; 6 hours 20 minutes; 5 days) temporal data. In supportingtemporal data that is specified in different granularities; numerous approaches have beenproposed to deal with the issues of converting temporal data from one granularity to another.The emphasis; however; has only been on granularity conversions with respect to anchoredtemporal data. In this paper we provide a novel approach to the treatment of granularity intemporal data. A granularity is modeled as a special kind of unanchored temporal primitivethat can be used as a unit of time. That is; a granularity is modeled as a unit unanchoredtemporal primitive. We show how unanchored temporal data is represented; giveprocedures for converting the data to a given granularity; provide canonical forms for the …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2001,65
Modeling of video spatial relationships in an object database management system,John Z Li; Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,A key aspect in video modeling is spatial relationships. We propose a spatial representationfor specifying the spatial semantics of video data. Based on such a representation; a set ofspatial relationships for salient objects is defined to support qualitative and quantitativespatial properties. The model captures both topological and directional spatial relationships.We present a novel way of incorporating this model into a video model; and integrating theabstract video model into an object database management system which has richmultimedia temporal operations. The integrated model is further enhanced by a spatialinference engine. The powerful expressiveness of our video model is validated by somequery examples.,Multimedia Database Management Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of International Workshop on,1996,65
Query optimization in XML structured-document databases,Dunren Che; Karl Aberer; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract While the information published in the form of XML-compliant documents keeps fastmounting up; efficient and effective query processing and optimization for XML have nowbecome more important than ever. This article reports our recent advances in XMLstructured-document query optimization. In this article; we elaborate on a novel approachand the techniques developed for XML query optimization. Our approach performs heuristic-based algebraic transformations on XPath queries; represented as PAT algebraicexpressions; to achieve query optimization. This article first presents a comprehensive set ofgeneral equivalences with regard to XML documents and XML queries. Based on theseequivalences; we developed a large set of deterministic algebraic transformation rules forXML query optimization.

Extending DBMSs with satellite databases,Christian Plattner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In this paper; we propose an extensible architecture for database engines wheresatellite databases are used to scale out and implement additional functionality for acentralized database engine. The architecture uses a middleware layer that offers consistentviews and a single system image over a cluster of machines with database engines. One ofthese engines acts as a master copy while the others are read-only snapshots which we callsatellites. The satellites are lightweight DBMSs used for scalability and to providefunctionality difficult or expensive to implement in the main engine. Our approach alsosupports the dynamic creation of satellites to be able to autonomously adapt to varyingloads. The paper presents the architecture; discusses the research problems it raises; andvalidates its feasibility with extensive experimental results.,The VLDB Journal,2008,62
Symbolic representation and retrieval of moving object trajectories,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract Searching moving object trajectories of video databases has been applied to manyfields; such as video data analysis; content-based video retrieval; video scene classification.In this paper; we propose a novel representation of trajectories; called< i> movement patternstrings</i>; which convert the trajectories into symbolic representations. Movement patternstrings encode both the movement direction and the movement distance information of thetrajectories. The distances that are computed in a symbolic space are lower bounds of thedistances of original trajectory data; which guarantees that no false dismissals will beintroduced using movement pattern strings to retrieve trajectories. In order to improve theretrieval efficiency; we define a< i> modified frequency distance</i> for frequency vectorsthat are obtained from movement pattern strings to reduce the dimensionality and the …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGMM international workshop on Multimedia information retrieval,2004,62
Creating competitive products,Qian Wan; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ihab F Ilyas; M Tamer Özsu; Yu Peng,Abstract The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized inmulti-criteria decision making applications. Most previous works study how to helpcustomers find a set of" best" possible products from a pool of given products. In this paper;we identify an interesting problem; creating competitive products; which has not beenstudied before. Given a set of products in the existing market; we want to study how to createa set of" best" possible products such that the newly created products are not dominated bythe products in the existing market. We refer such products as competitive products. Astraightforward solution is to generate a set of all possible products and check fordominance relationships. However; the whole set is quite large. In this paper; we propose asolution to generate a subset of this set effectively. An extensive performance study using …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,58
Conflict tolerant queries in AURORA,Ling Ling Yan; M Tamer Ozsu,Conflict tolerant queries are a new way of dealing with instance level conflicts in dataintegrated from multiple sources. In contrast to the traditional approach of resolving suchconflicts during schema integration using aggregation functions; we establish a query modeland processing techniques to tolerate these conflicts at query time to a degree specified bythe users. Resolutions are only performed to produce conflict-free results. Currently wesupport three levels of conflict tolerance: HighConfidence; RandomEvidence; andPossibleAtAll and allow user-defined functions to be used for conflict resolution. Theapproach reduces the overhead of conflict detection and resolution and lends itself to newquery optimization techniques. Fundamentally; our approach allows users to handle conflictat a coarse granularity to achieve better query performance when conflict resolution …,Cooperative Information Systems; 1999. CoopIS'99.

An object-oriented framework for temporal data models,Iqbal A Goralwalla; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract Most of the database research on modeling time has concentrated on the definitionof a particular temporal model and its incorporation into a (relational or object) databasemanagement system. This has resulted in quite a large number of different temporal models;each providing a specific set of temporal features. Therefore; the first step of this work is adesign space for temporal models which accommodates multiple notions of time; therebyclassifying design alternatives for temporal models. The design space is then representedby exploiting object-oriented features to model the different aspects of time. An object-oriented approach allows us to capture the complex semantics of time by representing it as abasic entity. Furthermore; the typing and inheritance mechanisms of object-oriented systemsallow the various notions of time to be reflected in a single framework. The framework can …,*,1998,56
Data stream management issues–a survey,Lukasz Golab; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Traditional databases store sets of relatively static records with no pre-definednotion of time; unless timestamp attributes are explicitly added. While this model adequatelyrepresents commercial catalogues or repositories of personal information; many current andemerging applications require support for on-line analysis of rapidly changing data streams.Limitations of traditional DBMSs in supporting streaming applications have beenrecognized; prompting research to augment existing technologies and build new systems tomanage streaming data. The purpose of this paper is to review recent work in data streammanagement systems; with an emphasis on data models; continuous query languages; andquery evaluation and optimization techniques. We also give examples of streaming queriesin various applications and review related work in modeling lists and sequences.,*,2003,55
gStore: a graph-based SPARQL query engine,Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu; Lei Chen; Xuchuan Shen; Ruizhe Huang; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract We address efficient processing of SPARQL queries over RDF datasets. Theproposed techniques; incorporated into the gStore system; handle; in a uniform and scalablemanner; SPARQL queries with wildcards and aggregate operators over dynamic RDFdatasets. Our approach is graph based. We store RDF data as a large graph and alsorepresent a SPARQL query as a query graph. Thus; the query answering problem isconverted into a subgraph matching problem. To achieve efficient and scalable queryprocessing; we develop an index; together with effective pruning rules and efficient searchalgorithms. We propose techniques that use this infrastructure to answer aggregationqueries. We also propose an effective maintenance algorithm to handle online updates overRDF repositories. Extensive experiments confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our …,The VLDB journal,2014,53
Fix: Feature-based indexing technique for xml documents,Ning Zhang; M Tamer Özsu; Ihab F Ilyas; Ashraf Aboulnaga,Abstract Indexing large XML databases is crucial for efficient evaluation of XML twig queries.In this paper; we propose a feature-based indexing technique; called FIX; based on spectralgraph theory. The basic idea is that for each twig pattern in a collection of XML documents;we calculate a vector of features based on its structural properties. These features are usedas keys for the patterns and stored in a B+ tree. Given an XPath query; its feature vector isfirst calculated and looked up in the index. Then a further refinement phase is performed tofetch the final results. We experimentally study the indexing technique over both syntheticand real data sets. Our experiments show that FIX provides great pruning power and couldgain an order of magnitude performance improvement for many XPath queries over existingevaluation techniques.,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,53

Modeling video temporal relationships in an object database management system,John Z Li; Iqbal A Goralwalla; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,One of the key aspects of videos is the temporal relationship between video frames. In thispaper we propose a tree-based model for specifying the temporal semantics of video data.We present a unique way of integrating our video model into an object databasemanagement system which has rich multimedia temporal operations. We further show howtemporal histories are used to model video data; explore the video object base using object-oriented techniques. Such a seamless integration gives a uniform interface to end users.The integrated video object base management systems supports a broad range of temporalqueries.,Multimedia Computing and Networking 1997,1997,53
Query Processing in Object-Oriented Database Systems.,M Tamer Özsu; José A Blakeley,Abstract One of the basic functionalities of database management systems (DBMSs) is to beable to process declarative user queries. The first generation of object-oriented DBMSs didnot provide declarative query capabilities. However; the last decade has seen significantresearch in defining query models (including calculi; algebra and user languages) and intechniques for processing and optimizing them. Many of the current commercial systemsprovide at least rudimentary query capabilities. In this chapter we discuss the techniquesthat have been developed for processing object-oriented queries. Our particular emphasis ison extensible query processing architectures and techniques. The other chapters in thisbook on query languages and optimization techniques complement this chapter.,*,1995,53
Preventive multi-master replication in a cluster of autonomous databases,Esther Pacitti; M Tamer Özsu; Cédric Coulon,Abstract We consider the use of a cluster of PC servers for Application Service Providerswhere applications and databases must remain autonomous. We use data replication toimprove data availability and query load balancing (and thus performance). However;replicating databases at several nodes can create consistency problems; which need to bemanaged through special protocols. In this paper; we present a lazy preventive datareplication solution that assures strong consistency without the constraints of eagerreplication. We first present a peer-to peer cluster architecture in which we identify thereplication manager. Cluster nodes can support autonomous; heterogeneous databasesthat are considered as black boxes.

Modeling images for content-based queries: The DISIMA approach,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; Ling Liu; Xiaobo Li; John Z Li; Youping Niu; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract The DISIMA project aims at building a complete image database system enablingcontent-based querying. The model; the architecture and a query language have beendefined. The prototype is being implemented on top of the ObjectStore DBMS. DISIMAproposes a model for both image and spatial applications. The DISIMA model allows theuser to assign different semantics to an image component (semantic independence) and animage representation can be changed without any effect on applications using it(representation independence). The architecture involves different image sources includingWWW-servers and file systems.

Query optimization and execution plan generation in object-oriented data management systems,Dave D.  Straube; M Tamer Ozsu,The generation of execution plans for object-oriented database queries is a new andchallenging area of study. Unlike relational algebra; a common set of object algebraoperators has not been defined. Similarly; a standardized object manager interfaceanalogous to the storage manager interface of relational subsystems does not exist. Wedefine the interface to an object manager whose operations are the executable elements ofquery execution plans. Parameters to the object manager interface are streams of tuples ofobject identifiers. The object manager can apply methods and simple predicates to theobjects identified in a tuple. Two algorithms for generating such execution plans for queriesexpressed in an object algebra are presented. The first algorithm runs quickly but mayproduce inefficient plans. The second algorithm enumerates all possible execution plans …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1995,52
Modeling and analysis of distributed database concurrency control algorithms using an extended Petri net formalism,M Tamer Ozsu,Distributed database systems (DDBS) have received considerable attention in recent years.Being a relatively young research field; there are still many problems associated with DDBsystems that need solution. Concurrency control is one of these problems and; probably; themost extensively studied. However; most of the work has concentrated on the developmentof alternative solutions and the field seems to be ready for some comparative analysis work.This paper reports the results of a performance evaluation study on distributed databaseconcurrency control algorithms. The research has resulted in the development of aformalism; based on Petri nets; for modeling and analysis purposes. The formalism; calledthe Extended Place/Transition Nets (EPTN); is both descriptively powerful in that it can beused to model various algorithms precisely and succinctly and to communicate them in a …,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1985,51
A framework for supporting dbms-like indexes in the cloud,Gang Chen; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Özsu,ABSTRACT To support “Database as a service”(DaaS) in the cloud; the database system isexpected to provide similar functionalities as in centralized DBMS such as efficientprocessing of ad hoc queries. The system must therefore support DBMS-like indexes;possibly a few indexes for each table to provide fast location of data distributed over thenetwork. In such a distributed environment; the indexes have to be distributed over thenetwork to achieve scalability and reliability. Each cluster node maintains a subset of theindex data. As in conventional DBMS; indexes incur maintenance overhead and theproblem is more complex in the distributed environment since the data are typicallypartitioned and distributed based on a subset of attributes. Further; the distribution ofindexes is not straight forward; and there is therefore always the question of scalability; in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,48
Preventive replication in a database cluster,Esther Pacitti; Cédric Coulon; Patrick Valduriez; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In a database cluster; preventive replication can provide strong consistency withoutthe limitations of synchronous replication. In this paper; we present a full solution forpreventive replication that supports multi-master and partial configurations; wheredatabases are partially replicated at different nodes. To increase transaction throughput; wepropose an optimization that eliminates delay at the expense of a few transaction aborts andwe introduce concurrent replica refreshment. We describe large-scale experimentation ofour algorithm based on our RepDB* prototype (http://www. sciences. univ-nantes.fr./lina/ATLAS/RepDB) over a cluster of 64 nodes running the PostgreSQL DBMS. Ourexperimental results using the TPC-C Benchmark show that the proposed approach yieldsexcellent scale-up and speed-up.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2005,48
Query optimization for structured documents based on knowledge on the document type definition,Klemens Bohm; Karl Aberer; M Tamer Ozsu; Kathrin Gayer,Declarative access mechanisms for structured document collections and for semi-structureddata are becoming increasingly important. Using a rule-based approach for queryoptimization and applying it to such queries; we deploy knowledge on Document TypeDefinition (DTD) to formulate transformation rules for query-algebra terms. Specifically; welook at rules that serve navigation along paths by cutting off these paths or by replacing themwith access operations to indices; ie; materialized views on paths. We show for both casesthat we correctly apply and completely exploit knowledge on the DTD; and we briefly discussperformance results.,Research and Technology Advances in Digital Libraries; 1998.

We extend the frequently used four directional relationssouth; north; west; and east into twelve directional relations by adding southwest; southeast;northwest; northeast; left; right; above; and below. Furthermore; we de ne a set of topologicalrelations which are equivalent to the widely used eight topological relations. One of majorcontributions of this paper is to present a complete and formal de nitions of both directionaland topological relations.

An Asynchronous Avoidance-Based Cache Consistency Algorithm for Client Caching DBMSs.,M Tamer Özsu; Kaladhar Voruganti; Ronald C Unrau,Abstract We present a new client cache consistency algorithm for client caching databasemanagement systems. The algorithm; called Asynchronous Avoidance-based CacheConsistency (AACC); provides both good performance as well as a low abort rate. Wepresent simulation results that compare AACC with two leading cache consistencyalgorithms: Adaptive Callback Locking (ACBL) and Adaptive Optimistic Concurrency Control(AOCC). Callback cache consistency (eg ACBL) is the most widely implemented algorithmdue to its low abort rate and good performance. AOCC is an optimistic algorithm that hasbeen shown to outperform ACBL under certain workload and system configurations. Untilnow one could either have high performance and high abort rate as in AOCC; or relativelylower performance but the low abort rate of ACBL. Our performance study shows that …,VLDB,1998,43

Dynamic skyline queries in large graphs,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Given a set of query points; a dynamic skyline query reports all data points that arenot dominated by other data points according to the distances between data points andquery points.

Although dynamic skylines have been studied in Euclidean space [14]; roadnetwork [5]; and metric space [3; 6]; there is no previous work on dynamic skylines over largegraphs.

Advances in Object-Oriented Database Systems,Asuman Dogac; M Tamer Özsu; Alexandros Biliris; Timos Sellis,Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) have generated significantexcitement in the database community in the last decade. This interest stems from a realneed for data management support for what are called" advanced application areas" that arenot well-served by relational technology. The case for object-oriented technology has beenmade on three fronts. First is the data modeling requirements of the new applications. Someof the more important shortcomings of the relational systems in meeting the requirements ofthese applications include: 1. Relational systems deal with a single object type: a relation. Arelation is used to model different real-world objects; but the semantics of this association isnot part of the database. Furthermore; the attributes of a relation may come only from simpleand fixed data type domains (numeric; character; and; sometimes; date types). Advanced …,*,2013,35

Efforts havebeen made to design query languages with proper semantics to facilitate query optimizationand processing in existing database systems. The majority of multimedia database systemsare built on top of object or object-relational database systems with the underlying queryfacilities inherited.

The pivot ofplaying materialized views efficiently is view selection. Though studied for over thirty years inrdbms; the selection is hard to make in the context of xml databases; where both the semi-structured data and the expressiveness of xml query languages add challenges to the viewselection problem. We start our discussion on producing minimal xml views (in terms of size)as candidates for a given workload (a query set). To facilitate intuitionistic view selection; wepresent a view graph (called vcube) to structurally maintain all generated views. By basingour selection on vcube for materialization; we propose two view selection strategies;targeting at space-optimized and space-time tradeoff; respectively.

A video clip issegmented into a set of common appearance intervals (CAIs). A CAI is a time interval thatvideo objects appear together. Transitions among CAIs record the appearance/disappearance of video objects. Depending on the properties of video objects; they areclassified as foreground and background video objects. Foreground video objects arefurther divided into moving video objects and static video objects. Different models aredesigned to capture these video objects and spatio-temporal relationships amongforeground video objects.,Multimedia and Expo; 2002. ICME'02.

The framework takes as input any available information about input streambehaviors and the requirements of the query processing layer; and adaptively decides howto adjust the entry points of streams to the system. As the optimization decisions propagateearly from input management layer to the query processing layer; the size of the cluster isminimized; the load balance is maintained; and latency bounds of queries are met in a moreeffective and timely manner. Declarative integration of external meta-data about datasources makes the system more robust and resource-efficient. Additionally; exploitingknowledge about queries moves data partitioning to the input management layer; where …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2013,29

The one piece in the puzzle that largelyremains a centralized solution is the database. There is; of course; much work done onscaling and parallelizing databases. In fact; several products support deployment onclusters. Clustered databases; however; place the emphasis on single applications andtarget very large databases. By contrast; the middleware platforms just mentioned useclustered deployment not only for scalability but also for efficiently supporting multiple …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2006,29
Workload matters: Why RDF databases need a new design,Güneş Aluç; M Tamer Özsu; Khuzaima Daudjee,Abstract The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for conceptuallydescribing data on the Web; and SPARQL is the query language for RDF. As RDF isbecoming widely utilized; RDF data management systems are being exposed to morediverse and dynamic workloads. Existing systems are workload-oblivious; and are thereforeunable to provide consistently good performance. We propose a vision for a workload-awareand adaptive system. To realize this vision; we re-evaluate relevant existing physical designcriteria for RDF and address the resulting set of new challenges.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,28
Axiomatization of dynamic schema evolution in object bases,Randal J Peters; M Tamer Ozsu,The schema of a system consists of the constructs that model its entities. Schema evolutionis the timely change and management of the schema. Dynamic schema evolution is themanagement of schema changes while the system is in operation. We propose a sound andcomplete axiomatic model for dynamic schema evolution in object-base managementsystems (OBMSs) that support subtyping and property inheritance. The model is formal;which distinguishes it from the traditional approach of informally defining a number ofinvariants and rules to enforce them. By reducing systems to the axiomatic model; theirfunctionality with respect to dynamic schema evolution can be compared within a commonframework.,Data Engineering; 1995.

Transaction models and transaction management in object-oriented database management systems,M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Transactions are important primitives to provide reliability and controlled access toshared databases. The theory and practice of conventional transaction managementinvolving simple read/write transactions and enforcing serializability have already beendeveloped. In the case of object-oriented database management systems; the traditionaltransaction management techniques are not sufficient and more powerful transactionmodels and more flexible correctness criteria need to be developed. The additionalcomplexity of these systems proves to be a significant obstacle to their development. In thispaper we review both the problems and the approaches that have been proposed to tacklethese problems.,*,1994,28
Reflection in a uniform behavioral object model,Randal J Peters,Abstract We present the uniform meta-architecture of the TIGUKAT object model and showhow it provides reflection in objectbase management systems. Reflection is the ability for asystem to manage information about itself and to access (or reason about) this informationthrough the regular access primitives of the model. The TIGUKAT object model is purelybehavioral in nature; supports full encapsulation of objects; defines a clear separationbetween primitive components such as types; classes; collections; behaviors; functions; etc.;and incorporates a uniform semantics over objects. The architecture of its meta-system isuniformly represented within itself; which gives a clean semantics for reflection.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1993,28
Rule-based scene extraction from video,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu,Instead of clustering video shots into scenes using low level image features; in this paper;we propose a rule-based model to extract simple dialog or action scenes. Throughanalyzing video editing rules and observing temporal appearance patterns of shots in dialogscenes of movies; we deduce a set of rules to recognize dialog or action scenes. Based onthese rides; a finite state machine is designed to extract dialog or action scenes from videosautomatically.,Image Processing. 2002. Proceedings. 2002 International Conference on,2002,27
Main-memory hash joins on modern processor architectures,Çağrı Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,Existing main-memory hash join algorithms for multi-core can be classified into two camps.Hardware-oblivious hash join variants do not depend on hardware-specific parameters.Rather; they consider qualitative characteristics of modern hardware and are expected toachieve good performance on any technologically similar platform. The assumption behindthese algorithms is that hardware is now good enough at hiding its own limitations-throughautomatic hardware prefetching; out-of-order execution; or simultaneous multi-threading(SMT)-to make hardware-oblivious algorithms competitive without the overhead of carefullytuning to the underlying hardware. Hardware-conscious implementations; such as (parallel)radix join; aim to maximally exploit a given architecture by tuning the algorithm parameters(eg; hash table sizes) to the particular features of the architecture.

A poisson model for user accesses to web pages,Şule Gündüz; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Predicting the next request of a user as she visits Web pages has gainedimportance as Web-based activity increases. There are a number of different approaches toprediction. This paper concentrates on the discovery and modelling of the user's aggregateinterest in a session. This approach relies on the premise that the visiting time of a page isan indicator of the user's interest in that page. Even the same person may have differentdesires at different times. Although the approach does not use the sequential patterns oftransactions; experimental evaluation shows that the approach is quite effective in capturinga Web user's access pattern. The model has an advantage over previous proposals in termsof speed and memory usage.,International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences,2003,26
Reliable transaction execution in multidatabase systems,Ken Barker; M Tamer Ozsu,The issue of executing concurrent transactions reliably in a multidatabase system isaddressed. The authors' formalization assumes the most pessimistic scenario whereindividual database managers that make up the multidatabase system are totallyautonomous. The authors present algorithms that ensure transaction atomicity and crashrecovery. The atomicity algorithms are based on the emulation of the well-known two-phasecommit protocol. It is applied among autonomous participants that neither know of eachother's existence nor how to communicate.,Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1991. IMS'91.

Processing SPARQL queries over distributed RDF graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract We propose techniques for processing SPARQL queries over a large RDF graph ina distributed environment. We adopt a “partial evaluation and assembly” framework.Answering a SPARQL query Q is equivalent to finding subgraph matches of the query graphQ over RDF graph G. Based on properties of subgraph matching over a distributed graph;we introduce local partial match as partial answers in each fragment of RDF graph G. Forassembly; we propose two methods: centralized and distributed assembly. We analyze ouralgorithms from both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments over both realand benchmark RDF repositories of billions of triples confirm that our method is superior tothe state-of-the-art methods in both the system's performance and scalability.,The VLDB Journal,2016,25
A framework for testing DBMS features,Eric Lo; Carsten Binnig; Donald Kossmann; M Tamer Özsu; Wing-Kai Hon,Abstract Testing a specific feature of a DBMS requires controlling the inputs and outputs ofthe operators in the query execution plan. However; that is practically difficult to achievebecause the inputs/outputs of a query depend on the content of the test database. In thispaper; we propose a framework to test DBMS features. The framework includes a databasegenerator called QAGen so that the generated test databases are able to meet the testrequirements defined on the test queries. The framework also includes a set of tools toautomate test case constructions and test executions. A wide range of DBMS feature testingtasks can be facilitated by the proposed framework.,The VLDB Journal,2010,25
Multi-query optimization of sliding window aggregates by schedule synchronization,Lukasz Golab; Kumar Gaurav Bijay; M Tamer Özsu,Data stream management systems process on-line data such as sensor measurements; IPpacket headers; stock quotes; and transaction logs. Usually; only a sliding window ofrecently arrived data is available at any given time for two reasons: to avoid memoryoverflow and to emphasize recent data that are likely to be more useful. Users issuepersistent queries that monitor the streaming data over some period of time. As such;persistent queries often compute sliding window aggregates; such as road traffic volume viasensors embedded in a motorway; network bandwidth usage statistics; or recent behaviourof stock prices. For efficiency; answers of persistent queries are typically assumed to beupdated periodically with some user-specified frequency or re-execution interval. Similarmonitoring queries may run in parallel at any given time; for example; many queries may …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,25
Temporal granularity for unanchored temporal data,Iqbal A Goralwalla; Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron; Carlo Combi,A bstract Granularity is an integral feature of both anchored (eg; 25 October 1995; July 1996)and unanchored (eg; 3 min-utes; 6 hours and 20 minutes; 5 days; 1 week) temporal data. Insupporting temporal data that is speciﬁed in dif-ferent granularities; numerous approacheshave been proposed to deal with the issues of converting temporal data from one granularityto another. The emphasis; however; has only been on granularity conversions with respectto anchored temporal data. This is because a granularity in these approaches is modeled asan anchored partitioning of the time axis; thereby making it difﬁcult to deal with granularityconversions in unanchored temporal data. In this paper we provide a novel approach to thetreatment of granularity in temporal data. A granularity is modeled as a special kind ofunanchored temporal primitive that can be used as a unit of time. That is; a granularity is …,Proceedings of the seventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,1998,25

A temporal approach to managing schema evolution in object database systems,Iqbal A Goralwalla; Duane Szafron; M Tamer Özsu; Randal J Peters,Abstract The issues of schema evolution and temporal object models are generallyconsidered to be orthogonal and are handled independently. However; to properly modelapplications that need incremental design and experimentation; the evolutionary histories ofthe schema objects should be traceable rather than corrective so that historical queries canbe supported. In this paper we propose a method for managing schema changes; andpropagating these changes to object instances by exploiting the functionality of a temporalobject model. The result is a uniform treatment of schema evolution and temporal support formany object database management systems applications that require both.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1998,24

Answering pattern match queries in large graph databases via graph embedding,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract The growing popularity of graph databases has generated interesting datamanagement problems; such as subgraph search; shortest path query; reachabilityverification; and pattern matching. Among these; a pattern match query is more flexiblecompared with a subgraph search and more informative compared with a shortest path or areachability query. In this paper; we address distance-based pattern match queries over alarge data graph G. Due to the huge search space; we adopt a filter-and-refine framework toanswer a pattern match query over a large graph. We first find a set of candidate matches bya graph embedding technique and then evaluate these to find the exact matches. Extensiveexperiments confirm the superiority of our method.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,22
Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor for lp-norm in two-and three-dimensional spaces,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; M Tamer Özsu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Philip S Yu; Lian Liu; Yubao Liu,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) has been extensively studied inspatial database literature. In this paper; we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: findan optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs for L p-norm in two-and three-dimensional spaces. Such a problem has many real-life applications; including the problemof finding a new server point that attracts as many customers as possible by proximity. Astraightforward approach is to determine the BRNNs for all possible points that are notfeasible since there are a large (or infinite) number of possible points. To the best of ourknowledge; there are no existing algorithms which solve MaxBRNN for any L p-norm spaceof two-and three-dimensionality. Based on some interesting properties of the problem; wecome up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap for to solve this problem.

Using multi-scale histograms to answer pattern existence and shape match queries over time series data,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract Similarity-based querying of time series data can be categorized as patternexistence queries and shape match queries. Pattern existence queries find the time seriesdata with certain patterns while shape match queries look for the time series data that havesimilar movement shapes. Existing proposals address one of these or the other. In thispaper; we propose multi-scale time series histograms that can be used to answer both typesof queries; thus offering users more flexibility. Multiple histogram levels allow querying atvarious precision levels. Most importantly; the distances of time series histograms at lowerscale are lower bounds of the distances at higher scale; which guarantees that no falsedismissals will be introduced when a multi-step filtering process is used in answering shapematch queries. We further propose to use averages of time series histograms to reduce …,Proc. of 17th Int Conf. on Scientific and Statistical Database Management; CA; USA,2005,22
Modeling Video Data for Content Based Queries: Extending the DISIMA Image Data Model.,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,We present an efficient video data model that extends the DISIMA image data model byadding the video components and setting up links between image and video data. Manyvideo data models have been proposed; most of which describe video data independently ofimage data and therefore fail to consider the relationship between videos and images. Ourproposed model expresses the semantics of video data content by means of salient objectsand relationships among them. Connections between video data and DISIMA images aremade through key frames; which are extracted from each shot. Based on these connections;techniques used to query image data may be used to query video data. In addition; a set ofnew predicates has been defined to describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of salientobjects in the video data.

Modeling temporal primitives: back to basics,Iqbal A Goralwalla; Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract The fundamental question about a temporal model is “what is its underlyingtemporal structure?” More specifically; what are the temporal primitives supported in themodel; what temporat domains are available over these primitives; and whether theprimitives are determinate or indeterminate? In this paper a simple; general framework forsupporting temporal primitives (iitants; intervals; sets of intervals) is presented. The tieworkallows seamless integration of dense and discrete temporal domains of time over a linearlyordered; unbounded point strncture. The framework also provides a set-theoretic basis thatallows uniform treatment of determinate and indeterminate temporal primitives.,Proceedings of the sixth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1997,22
TIGUKAT: An object model for query and view support in object database systems,Randal J Peters; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract Object-oriented computing is in uencing many areas of computer science includingsoftware engineering; user interfaces; operating systems; programming languages anddatabase systems. The appeal of object-orientation is attributed to its higher levels ofabstraction for modeling real world concepts; its support for incremental development and itspotential for interoperability. Despite many advances; object-oriented computing is still in itsinfancy and a universally acceptable definition of an object-oriented data model is virtuallynonexistent; although some standardization e orts are underway.

Execution plan generation for an object-oriented data model,Dave D Straube; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract We address the generation of execution plans for object-oriented database queries.This is a challenging area of study because; unlike the relational algebra; a uniformlyaccepted set of object algebra operators has not been defined. Additionally; a standardizedobject manager interface analogous to storage manager interfaces of relational systemsdoes not exist. We define the interface to an object manager whose operations are theexecutable elements of query execution plans. Parameters to the object manager interfaceare streams of tuples of object identifiers. The object manager can apply methods andsimple predicates to the objects identified in a tuple. Two algorithms for generatingexecution plans for queries expressed in an object algebra are presented. The first algorithmruns quickly but may produce inefficient plans.

Flexible integration of multimedia sub-queries with qualitative preferences,Ilaria Bartolini; Paolo Ciaccia; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Complex multimedia queries; aiming to retrieve from large databases those objectsthat best match the query specification; are usually processed by splitting them into a set ofm simpler sub-queries; each dealing with only some of the query features. To determinewhich are the overall best-matching objects; a rule is then needed to integrate the results ofsuch sub-queries; ie; how to globally rank the m-dimensional vectors of matching degrees;or partial scores; that objects obtain on the m sub-queries. It is a fact that state-of-the-artapproaches all adopt as integration rule a scoring function; such as weighted average; thataggregates the m partial scores into an overall (numerical) similarity score; so that objectscan be linearly ordered and only the highest scored ones returned to the user. This choicehowever forces the system to compromise between the different sub-queries and can …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2007,21
Incremental click-stream tree model: Learning from new users for web page prediction,Şule Güunüz ÖĞÜdÜcÜ; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Predicting the next request of a user has gained importance as Web-based activityincreases in order to guide Web users during their visits to Web sites. Previously proposedmethods for recommendation use data collected over time in order to extract usage patterns.However; these patterns may change over time; because each day new log entries areadded to the database and old entries are deleted. Thus; over time it is highly desirable toperform the update of the recommendation model incrementally. In this paper; we propose anew model for modeling and predicting Web user sessions which attempt to reduce theonline recommendation time while retaining predictive accuracy. Since it is very easy tomodify the model; it is updated during the recommendation process. The incrementalalgorithm yields a better prediction accuracy as well as a shorter online recommendation …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2006,21
Concurrent transaction execution in multidatabase systems,Ken Barker; M Tamer Ozsu,Multidatabase serializability is defined as an extension of the well-known serializabilitytheory in order to provide a theoretical framework for research in concurrency control oftransactions over multidatabase systems. Also introduced are multidatabase serializabilitygraphs which capture the ordering characteristics of global as well as local transactions.Two schedulers that produce multidatabase serializable histories are described. The firstscheduler is a conservative one which only permits one global subtransaction to proceed ifall of the global subtransactions can proceed for any given global transaction. The'all ornothing'approach of this algorithm is simple; elegant; and correct. The second scheduler ismore aggressive in that it attempts to schedule as many global subtransactions as possibleas soon as possible.

Wethen use this system to carry out experiments on the performance of different types oftemporal databases: databases using attribute timestamping; databases using tupletimestamping where relations are in temporal normal form and databases using tupletimestamping where a single relation is used. We run sample queries against these types oftemporal databases and measure the processing time of these queries.

Examplesinclude sliding windows over online data streams; where old data are dropped as thewindow slides forward. Previous research on management of data with finite lifetimes hasemphasized online query processing in main memory. In this paper; we address theproblem of indexing time-evolving data on disk for offline analysis. In order to reduce the I/Ocosts of index updates; existing work partitions the data chronologically. This way; only theoldest partition is examined for expirations; only the youngest partition incurs insertions; andthe remaining partitions" in the middle" are not accessed. However; this solution is basedupon the assumption that the order in which the data are inserted is equivalent to theexpiration order; which means that the lifetime of each data item is the same.

A general-purpose query-centric framework for querying big graphs,Da Yan; James Cheng; M Tamer Özsu; Fan Yang; Yi Lu; John Lui; Qizhen Zhang; Wilfred Ng,Abstract Pioneered by Google's Pregel; many distributed systems have been developed forlarge-scale graph analytics. These systems employ a user-friendly" think like a vertex"programming model; and exhibit good scalability for tasks where the majority of graphvertices participate in computation.

In this work; we develop a new open-source system; called Quegel; for querying big graphs.

Optimizing multi-top-k queries over uncertain data streams,Tao Chen; Lei Chen; M Tamer Oezsu; Nong Xiao,Query processing over uncertain data streams; in particular top-κ query processing; hasbecome increasingly important due to its wide application in many fields such as sensornetwork monitoring and internet traffic control. In many real applications; multiple top-κqueries are registered in the system. Sharing the results of these queries is a key factor insaving the computation cost and providing real-time response. However; due to the complexsemantics of uncertain top-κ query processing; it is nontrivial to implement sharing amongdifferent top-κ queries and few works have addressed the sharing issue.

An adaptive data-shipping architecture for client caching data management systems,Kaladhar Voruganti; M Tamer Özsu; Ronald C Unrau,Abstract Data-shipping is an important form of data distribution architecture where dataobjects are retrieved from the server; and are cached and operated upon at the client nodes.This architecture reduces network latency and increases resource utilization at the client.Object database management systems (ODBMS); file-systems; mobile data managementsystems; multi-tiered Web-server systems and hybrid query-shipping/data-shippingarchitectures all use some variant of the data-shipping. Despite a decade of research; thereis still a lack of consensus amongst the proponents of ODBMSs as to the type of datashipping architectures and algorithms that should be used. The absence of both robust (withrespect to performance) algorithms; and a comprehensive performance study comparing thecompeting algorithms are the key reasons for this lack of agreement.

Multimedia documents are composite objects where thecomponent objects have spatial and temporal relationships which need to be captured in thedatabase. Modeling of multimedia documents involves three issues:(1) modeling ofindividual document components (ie; monomedia objects such as text; images; etc);(2)modeling of the document structure; and (3) modeling of the presentation structure.

Type consistency of queries in an object-oriented database system,Dave D Straube; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Queries in object-oriented databases can return non-homogeneous sets of objectswhen no type restrictions are placed on the inputs to the query. The tradition has been toforce homogeneity on the result by restricting the types of the inputs. This restricts the rangeof permissible; and possibly useful; queries. We propose a type consistency theory forqueries in object-oriented databases which supports the existence of multiple types in thequery result. The technique is illustrated by developing type inference rules for an objectalgebra. The main result is that the loss of type information associated with a queryoperation is reduced in most cases. We also show how type information is increased whenqueries are qualified by conjunctive predicates.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1990,16
R-store: a scalable distributed system for supporting real-time analytics,Feng Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,It is widely recognized that OLTP and OLAP queries have different data access patterns;processing needs and requirements. Hence; the OLTP queries and OLAP queries aretypically handled by two different systems; and the data are periodically extracted from theOLTP system; transformed and loaded into the OLAP system for data analysis. With theawareness of the ability of big data in providing enterprises useful insights from vastamounts of data; effective and timely decisions derived from real-time analytics areimportant. It is therefore desirable to provide real-time OLAP querying support; where OLAPqueries read the latest data while OLTP queries create the new versions. In this paper; wepropose R-Store; a scalable distributed system for supporting real-time OLAP by extendingthe MapReduce framework. We extend an open source distributed key/value system …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,15
Similarity-based retrieval of time-series data using multi-scale histograms,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract Queries for similarity-based time series data retrieval can be categorized into twotypes:(1) pattern existence queries; and (2) exact match queries. Pattern existence queriesfind the time series data with certain patterns while exact match queries search over the timeseries data by specifying exact values and detailed temporal information. In this paper; wepropose multi-scale time series histograms that can be used to answer both types of queries;thus offering users more flexibility. The experimental results show that multi-scalehistograms can effectively find the patterns in time series data as well as answer exact matchqueries; even when the data contain noise; local time shifting; local time scaling; amplitudeshifting and amplitude scaling.,Computer sciences technical report; CS-2003-31; University of Waterloo; Waterloo,2003,15
On separation between interface; implementation; and representation in object DBMSs,Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,In this paper we present a model that supports a clean separation between the concepts ofinterface; implementation; and representation. We present several problems that are difficultto solve in the absence of such separation and describe how the proposed model can beused to provide a solution. We also describe the principles that can be used to implementthe proposed model in an existing object-oriented database management system.,Technology of Object-Oriented Languages; 1998. TOOLS 26.

2D-h trees: an index scheme for content-based retrieval of images in multimedia systems,Youping Niu; M Ozsu; Xiaobo Li,An important feature to be considered in the design of a multimedia database system(MMDBS) is content based retrieval of images. Spatial features represent the spatialrelationships among objects in an image. The salient objects (interesting objects) can beorganized in an object hierarchy; based on object oriented concepts. The paper proposesan indexing scheme; called 2D-h trees; for content based retrieval of images. This schemeorganizes the representations of the spatial relationships among objects in images and thehierarchical relationships among objects efficiently for query optimization. Our performanceanalysis indicates that the 2D-h-tree is an efficient index scheme for content based retrievalof images.,Intelligent Processing Systems; 1997.

chameleon-db: a workload-aware robust RDF data management system,Günes Aluç; M Tamer Ozsu; Khuzaima Daudjee; Olaf Hartig,ABSTRACT The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) standard for the conceptual modeling of web resources; and SPARQL is the standardquery language for RDF. As RDF is becoming more widely utilized; RDF data managementsystems are being exposed to workloads that are much more diverse and dynamic than theywere designed to support; for which they are unable to provide consistently goodperformance. The problem arises because these systems are workload-agnostic; that is;they rely on a database structure and types of indexes that are fixed a priori; which cannotbe modified at runtime. In this paper; we introduce chameleon-db; which is a workload-aware RDF data management system that we have developed. chameleon-db automaticallyand periodically adjusts its layout of the RDF database to optimize for queries so that they …,University of Waterloo; Tech.

Managing schema evolution using a temporal object model,Iqbal A Goralwalla; Duane Szafron; M Tamer Özsu; Randal J Peters,Abstract The issues of schema evolution and temporal object models are generallyconsidered to be orthogonal and are handled independently. This is unrealistic because toproperly model applications that need incremental design and experimentation (such asCAD; software design process); the evolutionary histories of the schema objects should betraceable. In this paper we propose a method for managing schema changes by exploitingthe functionality of a temporal object model. The result is a uniform treatment of schemaevolution and temporal support for many object database management systems applicationsthat require both.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1997,14
Towards a general concurrency control algorithm for database systems,Abdel A Farrag; M Tamer Ozsu,The concurrency control problem in database systems has been examined by many peopleand several concurrency control algorithms have been proposed. The most popularalgorithms are two-phase locking and timestamp ordering. This paper shows that two-phaselocking and timestamp ordering are special cases of a more general concurrency controlalgorithm. This general algorithm is described in detail and is proven to work correctly. Weshow that two-phase locking and timestamp ordering represent the two end points of aseries of concurrency control algorithms. Each of them is a special case of the generalalgorithm proposed in this paper. Moreover; each of these special cases can be selected inadvance; and can even be changed dynamically during execution.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1987,14
Linked data query processing,Olaf Hartig; M Tamer Ozsu,The publication of Linked Open Data on the Web has gained tremendous momentum overthe last six years. As a consequence; we currently witness the emergence of a new researcharea that focuses on an online execution of Linked Data queries; ie; declarative queries thatrange over Web data that is made available using the Linked Data publishing principles.These principles only require Web servers that respond to simple requests for data aboutgiven entities. Therefore; in contrast to approaches for querying a more traditional distributeddatabase; Linked Data query processing approaches cannot assume that data sourcesprovide query processing functionality. Additional challenges are the unbounded nature ofthe Web and the lack of a complete; up-to-date database catalog that lists all data sources.Our tutorial provides an overview of the new area of Linked Data query processing.

InterJoin: Exploiting indexes and materialized views in XPath evaluation,Derek Phillips; Ning Zhang; Ihab F Ilyas; M Tamer Ozsu,XML has become the standard for data exchange for a wide variety of applications;particularly in the scientific community. In order to efficiently process queries on XMLrepresentations of scientific data; we require specialized techniques for evaluating XPathexpressions. Exploiting materialized views in query processing significantly enhances queryprocessing performance. We propose a novel view definition that allows for intermediate(structural) join results to be stored and reused in XML query evaluation. Unlike current XMLview proposals; our views do not require navigation in the original document or path-basedpattern matching. Hence; they are evaluated significantly faster and are easily costed as partof a query plan. In general; current structural joins cannot exploit views efficiently when theview definition is not a prefix (or a suffix) of the XPath query.

DISIMA: An object-oriented approach to developing an image database system,Vincent Oria; M Tarner Ozsu; Paul J Iglinski; B Bu; L Irene Cheng,Most image database prototypes and products focus mainly on similarity searches oversyntactic features of images. DISIMA aims at providing querying on both syntactic andsemantic features of images. The content of an image is viewed as a set of salient objects(regions of interest). Salient objects are organized into two levels: physical salient objectsthat store syntactic features and logical salient objects that give the semantics. DISIMAintegrates a declarative query language (MOQL) and a visual query language(VisualMOQL).,Data Engineering; 2000. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2000,13
A framework for temporal data models: exploiting object-oriented technology,Iqbal A Goralwalla; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Most database research on modeling time has concentrated on the definition of a particulartemporal model and its incorporation into a (relational or object) database managementsystem. This has resulted in quite a large number of different temporal models; eachproviding a specific set of temporal features. This paper presents an object-orientedframework for temporal models which supports multiple notions of time. The framework canbe used to accommodate the temporal needs of different applications and to derive existingtemporal models by making a series of design decisions through subclass specialization. Itcan also be used to derive a series of new; more general temporal models that meet theneeds of a growing number of emerging applications.,Technology of Object-Oriented Languages and Systems; 1997.

Approximate query processing,Qing Liu,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,12
MINDEX: An efficient index structure for salient-object-based queries in video databases,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract. Several salient-object-based data models have been proposed to model videodata. However; none of them addresses the development of an index structure to efficientlyhandle salient-object-based queries. There are several indexing schemes that have beenproposed for spatiotemporal relationships among objects; and they are used to optimizetimestamp and interval queries; which are rarely used in video databases. Moreover; theseindex structures are designed without consideration of the granularity levels of constraintson salient objects and the characteristics of video data. In this paper; we propose amultilevel index structure (MINDEX) to efficiently handle the salient-object-based querieswith different levels of constraints. We present experimental results showing theperformance of different methods of MINDEX construction.,Multimedia Systems,2004,11

Mining user behavior for resource prediction in interactive electronic malls,Silvia Hollfelder; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu,Applications in virtual multimedia catalogs are highly interactive. Thus; it is difficult toestimate resource demands required for presentation of catalog contents. We propose amethod to predict presentation resource demands in interactive multimedia catalogs. Theprediction is based on the results of mining the virtual mall action log file. The log filetypically contains information about previous user interests and browsing behavior. Thesedata are used for modeling users future behavior within a session. We define heuristics togenerate a start-up user behavior model as a continuous time Markov chain and adapt thismodel during a running session to the current user.,Multimedia and Expo; 2000.

Building interoperable databases on distributed object management platforms,Asuman Dogac; Cevdet Dengi; M Tamer Ozsu,A common characteristic of today's information systems is the distribution of data among anumber of autonomous and heterogeneous repositories. Increasingly; these repositories aredatabase management systems (DBMS); but there is still a very large volume of data that isstored in le systems; spreadsheets and others. A fundamental challenge in building nextgeneration information systems is to provide interoperability among these autonomous andpotentially heterogeneous repositories. The commercial state-of-the-art in addressing theinteroperability of DBMSs is to build gateways. This approach is quite restricted andprovides only a partial solution. Some gateways are binary and only interconnect twoDBMSs (eg; Oracle 7's Dedicated Transparent Gateway); others do not provide transactionsacross multiple DBMSs (eg; Sybase's OmniSQL Gateway).

Distributed XML query processing: Fragmentation; localization and pruning,Patrick Kling; M Tamer Ozsu; Khuzaima Daudjee,Abstract Distributing data collections by fragmenting them is an effective way of improvingthe scalability of a database system. While the distribution of relational data is wellunderstood; the unique characteristics of XML data and its query model present challengesthat require different distribution techniques. In this paper; we show how XML data can befragmented horizontally and vertically. Based on this; we propose solutions to two of theproblems encountered in distributed query processing and optimization on XML data;namely localization and pruning. Localization takes a fragmentation-unaware query planand converts it to a distributed query plan that can be executed at the sites that hold XMLdata fragments in a distributed system. We then show how the resulting distributed queryplan can be pruned so that only those sites are accessed that can contribute to the query …,University of Waterloo; Tech. Rep. CS-2010-02,2010,10
Mining data streams with periodically changing distributions,Yingying Tao; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract Dynamic data streams are those whose underlying distribution changes over time.They occur in a number of application domains; and mining them is important for theseapplications. Coupled with the unboundedness and high arrival rates of data streams; thedynamism of the underlying distribution makes data mining challenging. In this paper; wefocus on a large class of dynamic streams that exhibit periodicity in distribution changes. Wepropose a framework; called DMM; for mining this class of streams that includes a newchange detection technique and a novel match-and-reuse approach. Once a distributionchange is detected; we compare the new distribution with a set of historically observeddistribution patterns and use the mining results from the past if a match is detected. Since; fortwo highly similar distributions; their mining results should also present high similarity; by …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,10
Mining frequent itemsets in time-varying data streams,Yingying Tao; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Mining frequent itemsets in data streams is beneficial to many real-worldapplications but is also a challenging task since data streams are unbounded and have higharrival rates. Moreover; the distribution of data streams can change over time; which makesthe task of maintaining frequent itemsets even harder. In this paper; we propose a false-negative oriented algorithm; called TWIM; that can find most of the frequent itemsets; detectdistribution changes; and update the mining results accordingly. Experimental results showthat our algorithm performs as good as other false-negative algorithms on data streamswithout distribution change; and has the ability to detect changes over time-varying datastreams in-time with a high accuracy rate.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,10
On concurrency control in sliding window queries over data streams,Lukasz Golab; Kumar Gaurav Bijay; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Data stream systems execute a dynamic workload of long-running and one-timequeries; with the streaming inputs typically bounded by sliding windows. For efficiency;windows may be advanced periodically by replacing the oldest part of the window with abatch of new data. Existing work on stream processing assumes that a window cannot beadvanced while it is being accessed by a query. In this paper; we argue that concurrentprocessing of queries (reads) and window-slides (writes) is required by data stream systemsin order to allow prioritized query scheduling and improve the freshness of answers. Weprove that the traditional notion of conflict serializability is insufficient in this context anddefine stronger isolation levels that restrict the allowed serialization orders.

Modeling shapes in an image database system,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; PJ Iglinski; Y Leontiev,Abstract Due to the complex modeling requirement of data handled by image and spatialdatabases; they are most often built on top of object-oriented or object-relational databases.In the DISIMA image database; an image is composed of salient objects and a salient objecthas a shape which is a geometric object. The object-oriented modeling of shapes potentiallyconflicts with the mathematical definitions of geometric objects. Mathematically; a triangleand a rectangle are polygons and a square is a special kind of rectangle. Accordingly; aclass Triangle should be a subclass of the class Polygon. In the same way; a class Squareshould be a subclass of Rectangle which; in turn; should be defined as a subclass ofPolygon. But from the point of view of data representation; this leads to a conflict: A polygonminimally requires a list of n consecutive points for its description; whereas a rectangle …,Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Multimedia Information System,1999,10
Modeling time: Back to basics,Iqbal Goralwalla; Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,In the last decade there has been extensive research activity on temporal databases (seeSno95a; OS95; Sno86; SS88; Soo91; Kli93; Sno90; Pea94; TCG+93]). Most of this researchhas concentrated on the de nition of a particular temporal model and its incorporation into a(relational or object-oriented) database management system (DBMS).

In thispaper; we propose a novel graph-structured routing synopsis; called kd-synopsis; fordeployment over unstructured super-peer based P2P networks. This synopsis is based onlength-constrained FBsimulation relationship; which allows the balancing of the precisionand size of the synopsis according to different space constraints on peers withheterogeneous capacity.

Integrating the Results of Multimedia Sub-Queries Using Qualitative Preferences.,Ilaria Bartolini; Paolo Ciaccia; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract When similarity queries over multimedia databases are processed by splitting theoverall query condition into a set of sub-queries; the problem of how to efficiently andeffectively integrate the sub-queries' results arises. The common approach is to use a(monotone) scoring function; like min and average; to compute an overall similarity score byaggregating the partial scores an object obtains on the sub-queries. In order to minimize thenumber of database accesses; a “middleware” algorithm; like TA by Fagin; Lotem and Naor;is applied to return only the top k highest scored objects. In this paper we consider the use ofqualitative preferences for the integration of partial scores. With qualitative preferences onecan define arbitrary partial (rather than only linear) orders on database objects; which addsa large flexibility and avoids some drawbacks of scoring functions when query refinement …,Multimedia Information Systems,2004,9

Many of these applications; such as location-based servicesand multimedia content distribution; require the support of range selection queries. Underthe widely-adopted query shipping protocols; the cost of query processing is affected by thenumber of result copies or replicas in the system. Since range queries can return results thatinclude poorly-replicated data items; the cost of these queries is usually dominated by theretrieval cost of these data items.

Most of the caching schemes proposed in literature are lenient about the issue ofconsistency; they assume that users can tolerate receiving stale data. However; an importantclass of dynamic Web applications are those in which users always expect to get thefreshest data available. Any caching scheme has to incur a significant overhead to be ableto provide this level of consistency (ie; strong consistency); the overhead may be so muchthat it neutralizes the benefits of caching.

A visual query facility for multimedia databases,Ghada El-Medani,Abstract Multimedia databases store large data objects with complex spatial and temporalrelationships. For users to easily and effectively access and make use of this largeinformation space; there is a need for an interactive user interface to act as an intermediarybetween the database and the user. Many existing multimedia systems provide a browsing-based user interface for their users. However; with large information spaces; browsing doesnot provide an efficient mechanism for accessing the database. Thus; there is a need for aquery facility which enables users to pose queries to the database; and; directly; retrieveinformation of interest. This research determines the user interface requirements ofmultimedia information systems and provides a template solution. That is; it presents aneasy and efficient way of accessing a multimedia database. This is achieved through a …,*,1995,8

Localizationtakes a fragmentation-unaware query plan and converts it to a distributed query plan thatcan be executed at the individual sites that hold XML data fragments in a distributed system.We then show how the resulting distributed query plan can be pruned so that only thosesites are accessed that can contribute to the query result. We demonstrate that ourtechniques can be integrated into a real-life XML database system and that they …,Relatório Técnico. Universidade de Waterloo; Ontario; Canada,2009,7

An apples-to-apples comparison of two database journals,Philip A Bernstein; Elisa Bertino; Andreas Heuer; Christian S Jensen; Holger Meyer; M Tamer Özsu; Richard T Snodgrass; Kyu-Young Whang,The editors of TODS and The VLDB Journal have col- laborated to generate historical data basedon common definitions of relevant metrics. The data reported here was first presented; in preliminaryform; at a VLDB panel [1]. This data has been updated in the intervening time to fix inconsistenciesand improve clarity. We found this to be a useful process; as the underly- ing data was cleanedand as we were able to observe some trends in metrics that had never before beencomputed. Additionally; we feel that such historical data is important for the community;authors; editors; and readers alike. The most recent data on manuscript processing times andrates is of interest to potential authors; some of the met- rics are of interest to readers in judgingthe timeliness of the material published by the journal; and the historical trends are of interestto the database community at large; as it helps us to understand how scientific publishing …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2005,7

Optimizing correlated path queries in XML languages,Ning Zhang; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract Path expressions are ubiquitous in XML processing languages such as XPath;XQuery; and XSLT. Expressions in these languages typically include multiple pathexpressions; some of them correlated. Existing approaches evaluate these path expressionsone-at-a-time and miss the optimization opportunities that may be gained by exploiting thecorrelations among them. In this paper; we address the evaluation and optimization ofcorrelated path expressions. In particular; we propose two types of optimization techniques:integrating correlated path expressions into a single pattern graph; and rewriting the patterngraph according to a set of rewriting rules. The first optimization technique allows the queryoptimizer to choose an execution plan that is impossible by using the existing approaches.The second optimization technique rewrites pattern graphs at a logical level and produce …,TR-CS-2002-36; University of Waterloo; November 2002,2002,7
A Multi-Level Index Structure for Video Databases.,Lei Chen; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu,ABSTRACT Several salient object-based data models have been proposed to model thevideo data; however; none of them proposed an index structure to handle the salient object-based queries efficiently. There are several indexing schemes that have been proposed forspatio-temporal relationships among objects and they are used to optimize timestamp andinterval queries; which are rarely used in video database. Moreover; these index structuresare designed without consideration of the granularity levels of constraints in salient objectsand the characteristics of the video data. In this paper; we propose a multi-level indexstructure to efficiently handle the salient object-based quires with different levels ofconstraints. The characteristics of video data are also captured in the second level of theindex structure designed to reduce the storage requirement.,Multimedia Information Systems,2002,7
Architectural classification and transaction execution models of multidatabase systems,M Tamer Özsu; Ken Barker,Abstract A multidatabase system is constructed from autonomous and independentdatabase managers. There is considerable confusion of terminology related tomultidatabase systems and their difference from distributed databases; heterogeneoussystems; etc. In this paper; we discuss a basic taxonomy for these systems highlighting theirfundamental features. We then present a computational model that describes theoperational characteristics of multidatabase systems. This model is used in our research ontransaction management in such systems.,International Conference on Computing and Information,1990,7
Clustering RDF databases using tunable-LSH,Güneş Aluç; M Tamer Özsu; Khuzaima Daudjee,Abstract: The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a W3C standard for representinggraph-structured data; and SPARQL is the standard query language for RDF. Recentadvances in Information Extraction; Linked Data Management and the Semantic Web haveled to a rapid increase in both the volume and the variety of RDF data that are publiclyavailable. As businesses start to capitalize on RDF data; RDF data management systemsare being exposed to workloads that are far more diverse and dynamic than what they weredesigned to handle. Consequently; there is a growing need for developing workload-adaptive and self-tuning RDF data management systems. To realize this vision; weintroduce a fast and efficient method for dynamically clustering records in an RDF datamanagement system. Specifically; we assume nothing about the workload upfront; but as …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.02523,2015,6
Confluxdb: Multi-master replication for partitioned snapshot isolation databases,Prima Chairunnanda; Khuzaima Daudjee; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Lazy replication with snapshot isolation (SI) has emerged as a popular choice fordistributed databases. However; lazy replication often requires execution of updatetransactions at one (master) site so that it is relatively easy for a total SI order to bedetermined for consistent installation of updates in the lazily replicated system. We proposea set of techniques that support update transaction execution over multiple partitioned sites;thereby allowing the master to scale. Our techniques determine a total SI order for updatetransactions over multiple master sites without requiring global coordination in thedistributed system; and ensure that updates are installed in this order at all sites to provideconsistent and scalable replication with SI. We present ConfluxDB; a PostgreSQL-basedimplementation of our techniques; and demonstrate its effectiveness through …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,6
Reachable subwebs for traversal-based query execution,Olaf Hartig; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Traversal-based approaches to execute queries over data on the Web haverecently been studied. These approaches make use of up-to-date data from initiallyunknown data sources and; thus; enable applications to tap the full potential of the Web.While existing work focuses primarily on implementation techniques; a principled analysis ofsubwebs that are reachable by such approaches is missing. Such an analysis may help togain new insight into the problem of optimizing the response time of traversal-based queryengines. Furthermore; a better understanding of characteristics of such subwebs may alsoinform approaches to benchmark these engines. This paper provides such an analysis. Inparticular; we identify typical graph-based properties of query-specific reachable subwebsand quantify their diversity. Furthermore; we investigate whether vertex scoring methods …,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,6
Efficient decision tree construction for mining time-varying data streams,Yingying Tao; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Mining streaming data has been an active research area to address requirementsof applications; such as financial marketing; telecommunication; network monitoring; and soon. A popular technique for mining these continuous and fast-arriving data streams isdecision trees. The accuracy of decision trees can deteriorate if the distribution of values inthe stream changes over time. In this paper; we propose an approach based on decisiontrees that can detect distribution changes and re-align the decision tree quickly to reflect thechange. The technique exploits a set of synopses on the leaf nodes; which are also used toprune the decision tree. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach candetect the distribution changes in real-time with high accuracy; and re-aligning a decisiontree can improve its performance in clustering the subsequent data stream tuples.,Proceedings of the 2009 Conference of the Center for Advanced Studies on Collaborative Research,2009,6
BBS: an energy efficient localized routing scheme for query processing in wireless sensor networks,Jie Lian; Kshirasagar Naik; Gordon B Agnew; Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu,A wireless sensor network (WSNET) can support various types of queries. The energyresource of sensors constrains the total number of query responses; called query capacity;received by the sink. There are four problems in the existing approaches for energy-efficientquery processing in WSNETs: the fact that sensors near the sink drain their energy muchfaster than distant sensors has been overlooked; routing trees (RT) are rooted at the sink;and therefore; aggregative queries are less energy-efficient; data reception cost has beenignored; and flooding is used in query distribution or RT construction. In this paper; wepropose a Broadcasting-Based query Scheme (BBS) to address the above problems. BBSreduces the energy depletion rate of sensors near the sink; builds different localized RTs fordifferent query types; and eliminates the flooding cost of query distribution.

Localized routing trees for query processing in sensor networks,Jie Lian; Lei Chen; Kshirasagar Naik; M Tamer Özsu; G Agnew,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel energy-efficient approach; a localized routing tree(LRT) coupled with a route redirection (RR) strategy; to support various types of queries.LRTs take care of the sensors near the sink and reduce the energy consumption of thesesensors; and RR reduces the energy cost of data receptions. Compared to the existingapproaches; simulation studies show that LRT together with RR has significant improvementon the query capacity.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,6

Building component database systems using CORBA,M Tamer Özsu; Bin Yao,The issue of componentization of a database management system (DBMS) arises becauseof the divergent requirements imposed on DBMSs by new application domains that thetechnology has started to penetrate. Building general-purpose DBMSs that can addressthese varying demands requires either that the systems themselves be customizable or thatmore open system architectures be developed that lend themselves to the integration ofdifferent DBMSs with different requirements. This chapter deals with two distributed objectcomputing platforms: Object Management Architecture (OMA) from Object ManagementGroup (OMG) and ActiveX from Microsoft. The two related models in the OMA—the objectmodel and the reference model—describe how distributed objects and communicationsamong them can be specified in platform-independent ways.

Querying Images in the DISIMA DBMS.,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu; Paul Iglinski,Abstract Because digital images are not meaningful by themselves; images are oftencoupled with some descriptive or qualitative data in an image database. Moreover thedivision of these data into syntactic (color; shape; texture) and semantic (meaningful realword object or concept) features necessitates novel querying techniques. Most imagesystems and prototypes have focussed on similarity searches based only on the syntacticfeatures. In the DISIMA system we also propose a solution for similarity searches thatcombines color histograms; spatial relationships of image blocks and a hash structure tobetter discriminate among images. Additionally we query images on the basis of salientobjects (regions of interest in images) and their properties. This paper presents the queryingfacilities implemented for the DISIMA system.

Tamer  Oezsu; Paul Iglinski,Abstract We describe our work in developing interoperable smart and virtual catalogs forelectronic commerce which incorporate full multimedia capabilities. Smart catalogs enablequerying of their content. The underlying assumption of our work is that future catalogs thatwill be used in electronic commerce will have two characteristics:(a) they will not onlycontain text and (perhaps) images; but will contain full multimedia capabilities includingaudio and video; and (b) these catalogs will not be monolithic; consisting of storage in asingle database management system (DBMS); but will be distributed involving a number ofdifferent types of data storage systems.

Multimedia extensions to database query languages,John Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract Declarative query languages are an important feature of database managementsystems and have played an important role in their success. As database managementtechnology enters the multimedia information system domain; the availability of querylanguages for multimedia applications will be equally important. However; one commonproblem with currently existing multimedia query languages is their lack of generality. Theyare designed either for a certain medium (eg images) or special applications (eg; medical;geographical information systems). We describe general multimedia queries based on theODMG's Object Query Language (OQL) and TIGUKAT Query Language (TQL). In order tocapture the temporal and spatial relationships in multimedia data; both OQL and TQL areextended by a set of multimedia primitives. These extended OQL and TQL also include …,*,1997,6
Future of database systems: changing applications and technological developments,M Tamer Özsu,Database management systems (DBMSs) are at a crossroads; perhaps the first since theirsuccessful entry into the information-processing marketplace. On the one hand; relationalsystems have been enormously successful; creating a multibillion-dollar industry over thelast two decades. On the other; current technological developments and applicationdemands are severely testing the limits of current commercial systems. Failure to addressthese changes and demands may result in the marginalization of database managementwith more and more data stored elsewhere and managed by systems without typicaldatabase functionality (eg; querying; transactional support; integrity enforcement). Thefollowing are some of my views on the challenges and the directions that seem to beimportant to investigate.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,6
Modeling video spatial relationships in an object model,John Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract Video modeling has become a topic of increasing interest in the area of multimediaresearch. One of the key aspects in the video medium is spatial relationships. In this paperwe propose a spatial representation; based on the temporal interval algebra; for specifyingthe spatial semantics of video data. Based on such a representation; a set of comprehensivespatial relationships for salient objects are de ned in supporting qualitative and quantitativespatial properties. Further; both topological and directional spatial relationships are capturedwithin the proposed model. We present a novel way of incorporating the spatial model into avideo model; called a common video object tree; and integrating the abstract video modelinto an objectbase management system which has rich multimedia temporal operations.

A uniform behavioral temporal object model,Iqbal Goralwalla; Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract In this work we present a uniform behavioral temporal object model which includesa rich and extensible set of types and behaviors to support various notions of time. Ourtemporal model supports the continuous and discrete domains of time. It also supportsvarious speci cations of time namely; time instants; time intervals; and time spans. Twoissues which deal with temporal information that frequently arise in real-world applicationsare the need to consistently store and operate on temporal information that is comprised ofdi erent granularities; and the ability to represent indeterminate temporal information.Temporal indeterminacy arises when we know for certain that an event did occur; but exactlywhen it occured is unknown. Our model provides a uniform framework that supports di erentgranularities of time and temporal indeterminacy. We show how di erent granularities can …,*,1995,6

Join processing heuristics in relational database systems,M Tamer Özsu; David J Meechan,Abstract Due to its direct impact on the performance of relational database managementsystems (DBMS); query processing algorithms have been the subject of considerable study.Typical processing strategies involve the calculation of elaborate cost functions to find an“optimum” one. The topic of this paper is to develop optimization heuristics to complement(and sometimes replace) these elaborate cost functions with emphasis on the optimization ofjoin queries. The heuristics are identified by means of detailed simulations of a particularDBMS model under various environmental conditions. The system model is based onSystem R.,Information Systems,1990,6

XCube: Processing XPath queries in a hypercube overlay network,Yingguang Li; M Tamer Özsu; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we present the design and performance of XCube; a tag-basedsystem for managing XML data in a hypercube overlay network. In XCube; each node in ad-dimensional hypercube is identified by ad-bit vector. A peer manages a smaller hypercubewith dimension d′< d. An XML document is compactly represented as a structure summaryand a content summary. The structure summary comprises ad-bit vector derived from thedistinct tag names in the document and a synopsis capturing the structure of the document.The content summary consists of a bit map that summarizes the document content.

Indexing the Results of Sliding Window Queries,Lukasz Golab; Piyush Prahladka; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract A popular method of bounding the memory requirements of queries over datastreams is to use a sliding window; where old data are continuously removed as new dataarrive. One problem that has not been addressed previously concerns indexing the results ofsliding window queries. This is a noteworthy problem because data stream systems oftenmaterialize common sub-expressions or final results of similar queries; therefore it isimportant to allow the queries efficient access into a relevant subset of the materializedresult. In this paper; we design and evaluate indexing methods that take advantage of thetemporal order in which old answers expire for efficient maintenance and querying of theresults. Our techniques allow sharing of indexed results among similar queries; adapt tofluctuating stream arrival rates; and are experimentally shown to perform updates over …,University of Waterloo Technical Report CS-2005-10,2005,5
Foundation of the DISIMA Image Query Languages,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract Because digital images are not meaningful by themselves; images are oftencoupled with some descriptive or qualitative data in an image database. These data; dividedinto syntactic (color; shape; and texture) and semantic (meaningful real word object orconcept) features; necessitate novel querying techniques. Most image systems andprototypes have focussed on similarity searches based upon the syntactic features. In theDISIMA system; we proposed an object-oriented image data model that introduces two maintypes: image (that represents an image and its descriptive properties) and salient object (thatrepresents the semantics of an image). We further defined operations on the images and thesalient objects as new joins. This approach is necessary in order to envision a declarativequery language for images.

Indexes enable e cient access to a subset of a database. There have been manystudies on indexing within the context of relational database management systems(RDBMS). The most popular indexing techniques are based on B-trees 1]. However; theseindex structures do not apply for images in Multimedia Database Systems (MMDBS).

TIGUKAT has anovel object model whose identifying characteristics include a purely behavioral semanticsand a uniform approach to objects. Everything in the system is a first-class object with well-defined behavior. The computational model supported is one of applying behaviors toobjects. A query model has been developed for TIGUKAT that is complete with a formalobject calculus; an equivalent object algebra and an object SQL language. The uniformity ofthe model permits modeling queries as objects; opening up the possibility of developing anextensible query optimizer.

Query processing issues in object-oriented database system-preliminary ideas,M Tamer Ozsu,Object-oriented database technology is being developed to provide support for advancedapplications such as engineering databases; office information systems; and knowledgebases. Successful deployment of these systems requires the provision of full set of featuresand capabilities found in traditional data managers (eg; relational systems). An importantfeature is a declarative query language and its associated query processor. Development ofquery models and design of query processors is well understood in traditional databasemanagement systems. However; the task is complicated in object-oriented systems due tothe richness of the data model. The query models necessarily become more complex andtheir optimization significantly more difficult.

Finding heuristics for processing selection queries in relational database systems,M Tamer Özsu; David J Meechan,Abstract The traditional approaches to query processing in relational database managementsystems usually involve the evaluation of elaborate cost functions to determine the “optimal”processing strategy. In some systems; the cost of all applicable strategies are calculated andthe one with the minimum cost (usually expressed as expected time) is selected. Theevaluation of these cost functions; however; contribute adversely to the query processingperformance. This paper discusses the possibility of a different query processing technique:one based on heuristics. The heuristics are determined by investigating the conditions underwhich a particular strategy offers the best performance. These conditions are identified bymeans of detailed simulations of a particular database management system model undervarious environmental conditions.

Executing queries over schemaless RDF databases,Güneş Aluç; M Tamer Özsu; Khuzaima Daudjee; Olaf Hartig,Recent advances in Linked Data Management and the Semantic Web have led to a rapidincrease in both the quantity as well as the variety of Web applications that rely on theSPARQL interface to query RDF data. Thus; RDF data management systems areincreasingly exposed to workloads that are far more diverse and dynamic than what thesesystems were designed to handle. The problem is that existing systems rely on a workload-oblivious physical representation that has a fixed schema; which is not suitable for diverseand dynamic workloads. To address these issues; we propose a physical representation thatis schemaless. The resulting flexibility enables an RDF dataset to be clustered based purelyon the workload; which is key to achieving good performance through optimized I/O andcache utilization. Consequently; given a workload; we develop techniques to compute a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,4

Amongthe XML data management issues; storage and query processing are the most critical oneswith respect to system performance. Different storage schemes have their own pros andcons. Some storage schemes are more amenable to fast navigation; and some schemesperform better in fragment extraction and document reconstruction. Therefore; based on theirown requirements; different systems adopt different storage schemes to tradeoff one set offeatures over the others.

Hierarchical indexing approach to support XPath queries,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; M Tamer Ozsu; Kam-Fai Wong,We study new hierarchical indexing approach to process XPATH queries. Here; ahierarchical index consists of index entries that are pairs of queries and their (full/partial)answers (called extents). With such an index; XPATH queries can be processed to extractthe results if they match the queries maintained in those index entries. Existing XML pathindexing approaches support either child-axis (/) only; or additional descendant-or-self-axis(//) but only in the query root. Different from them; we propose a novel indexing approach toprocess a large fragment of XPATH queries; which may use/;//; and wildcards (*). The keyissues are how to reduce the number of index entries and how to maintain non-overlappingextents among index entries. We show how to compress such index and how to evaluateXPATH queries on it.

In thispaper; we focus on an important issue in distributed DSMS operation; namely loaddistribution to minimize end-to-end latency. We identify the often conflicting requirements ofload distribution; and propose a" potential-driven" load distribution approach to mimic themovements of objects in the physical world. Our approach also takes into accountheterogeneous machines; different network conditions; and resource constraints.

On label stream partition for efficient holistic twig join,Bo Chen; Tok Wang Ling; M Tamer Özsu; Zhenzhou Zhu,Abstract Label stream partition is a useful technique to reduce the input I/O cost of holistictwig join by pruning useless streams beforehand. The Prefix Path Stream (PPS) partitionscheme is effective for non-recursive XML documents; but inefficient for deep recursive XMLdocuments due to the high CPU cost of pruning and merging too many streams for sometwig pattern queries involving recursive tags. In this paper; we propose a general streampartition scheme called Recursive Path Stream (RPS); to control the total number of streamswhile providing pruning power. In particular; each recursive path in RPS represents a set ofprefix paths which can be recursively expanded from the recursive path. We present thealgorithms to build RPS scheme and prune RPS streams for queries. We also discuss theadaptability of RPS and provide a framework for performance tuning with general RPS …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,4

Since DISIMA is being developed on top of an object-oriented database system; we first propose a powerful object-oriented view mechanismbased on the separation between types (interface functions) and classes that manageobjects of the same type. The image view mechanism uses our object-oriented viewmechanism to allow us to give different semantics to the same image. The solution is basedon the distinction between physical salient objects which are interesting objects in an imageand logical salient objects which are the meanings of these objects.,*,1999,4

Architecturally; we classify existing approaches and systemsinto two paradigms: Multidatabase management-based paradigm and Mediator-basedinformation delivery paradigm; and analyze the techniques used in each. Technically; wedescribe a number of data delivery characteristics in terms of delivery protocols; deliverymodes; and delivery frequencies. We further use these characteristics to discuss andcompare several data delivery schemes. We argue that an advanced distributed informationsystem must incorporate different types of information delivery so that the system can beoptimized according to various criteria; such as network traffic and heterogeneity andconstant evolution of online information sources. To illustrate the architectural and …,*,1998,4
Database management support for a news-on-demand application,M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron; Ghada El-Medani; Sherine El-Medani; Paul Iglinski; Manuela Schoene; Chiradeep Vittal,We describe the type system component of a database management system that supports amultimedia news-on-demand application. The type system is an object-oriented one thatrepresents document structure according to the SGML and HyTime standards. End-usersaccess the news database by using a visual query interface. We also describe current workto generalize the database type system to accommodate arbitrary SGML/HyTime compliantmultimedia documents. Such a generalized type system would support a broad range ofmultimedia applications.,Multimedia: Full-Service Impact on Business; Education; and the Home,1996,4
A general concurrency control for database systems,Abdel A Farrag; M TAMER Ozsu,ABSTRACT The concurrency control problem in database systems has been examined bymany people and several concurrency control algorithms have been proposed. The mostpopular concurrency controls are two-phase locking and timestamp ordering. This paperreviews both algorithms and shows that they are special cases of a more generalconcurrency control algorithm. This concurrency control algorithm is described in detail andis proven to work correctly. Several other special cases of the proposed mechanism arepresented. We show that two-phase locking and timestamp ordering represent the two endpoints of a series of concurrency controls. Each of them is a special case of the generalconcurrency control described in this paper.,Proc. National Computer Conf,1985,4

Walking without a map: ranking-based traversal for querying linked data,Olaf Hartig; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The traversal-based approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWWfetches data by traversing data links and; thus; is able to make use of up-to-date data frominitially unknown data sources. While the downside of this approach is the delay before thequery engine completes a query execution; user perceived response time may be improvedsignificantly by returning as many elements of the result set as soon as possible. To this end;the query engine requires a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevantdata as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine doesnot know a priori which of the data sources discovered during the query execution willcontain result-relevant data. In this paper; we investigate 14 different approaches to ranktraversal steps and achieve a variety of traversal strategies. We experimentally study their …,International Semantic Web Conference,2016,3

An efficient eigenvalue-based P2P XML routing framework,Qiang Wang; M Tamer Ozsu,Many emerging applications that use XML are distributed; usually over large peer-to-peer(P2P) networks on the Internet. The deployment of an XML query shipping system over P2Pnetworks requires a specialized synopsis to capture XML data in routing tables. In thispaper; we propose a novel eigenvalue-based routing synopsis for deployment overunstructured P2P networks. Based on well-established Cauchy's interlacing theorem; ourapproach employs multiple eigenvalues as routing synopsis and facilitates query routingprocess with computationally-inexpensive range inequality checking. Through extensiveexperiments; we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2007. P2P 2007. Seventh IEEE International Conference on,2007,3
Views or Points of View on Images,Vincent Oria; M TAMER ÖZSU,Images like other multimedia data need to be described as it is difficult to grasp theirsemantics from the raw data. With the emergence of standards like MPEG-7; multimediadata will be increasingly produced together with some semantic descriptors. But adescription of a multimedia data is just an interpretation; a point of view on the data anddifferent interpretations can exist for the same multimedia data. In this paper we explore theuse of view techniques to define and manage different points of view on images. Views havebeen widely used in relational database management systems to extend modelingcapabilities; and to provide logical data independence. Since our image model is defined onan object-oriented model; we will first propose a powerful object-oriented mechanism basedon the distinction between class and type. The object view is used in the image view …,International Journal of Image and Graphics,2003,3

Mediator join indices,Ling Ling Yan; M Tamer Ozsu; Ling Liu,A mediator join index (MJI) is proposed to speed up N-way inter-database joins by reducingthe amount of data transfer during evaluation. A family of algorithms; the query scrubbingalgorithms (QSA); are developed to maintain MJI and to evaluate queries using MJI. QSAalgorithms use query scrubbing to cope with update and query anomalies related tomaterialized views in the mediator context. Compared with existing algorithms; QSAalgorithms incur less overhead in handling the anomalies and makes MJI a promisingtechnique for efficient mediator query processing.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1997.

Semipermeable transactions and semantics-based concurrency control for multidatabases,John Shillington; M Tamer Ozsu,The problem of concurrency control for transactions in a multidatabase system has receivedconsiderable attention. Many of the proposed solutions offer either small increases inconcurrency compared to sequential execution; or make unrealistic assumptions about theoperating environment. The authors approach the problem by combining existing solutionswhich guarantee global serializability and then use the semantics of global transactions tosignificantly increase the degree of concurrency. The idea is to specify acceptable violationsof global serializability when allowed by the semantics of global transactions. This isaccomplished by allowing global transactions to interleave globally based on thepermeability of the transactions.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1993: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1993.

ViewDF: Declarative incremental view maintenance for streaming data,Yuke Yang; Lukasz Golab; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract We present ViewDF: a flexible and declarative framework for incrementalmaintenance of materialized views (ie; results of continuous queries) over streaming data.The main component of the proposed framework is the View Delta Function (ViewDF); whichdeclaratively specifies how to update a materialized view when a new batch of data arrives.We describe and experimentally evaluate a prototype system based on this idea; whichallows users to write ViewDFs directly and automatically translates common classes ofstreaming queries into ViewDFs. Our approach generalizes existing work on incrementalview maintenance and enables new optimizations for views that are common in streamanalytics; including those with pattern matching and sliding windows.,Information Systems,2017,2
Graph-based RDF data management,Lei Zou; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract The increasing size of RDF data requires efficient systems to store and query them.There have been efforts to map RDF data to a relational representation; and a number ofsystems exist that follow this approach. We have been investigating an alternative approachof maintaining the native graph model to represent RDF data; and utilizing graph databasetechniques (such as a structure-aware index and a graph matching algorithm) to addressRDF data management. Since 2009; we have been developing a set of graph-based RDFdata management systems that follow this approach: gStore; gStore-D and gAnswer. Thefirst two are designed to support efficient SPARQL query evaluation in a centralized anddistributed/parallel environments; respectively; while the last one aims to provide an easy-to-use interface (natural language question/answering) for users to access a RDF repository …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,2

Graph search of software models using multidimensional scaling,Piero Fraternali,ABSTRACT Software models formalize the requirements; structure and behavior of a systemor application. They represent essential artifacts that simplify the process of softwaredevelopment. Software repositories have been developed to store models in order tofacilitate the reuse of know-how from software projects; however; methods for searchingthese model repositories are not very efficient. Specifically; while being more scalable;general-purpose keyword search is not suitable for model search because it does notconsider the structure that is inherent in software models: a good search algorithm shouldconsider the model structure as well as the knowledge concentrated in the metamodel. Onthe other hand; existing approaches that consider the structure while querying softwaremodels are limited to only specific domains such as Business Process Models (BPMs).

Distributed data management in 2020?,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez; Serge Abiteboul; Bettina Kemme; Ricardo Jiménez-Péris; Beng Chin Ooi,Work on distributed data management commenced shortly after the introduction of therelational model in the mid-1970's. 1970's and 1980's were very active periods for thedevelopment of distributed relational database technology; and claims were made that in thefollowing ten years centralized databases will be an “antique curiosity” and mostorganizations will move toward distributed database managers [1]. That prediction hascertainly become true; and all commercial DBMSs today are distributed.,*,2011,2
Overview of query processing,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract The success of relational database technology in data processing is due; in part; tothe availability of non-procedural languages (ie; SQL); which can significantly improveapplication development and end-user productivity. By hiding the low-level details about thephysical organization of the data; relational database languages allow the expression ofcomplex queries in a concise and simple fashion. In particular; to construct the answer to thequery; the user does not precisely specify the procedure to follow. This procedure is actuallydevised by a DBMS module; usually called a query processor. This relieves the user fromquery optimization; a time-consuming task that is best handled by the query processor; sinceit can exploit a large amount of useful information about the data.,*,2011,2
Distributed Database Design,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract The design of a distributed computer system involves making decisions on theplacement of data and programs across the sites of a computer network; as well as possiblydesigning the network itself. In the case of distributed DBMSs; the distribution of applicationsinvolves two things: the distribution of the distributed DBMS software and the distribution ofthe application programs that run on it. Different architectural models discussed in Chapter 1address the issue of application distribution. In this chapter we concentrate on distribution ofdata.,*,2011,2
Jtop algorithms for top-k join queries,Reza Akbarinia; Ihab F Ilyas; M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Top-k queries have attracted much interest in many different areas of computing such asnetwork and system monitoring [5][21]; information retrieval [4][20][22]; sensor networks[29][31]; multimedia databases [1][10][16][27]; spatial data analysis [33][19]; probabilisticdatabases [28]; data stream management systems [23][25]; etc. The main reason is that theyavoid overwhelming the user with large numbers of uninteresting answers. The two mainforms of top-k queries are top-k selection and top-k join. The seminal work by Fagin [13] ontop-k selection queries (or top-k queries for short) proposes a general model for answeringtop-k queries as follows. Suppose we have m lists of n data items such that each data itemhas a local score in each list. The lists are sorted according to the local scores of their dataitems. Each data item has an overall score; which is computed based on its local scores …,*,2008,2

Although multimedia data (text; sound; image; video andanimation) are di erent in terms of their processing; similarities exist in the ways to handlethese data.

Distributed and parallel database object management,Elisa Bertino; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract. We propose an algorithm for executing transactions in object-oriented databases.The object-oriented database model generalizes the classical model of databaseconcurrency control by permitting accesses to class and instance objects; by permittingarbitrary operations on objects as opposed to traditional read and write operations; and byallowing nested execution of transactions on objects. In this paper; we first develop auniform methodology for treating both classes and instances. We then develop a two-phaselocking protocol with a new relationship between locks caIled ordered sharing for an object-oriented database. Ordered sharing does not restrict the execution of conflicting operations.Finally; we extend the protocol to handle objects that execute methods on other objects thusresulting in the nested execution of transactions.

Reliability of transactions on multidatabase systems,Ken Barker; M Tamer Özsu,*,*,1990,2
Notes on Database System Reliability,M Tamer Ozsu,We have so far assumed that no system failures occur. Within this context; concurrencycontrol algorithms enforce the isolation property as well as database consistency. The no-failure assumption is; of course; unrealistic; there will be various failures in any computersystem. Therefore appropriate protocols have to be implemented such that DBMS reliabilitycan be guaranteed. DBMS reliability protocols address transaction atomicity and durability.As we discussed; atomicity refers to the “all-or-nothing” property of transactions.Consequently; we need to guarantee that; in the face of failures; either the effects of all of theactions of a transaction are reflected in the database; or none of the effects are. For example;if we are running a transaction that increases the salaries of employees by 10%; and afailure occurs during its execution; the DBMS has to take special care to ensure that the …,*,*,2

Peer-to-Peer Data Management,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract In this chapter; we discuss the data management issues in the “modern” peer-to-peer (P2P) data management systems. We intentionally use the phrase “modern” todifferentiate these from the early P2P systems that were common prior to client/servercomputing. As indicated in Chapter 1; early work on distributed DBMSs had primarilyfocused on P2P architectures where there was no differentiation between the functionality ofeach site in the system. So; in one sense; P2P data management is quite old–if one simplyinterprets P2P to mean that there are no identifiable “servers” and “clients” in the system.However; the “modern” P2P systems go beyond this simple characterization and differ fromthe old systems that are referred to by the same name in a number of important ways; asmentioned in Chapter 1.,*,2011,1
Parallel Database Systems,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Many data-intensive applications require support for very large databases (eg;hundreds of terabytes or petabytes). Examples of such applications are e-commerce; datawarehousing; and data mining. Very large databases are typically accessed through highnumbers of concurrent transactions (eg; performing on-line orders on an electronic store) orcomplex queries (eg; decision-support queries). The first kind of access is representative ofOn-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) applications while the second is representative ofOn-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) applications. Supporting very large databasesefficiently for either OLTP or OLAP can be addressed by combining parallel computing anddistributed database management.,*,2011,1

In this case; a number ofdatabases already exist; and the design task involves integrating them into one database.The starting point of bottom-up design is the individual local conceptual schemas. Theprocess consists of integrating local databases with their (local) schemas into a globaldatabase with its global conceptual schema (GCS)(also called the mediated schema).,*,2011,1

Caching has been a usefultechnique for reducing stress on limited resources and improving response time. In thispaper; we propose an'active caching'technique for recommender systems based on a partialorder approach that not only benefits from popularity and temporal locality; but also exploitsspatial locality. This approach allows the processing of answers to neighboring non-cachedqueries in addition to the reporting of cached query results. Test results for several data setsand recommendation techniques show substantial improvement in the cache hit ratio andcomputational costs; while achieving reasonable recall rates.,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Recommender systems,2009,1

Distributed XML Processing,M Tamer Özsu,Abstract XML is commonly used to store data and to exchange it between a variety ofsystems. While centralized querying of XML data is increasingly well understood; the sameis not true in a scenario where the data is spread across multiple nodes in a distributedsystem. Since the size of XML data collections are increasing along with the heavyworkloads that need to be evaluated on top of these collections; scaling a centralizedsolution is becoming increasingly difficult. A common method for addressing this issue is todistribute the data and parallelize query execution. This is well understood in relationaldatabases; but the issues are more complicated in the case of XML data due to thecomplexity of the data representation and the flexibility of the schema definition.

In the last few years; two diverging views haveappeared. One approach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the parameters ofthe architecture (cache sizes; TLB; and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues thatmodern hardware is good enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and;consequently; the careful tailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In thispaper we resolve this conflict through an extensive experimental analysis of the designspace using different algorithms and architectures.

G-thinker: Big Graph Mining Made Easier and Faster,Da Yan; Hongzhi Chen; James Cheng; M Tamer Özsu; Qizhen Zhang; John Lui,Abstract: This paper proposes a general system for compute-intensive graph mining tasksthat find from a big graph all subgraphs that satisfy certain requirements (eg; graph matchingand community detection). Due to the broad range of applications of such tasks; many single-threaded algorithms have been proposed. However; graphs such as online social networksand knowledge graphs often have billions of vertices and edges; which require distributedprocessing in order to scale. Unfortunately; existing distributed graph processing systemssuch as Pregel and GraphLab are designed for data-intensive analytics; and are inefficientfor compute-intensive graph mining tasks since computation over any data is coupled withthe data's access that involves network transmission. We propose a distributed graph miningframework; called G-thinker; which is designed for compute-intensive graph mining …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03110,2017,*
Do We Need Specialized Graph Databases?: Benchmarking Real-Time Social Networking Applications,Anil Pacaci; Alice Zhou; Jimmy Lin; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract With the advent of online social networks; there is an increasing demand for storageand processing of graph-structured data. Social networking applications pose newchallenges to data management systems due to demand for real-time querying andmanipulation of the graph structure. Recently; several systems specialized systems for graph-structured data have been introduced. However; whether we should abandon matureRDBMS technology for graph databases remains an ongoing discussion. In this paper wepresent an graph database benchmarking architecture built on the existing LDBC SocialNetwork Benchmark. Our proposed architecture stresses the systems with an interactivetransactional workload to better simulate the real-time nature of social networkingapplications. Using this improved architecture; we evaluated a selection of specialized …,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Graph Data-management Experiences & Systems,2017,*

It uses a mapping to a model from things in reality or from virtual things. Themodel has the truncation property; ie; it lacks some of the details in the original; and apragmatic property; ie; the model use is only justified for particular model users; tools ofinvestigation; and periods of time. Database engineering uses construction abstraction;context abstraction; and refinement abstraction. Construction abstraction is based on theprinciples of hierarchical structuring; constructor composition; and generalization.

Web Data Management in the RDF Age: Keynote talk abstract,M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Web data management has been a topic of interest for many years during which anumber of different modelling approaches have been tried. The latest in this approaches isto use RDF (Resource Description Framework); which seems to provide real opportunity forquerying at least some of the web data systematically. RDF has been proposed by the WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C) for modeling Web objects as part of developing the" semanticweb". W3C has also proposed SPARQL as the query language for accessing RDF datarepositories. The publication of Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web has gainedtremendous momentum over the last number of years; and this provides a new opportunityto accomplish web data integration. A number of approaches have been proposed forrunning SPARQL queries over RDF-encoded Web data: data warehousing; SPARQL …,Proceedings of the 20th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2016,*

ACM books to launch,M Tamer Özsu,The academic and technical publishing landscape has changed significantly over the pastdecade. Following a period of massive consolidation in the scientific; technical; and medicalpublishing industry; there are now only a handful of commercial houses publishing computerscience research; and their attention to computer science books; and in particular tograduate textbooks and research monographs where sales are modest compared to theundergraduate market; has dwindled. There are certainly exceptions; and university presseshave filled some of the gap; but in today's environment it is entirely accurate to say aconsiderable vacuum exists in scholarly computer science book publishing. As a result;ACM has decided to play a significant role in filling some of this void by launching a newbook program called ACM Books that will enhance its already rich journal and conference …,Communications of the ACM,2013,*

Answering Aggregate Queries Over Large RDF Graphs,Lei Zou; Ruizhe Huang; Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu; Dongyan Zhao,ABSTRACT In this paper; we develop a graph-based methodology for processing aggregateSPARQL queries. The recent version of SPARQL specification (SPARQL 1.1) includesaggregation queries as aa core requirement. However; few existing works and SPARQLengines consider aggregate queries. We decompose each query into a set of star aggregatequeries whose results are combined to achieve the final aggregate results. We developindex structures and processing algorithms for efficient evaluation of aggregation queries.Extensive experiments on both real and benchmark datasets confirm the efficiency of ourmethod.,*,2012,*

Universal Top-k Keyword Search over Relational Databases,Ning Zhang; Ihab F Ilyas; M Tamer Ozsu,Keyword search is one of the most effective paradigms for information discovery. One of the keyadvantages of keyword search querying is its simplicity. There is an increasing need for allowingordinary users to issue keyword queries without any knowledge of the database schema. Theretrieval unit of keyword search queries over relational databases is different than in IRsystems. While the retrieval unit in those IR systems is a document; in our case; the result is asynthesized document formed by joining a number of tuples. We measure result quality usingtwo metrics: structural quality and content quality. The content quality of a JTT is an IR-style scorethat indicates how well the information nodes match the keywords; while the structural qualityof JTT is a score that evaluates the meaningfulness/semantics of connecting informationnodes; for example; the closeness of the corresponding relationship.

Web Data Management,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract TheWorldWideWeb (“WWW” or “web” for short) has become a major repository ofdata and documents. Although measurements differ and change; the web has grown at aphenomenal rate. According to two studies in 1998; there were 200 million [Bharat andBroder; 1998] to upwards of 320 million [Lawrence and Giles; 1998] static web pages. A1999 study reported the size of the web as 800 million pages [Lawrence and Giles; 1999].By 2005; the number of pages were reported to be 11.5 billion [Gulli and Signorini; 2005].Today it is estimated that the web contains over 25 billion pages 1 and growing. These arenumbers for the “static” web pages; ie; those whose content do not change unless the pageowners make explicit changes. The size of the web is much larger when “dynamic” webpages (ie; pages whose content changes based on the context of user requests) are …,*,2011,*
Multidatabase Query Processing,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract In the previous three chapters; we have considered query processing in tighly-coupled homogeneous distributed database systems. As we discussed in Chapter 1; thesesystems are logically integrated and provide a single image of the database; even thoughthey are physically distributed. In this chapter; we concentrate on query processing inmultidatabase systems that provide interoperability among a set of DBMSs. This is only onepart of the more general interoperability problem. Distributed applications pose majorrequirements regarding the databases they access; in particular; the ability to access legacydata as well as newly developed databases. Thus; providing integrated access to multiple;distributed databases and other heterogeneous data sources has become a topic ofincreasing interest and focus.,*,2011,*
Query Decomposition and Data Localization,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract In Chapter 6 we discussed a generic layering scheme for distributed queryprocessing in which the first two layers are responsible for query decomposition and datalocalization. These two functions are applied successively to transform a calculus queryspecified on distributed relations (ie; global relations) into an algebraic query defined onrelation fragments. In this chapter we present the techniques for query decomposition anddata localization.,*,2011,*
Optimization of Distributed Queries,M Tamer Özsu; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Chapter 7 shows how a calculus query expressed on global relations can bemapped into a query on relation fragments by decomposition and data localization. Thismapping uses the global and fragment schemas. During this process; the application oftransformation rules permits the simplification of the query by eliminating commonsubexpressions and useless expressions. This type of optimization is independent offragment characteristics such as cardinalities. The query resulting from decomposition andlocalization can be executed in that form simply by adding communication primitives in asystematic way. However; the permutation of the ordering of operations within the query canprovide many equivalent strategies to execute it. Finding an “optimal” ordering of operationsfor a given query is the main role of the query optimization layer; or optimizer for short.,*,2011,*

Efficient decision tree re-alignment for clustering time-changing data streams,Yingying Tao; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Mining streaming data has been an active research area to address requirementsof applications; such as financial marketing; telecommunication; network monitoring; and soon. A popular technique for mining these continuous and fast-arriving data streams isdecision trees. The accuracy of decision trees can deteriorate if the distribution of values inthe stream changes over time. In this paper; we propose an approach based on decisiontrees that can detect distribution changes and re-align the decision tree quickly to reflect thechange. The technique exploits a set of synopses on the leaf nodes; which are also used toprune the decision tree. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach candetect the distribution changes in real-time with high accuracy; and re-aligning a decisiontree can improve its performance in clustering the subsequent data stream tuples.,*,2010,*
SIGMOD Officers; Committees; and Awardees,Advisory Board; Tamer Özsu,ABSTRACT As applications within and outside the enterprise encounter increasing volumesof unstructured data; there has been renewed interest in the area of information extraction(IE)–the discipline concerned with extracting structured information from unstructured text.Classical IE techniques developed by the NLP community were based on cascadinggrammars and regular expressions. However; due to the inherent limitations ofgrammarbased extraction; these techniques are unable to:(i) scale to large data sets; and (ii)support the expressivity requirements of complex information tasks. At the IBM AlmadenResearch Center; we are developing SystemT; an IE system that addresses these limitationsby adopting an algebraic approach.

A User Behavior Model for Web Page Navigation,S ule Gündüz; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract Making recommendation requires predicting what is of interest to a user at aspecific time. Even the same user may have different desires at different times. It is importantto extract the aggregate interest of a user from his or her navigational path through the site ina session. This paper concentrates on the discovery and modelling of the user's aggregateinterest in a session. This approach relies on the premise that the visiting time of a page isan indicator of the user's interest in that page. The proportion of times spent in a set of pagesrequested by the user within a single session forms the aggregate interest of that user in thatsession. We first partition user sessions into clusters such that only sessions which representsimilar aggregate interest of users are placed in the same cluster. We employ a model-based clustering approach and partition user sessions according to similar amount of …,*,2002,*

Flexible Data Integration on the Internet: Current Trends and Issues.,M Tamer Özsu,The emergence of the Internet as a fundamental communication medium brings newopportunities and challenges to data management. Internet-based applications require re-examination of basic assumptions about the way we manage distributed data. In this talk; wefocus on how data integration is affected by these requirements. The applications that arebuilt on the Internet do not lend themselves to static and restrictive integration architecturesthat have so far been developed. There is a need for more flexibility in the way componentsystems (data sources; applications; etc) can join and leave federated systems. There is aneed for more sophisticated algorithms for data management that can take into account thisflexibility and its consequences.

An Introduction to Relational Calculus,M Tamer Ozsu,In relational calculus-based languages; instead of specifying how to obtain the result; onespeci es what the result is by stating the relationship that is supposed to hold for the result.Relational calculus languages fall into two groups: tuple relational calculus and domainrelational calculus. The di erence between the two is in terms of the primitive variable usedin specifying the queries. We brie y review these two types of languages. Relational calculuslanguages have a solid theoretical foundation since they are based on rst-order predicatelogic as we discussed before. Semantics is given to formulas by interpreting them asassertions on the database. A relational database can be viewed as a collection of tuples ora collection of domains. Tuple relational calculus interprets a variable in a formula as a tupleof a relation; whereas domain relational calculus interprets a variable as the value of a …,*,1999,*

Query Optimization for Structured Documents Based on Knowledge on the Document Type Definition,ETH Zentrum Dolivostr; M Tamer Ozsu; Kathrin Gayer,Abstract Declarative access mechanisms for structured document collections and for semi-structured data are becoming increasingly important. In this article; using a rule-basedapproach for query optimization and applying it to such queries; we deploy knowledge onthe Document Type De nition (DTD) to formulate transformation rules for query-algebraterms. Specically; we look at rules that save navigation along paths by cutting o these pathsor by replacing them with access operations to indices; ie; materialized views on paths. Weshow for both cases that we correctly apply and completely exploit knowledge on the DTD;and we brie y discuss performance results.,*,1998,*
The Logic of Type Specifications: Typechecking Parametric and Inclusion Polymorphism,Yuri Leontiev; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract In this paper we present a type system that combines inclusion and parametricpolymorphism with behaviors (multi-methods) and precise function typing. Type declarationsallow user-definable variance specification of type parameters and user-definable subtypingbetween types of different kind. Our approach involves use of type specification logic whichtranslates type specifications into types. Types are computable values. Type computation oftypes generated by the logic results in precise function and behavior typing. As a proof ofconcept; a toy language with its syntax; semantics; and subject reduction theorem ispresented.,*,1998,*

Modeling of Moving Objects in a Video Objectbase Management System,John Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract Modeling moving objects has become a topic of increasing interest in the area ofvideo databases. Two key aspects of such modeling are object spatial and temporalrelationships. In this paper we introduce an innovative way to represent the trajectory ofsingle moving object and the relative spatio-temporal relations between multiple movingobjects. The representation supports a rich set of spatial topological and directionalrelations. It also supports both quantitative and qualitative user queries about movingobjects. Algorithms for matching trajectories and spatio-temporal relations of moving objectsare designed to facilitate query processing. These algorithms can handle both exact andsimilarity matches. We also discuss the integration of our moving object model; based on avideo model; in an object-oriented system. Some query examples are provided to further …,*,1996,*

With the introduction of commercial products; expectations are that distributeddatabase management systems (distributed DBMSs) will by and large replace centralizedones within the next decade. This tutorial provides an overwiew of the technology; reflectson its promises and comments on the remaining research issues; in addition to addressingthe following three questions: l.-What were the initial goals and promises of the distributeddatabase technology?

Type Consistency of Oueries in an Object-Oriented Database System,M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract Queries in object-oriented databases can return nonhomogeneous sets of objectswhen no type restrictions are placed on the inputs to the query. The tradition has been toforce homogeneity on the result by restrict-ing the types of the inputs. This restricts the rangeof permissible; and possibly useful; queries. We propose a type consistency theory forqueries in object-oriented databases which supports the existence of multiple types in thequery result. The technique is illustrated by developing type inference rules for an objectalge-bra. The main result is that the loss of type information associated with a queryoperation is reduced in most cases. We also show how type information is increased whenqueries are qualified by conjunctive predicates.,*,1990,*

Searching Digital Libraries,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,The initial efforts to standardize and facilitate searching of digital libraries date back to the1970s; when the development of the Z39. 50 protocol started. The Z39. 50 protocol is anANSI standard and defines how to search and retrieve items from a remote databasecatalog. The Z39. 50 protocol was widely deployed within library environments; allowingusers to perform searches to remote libraries. With the advent of the Web; libraries starteddigitizing and making contents available on the Web; and the Z39. 50 protocol started losingits importance. Many libraries made their content “searchable” through standard Web forms;allowing users to search and retrieve content using simply a Web browser. However; due tothe lack of a link structure; the contents of the libraries,*,*,*
Permeable Transactions and Semantics-Based Concurrency Control for Multidatabases,John Shillington; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract The problem of concurrency control for transactions in a multidatabase hasreceived considerable attention over the past few years. To date; proposed solutions o ereither small increases in concurrency compared to sequential execution; or make unrealisticassumptions about the operating environment. We approach the problem by combiningexisting solutions which guarantee global serializability and then use the semantics ofglobal transactions to signi cantly increase the degree of concurrency. The idea is to specifyacceptable violations of global serializability when allowed by the semantics of globaltransactions. This is accomplished by allowing global transactions to interleave globallybased on what we call the permeability of the transactions.,*,*,*
Side-Effect-Free View Updates,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,A view is an un-instantiated relation. The contents of its instance depend on the view queryand the instances of the base tables. For that reason; an update issued on the view cannotbe directly applied on the view instance. Instead; it has to be translated into a series ofupdates on the base tables so that when the view query is applied again on the modifiedbase table instances; the result of the view update command will be observed on the viewinstance. Unfortunately; it is not always possible to find an update translation such that thechange observed on the view instance is the one and only the one specified by the viewupdate command. When this happens for a view update translation; the translation is said tohave no side-effects. To fully exploit the updateability power of views; it is desired to be ableto find update translations that have no side-effects.,*,*,*

MANET Databases,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) database is a database that is stored in the peers of aMANET. The network is composed by a finite set of mobile peers that communicate witheach other via short range wireless protocols; such as IEEE 802.11; Bluetooth; Zigbee; orUltra Wide Band (UWB). These protocols provide broadband (typically tens of Mbps) butshort-range (typically 10–100 m) wireless communication. On each mobile peer there is alocal database that stores and manages a collection of data items; or reports. A report is aset of values sensed or entered by the user at a particular time; or otherwise obtained by amobile peer. Often a report describes a physical resource such as an available parking slot.All the local databases maintained by the mobile peers form the MANET database. Thepeers communicate reports and queries to neighbors directly; and the reports and queries …,*,*,*
Mobile Database,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,Due to device limitations; a mobile database is often much smaller than its counterpartresiding on servers and mainframes. A mobile database is managed by a DatabaseManagement System (DBMS). Again; due to resource constraints; such a system often haslimited functionality compared to a full blown database management system. For example;mobile databases are single user systems; and therefore a concurrency control mechanismis not required. Other DBMS components such as query processing and recovery may alsobe limited. Queries to the mobile database are usually posed by the user of the mobiledevice. Updates of the database may originate from the user; or from a central server; ordirectly from other mobile devices. Updates from the server are communicated wirelessly.Such communication takes place either via a point-to-point connection between the …,*,*,*

Recommendation Models for User Accesses to Web Pages,S ule Gündüz; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract. Predicting the next request of a user as she visits Web pages has gainedimportance as Web-based activity increases. There are a number of different approaches toprediction. Markov models and their variations; collaborative filtering models; or modelsbased on pattern recognition techniques such as sequence mining; association rule mining;clustering users or user sessions have been found well suited to this problem. In this paperwe review various proposed techniques and also summarize two new models that we havedeveloped. They consider the user access patterns to the pages as well as the time spent onthese pages. We report experimental studies that show that the proposed methods canachieve a better accuracy than the other approaches.,*,*,*
Efficient Maintenance of Effective NPC Teams in Massively Multiplayer Online Games by Character Binding,Yueguo Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Ozsu; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract—Managing the behavior of a huge number of non-player characters (NPCs) is amajor challenge in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) for a few reasons. First;the moving characters are highly dynamic and their positioning is highly skewed in swarmregions. Second; players are more intelligent and they often collaborate as teams. Third; thecharacters are complex by design as they can be armed with different weapons and armors;possess different capabilities; and switch from one role to another. Decision making on thebehavior of NPCs in swarm regions is therefore complex because of the rich gamesemantics in these regions. NPCs in MMOGs are also required to act in teams so that theycan fight against teamed player characters (PCs) effectively. This leads to the problems ofdynamically managing team members and effectively analyzing information of the local …,*,*,*

14 DEFINING VIEWS IN AN IMAGE DATABASE SYSTEM,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract: A view mechanism can help handle the complex semantics in emergingapplication areas such as image databases. This paper presents the view mechanism we dened for the DISIMA image database system. Since DISIMA is being developed on top of anobject-oriented database system; we rst propose a powerful object-oriented viewmechanism based on the separation between types (interface functions) and classes thatmanage objects of the same type. The image view mechanism uses our object-oriented viewmechanism to allow us to give di erent semantics to the same image. The solution is basedon the distinction between physical salient objects which are interesting objects in an imageand logical salient objects which are the meanings of these objects.,*,*,*
A User Interest Model for Web Page Navigation,S ule Gündüz; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract. Making recommendation requires predicting what is of interest to a user at aspecific time. Even the same user may have different desires at different times. It is importantto extract the aggregate interest of a user from his or her navigational path through the site ina session. This paper concentrates on the discovery and modelling of the user's aggregateinterest in a session. This approach relies on the premise that the visiting time of a page isan indicator of the user's interest in that page. The proportion of times spent in a set of pagesrequested by the user within a single session forms the aggregate interest of that user in thatsession. We first partition user sessions into clusters such that only sessions which representsimilar aggregate interest of users are placed in the same cluster. We employ a model-based clustering approach and partition user sessions according to similar amount of …,*,*,*

Type System of an Object-Oriented Database Programming,Y Leontiev; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron,Abstract In this paper we present the type system of the TIGUKAT database programminglanguage. It is a highly parametric object-oriented type system that combines multipledispatch with re exivity; separation of interface and implementation; precise behavior typing;and union and intersection types. We demonstrate the inner workings of the type system byconsidering a concrete example of type speci cation in TIGUKAT. We also review typesystems of several existing programming languages and conclude that the proposed typesystem has a unique combination of features particularly suited for object-oriented databaseprogramming.,*,*,*

Efficient processing of XPath expressions is an integral part of XML data queryprocessing. Exploiting materialized views in query processing can significantly enhancequery processing performance. We propose a novel view definition that allows forintermediate (structural) join results to be stored and reused in XML query evaluation. Unlikecurrent XML view proposals; our views do not require navigation in the original document orpath-based pattern matching. Hence; they can be evaluated significantly faster and can bemore easily costed as part of a query plan. In general; current structural joins cannot exploitviews efficiently when the view definition is not a prefix (or a suffix) of the XPath query. Toincrease the applicability of our proposed view definition; we propose a novel physicalstructural join operator called InterJoin. The InterJoin operator allows for joining …,*,*,*
Object-Oriented Modeling of Multimedia Documents for a News-on-Demand Application,Chiradeep Vittal; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron; G El Medani,Abstract We describe the design of a multimedia database for a distributed news-ondemandmultimedia information system. News–on–demand is an application that utilizes broadbandnetwork services to deliver news articles to subscribers in the form of multimedia documents.Different news providers insert articles into the database; which are then accessed byremote users over a broadband ATM network. The particulars of our design are an object-oriented approach and strict adherence to international standards; in particular SGML andHyTime. We also briefly describe a visual querying facility that we have developed for thisdatabase.,*,*,*
THE PUSH/PULL EFFECT,M Tamer Özsu,In 1992; Database Programming & Design published an article written by Patrick Valduriezand myself entitled “Distributed Database Systems: Where Are We Now?”[1]. This article–which was written as a prologue to our then-recently published book on distributed databasetechnology–took stock of where the commercial state-of-the-art was at the time and identifiedsome major unresolved issues.,*,*,*
Efficient Index-based Processing of Join Queries in DHTs,Qiang Wang; Reza Akbarinia; M Tamer Özsu,ABSTRACT Massively distributed applications require the integration of heterogeneous datafrom multiple sources. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is one possible network model for thesedistributed applications and among P2P architectures; distributed hash table (DHT) is wellknown for its routing performance guarantees. Under a general distributed relational datamodel; join query operator; an essential component to integrate data from multiple relationaltables in centralized DBMS; can be realized over DHT to support data integration tasks inP2P networks. In this paper; we propose an efficient and adaptive index-based join queryoperator over DHTs. With attribute-value storage approach; we build decentralized joinindices over DHT; facilitating join query processing with reduced bandwidth consumption.Join index information regarding each join query operator is maintained across multiple …,*,*,*

Ralf Hartmut Güting,LING LIU; M TAMER ÖZSU,When operations are included; a trajectory corresponds to a value of a moving point datatype. Queries on databases containing trajectories can be formulated using moving objectlanguages. When uncertainty about an object's precise position is taken into account; an uncertaintrajectory [ 3 ] results which can be viewed as a kind of cylindrical volume in the 2D + timespace. There exists a lot of work on indexing trajectories [ 2 ]. Querying for trajectories similarto a given one is also an important research area [ 1 ] … Chen L.; Özsu MT; and Oria V.
