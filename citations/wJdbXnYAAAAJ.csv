Using WordNet to turn a folksonomy into a hierarchy of concepts,David Laniado; Davide Eynard; Marco Colombetti,Abstract. As the volume of information in the read-write Web increases rapidly; folksonomiesare becoming a widely used tool to organize and categorize resources in a bottom up; flatand inclusive way. However; due to their very structure; they show some drawbacks; inparticular the lack of hierarchy bears some limitations in the possibilities of searching andbrowsing. In this paper we investigate a new approach; based on the idea of integrating anontology in the navigation interface of a folksonomy; and we describe an application thatfilters del. icio. us keywords through the WordNet hierarchy of concepts; to enrich thepossibilities of navigation.,Semantic Web Application and Perspectives-Fourth Italian Semantic Web Workshop,2007,88
Normative multi-agent systems,Giulia Andrighetto; Guido Governatori; Pablo Noriega; Leendert WN van der Torre,As research in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has been expanding its focus from from theindividual; cognitive focussed; agent models to models of socially situated agents; MASresearchers have been showing rising interest in social theories. Particular attention hasbeen given to normative concepts because it is expected that norms could play as key a rolein articulating agent interactions as the one norms play in human social intelligence. Thus;the label of “normative multi-agent system” has been attached to systems where individualand collective behaviour is affected by norms. This book is not a state of the art of normativemulti-agent systems; nor a systematic description of the key concepts; or a compendium ofthe most salient challenges. However; the reader will find in its chapters something of eachof these three contents because Normative Multi-Agent Systems is an effort to clarify the …,*,2013,80
A semantic tool to support navigation in a folksonomy,David Laniado; Davide Eynard; Marco Colombetti,Abstract We propose a new approach to integrate the navigation interface of a folksonomyadding explicit semantics provided by an ontology. We describe a tool that uses WordNet tobuild a semantic hierarchy of related tags that helps users find related resources in del. icio.us. In this way it is possible to combine the advantages of the traditional approach toclassification with the ones of the collaborative paradigm that is emerging on the Web;dealing with some of the main limitations to which folksonomies are prone.,Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on Hypertext and hypermedia,2007,29
Multimodal diffusion geometry by joint diagonalization of Laplacians,Davide Eynard; Klaus Glashoff; Michael M Bronstein; Alexander M Bronstein,Abstract: We construct an extension of diffusion geometry to multiple modalities through jointapproximate diagonalization of Laplacian matrices. This naturally extends classical dataanalysis tools based on spectral geometry; such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering.We provide several synthetic and real examples of manifold learning; retrieval; andclustering demonstrating that the joint diffusion geometry frequently better captures theinherent structure of multi-modal data. We also show that many previous attempts toconstruct multimodal spectral clustering can be seen as particular cases of joint approximatediagonalization of the Laplacians.

An integrated approach to discover tag semantics,Antonina Dattolo; Davide Eynard; Luca Mazzola,Abstract Tag-based systems have become very common for online classification thanks totheir intrinsic advantages such as self-organization and rapid evolution. However; they arestill affected by some issues that limit their utility; mainly due to the inherent ambiguity in thesemantics of tags. Synonyms; homonyms; and polysemous words; while not harmful for thecasual user; strongly affect the quality of search results and the performances of tag-basedrecommendation systems. In this paper we rely on the concept of tag relatedness in order tostudy small groups of similar tags and detect relationships between them. This approach isgrounded on a model that builds upon an edge-colored multigraph of users; tags; andresources. To put our thoughts in practice; we present a modular and extensible frameworkof analysis for discovering synonyms; homonyms and hierarchical relationships amongst …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM symposium on applied computing,2011,28

Harvesting online contents: An analysis of hotel reviews websites,Elena Marchiori; Davide Eynard; Alessandro Inversini; Lorenzo Cantoni; Francesco Cerretti,Abstract Hotel Reviews Web sites (HRWs) are the most used online sources to evaluateaccommodation alternatives. However; they often present an overwhelming amount ofunstructured or only semi-structured information which is not shared between all the systemsand which cannot be easily analyzed in an automatic way. This study aims to automaticallyanalyse hotel evaluations for a given number of Swiss hotels by comparing hotel reviews.Furthermore; the consistency of users' countries of origin in their evaluations has beenstudied. The results show that there is an overall agreement on considered HRWs and ageneral consistency among reviewers with different countries of origin.,ENTER,2011,15
Laplacian colormaps: a framework for structure‐preserving color transformations,Davide Eynard; Artiom Kovnatsky; M M Bronstein,Abstract Mappings between color spaces are ubiquitous in image processing problems suchas gamut mapping; decolorization; and image optimization for color-blind people. Simplecolor transformations often result in information loss and ambiguities; and one wishes to findan image-specific transformation that would preserve as much as possible the structure ofthe original image in the target color space. In this paper; we propose Laplacian colormaps;a generic framework for structure-preserving color transformations between images. We usethe image Laplacian to capture the structural information; and show that if the colortransformation between two images preserves the structure; the respective Laplacians havesimilar eigenvectors; or in other words; are approximately jointly diagonalizable.

Exploiting tag similarities to discover synonyms and homonyms in folksonomies,Davide Eynard; Luca Mazzola; Antonina Dattolo,SUMMARY Tag-based systems are widely available; thanks to their intrinsic advantages;such as self-organization; currency; and ease of use. Although they represent a precioussource of semantic metadata; their utility is still limited. The inherent lexical ambiguities oftags strongly affect the extraction of structured knowledge and the quality of tag-basedrecommendation systems. In this paper; we propose a methodology for the analysis of tag-based systems; addressing tag synonymy and homonymy at the same time in a holisticapproach: in more detail; we exploit a tripartite graph to reduce the problem of synonymsand homonyms; we apply a customized version of Tag Context Similarity to detect them;overcoming the limitations of current similarity metrics; finally; we propose the application ofan overlapping clustering algorithm to detect contexts and homonymies; then evaluate its …,Software: Practice and Experience,2013,11

The service computing paradigmhas so far been neutral to the specific features of search applications and services. Toaddress this weakness; search computing advocates a new approach in which search; join;and ranking are the central aspects for service composition.,IEEE Internet Computing,2010,9

Coupled functional maps,Davide Eynard; Emanuele Rodola; Klaus Glashoff; Michael M Bronstein,Classical formulations of the shape matching problem involve the definition of a matchingcost that directly depends on the action of the desired map when applied to some input data.Such formulations are typically one-sided–they seek for a mapping from one shape to theother; but not vice versa. In this paper we consider an unbiased formulation of this problem;in which we solve simultaneously for a low-distortion map relating the two given shapes andits inverse. We phrase the problem in the spectral domain using the language of functionalmaps; resulting in an especially compact and efficient optimization problem. The benefits ofour proposed regularization are especially evident in the scarce data setting; where wedemonstrate highly competitive results with respect to the state of the art.,3D Vision (3DV); 2016 Fourth International Conference on,2016,5

Normative multi-agent systems,Giulia Andrighetto; Guido Governatori; Pablo Noriega; Leon van der Torre,Abstract:[en] Normative systems are systems in the behavior of which norms play a role andwhich need normative concepts in order to be described or specified. A normative multi-agent system combines models for normative systems (dealing for example with obligations;permissions and prohibitions) with models for multi-agent systems. Norms have beenproposed in multi-agent systems and computer science to deal with issues of coordination;security; electronic commerce and institutions; agent organization. However; due to the lackof a unified theory; many multi-agent system researchers are presently developing their ownad hoc concepts and applications. The aim of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to formulate acollective appraisal of the current perspectives in the field and the most promising venues forfuture activity. In particular; the seminar has been conceived for the writing of a volume …,Dagstuhl Reports,2012,4
Using semantics and user participation to customize personalization,Davide Eynard,Abstract. Personalization and customization are two techniques that allow systems toprovide users an experience which is tailored to their preferences. Looking at the hugesuccess many customization tools had; not just on a particular set of expert users but also onthe wide Internet public; we decided to make personalization customizable; that is to allowusers access their own personal profile and build custom applications that exploit it. To dothis; we chose a specific use case: the information that users leave when they use theirbrowsers; that is the history of the visited websites and the collection of their bookmarks. Wethen converted this information from the proprietary format used by Firefox 3 in an open;RDF-based format. We built tools to do the conversion offline or in realtime and a browserextension that uses these data to provide new; potentially interesting; information.

Harvesting User-Generated Picture Metadata to Understand Destination Similarity,Alessandro Inversini; Davide Eynard,Pictures about tourism destinations are part of the contents shared online through socialmedia by travelers. User-generated pictures shared in social networks carry additionalinformation such as geotags and user descriptions of places that can be used to identifygroups of similar destinations. This article investigates the possibility of defining destinationsimilarities relying on implicit information already shared on the Web. Additionally; thepossibility of recommending one city on the basis of a given set of pictures is explored.Flickr. com was used as a case study as it represents the most popular picture sharingwebsite. The results indicate that it is possible to group similar destinations according topicture-related information; and recommending destinations without requiring users' profilesor sets of explicit preferences.,Information Technology & Tourism,2011,3

Finding similar destinations with Flickr geotags,Davide Eynard; Alessandro Inversini; Leonardo Gentile,Abstract The amount of geo-referenced information on the Web is increasing thanks to thelarge availability of location-aware mobile devices and map interfaces. In particular; in photocollections like Flickr the coexistence of geographic meta-data and text-based annotations(tags) can be exploited to infer new; useful information. This paper introduces a novelmethod to generate place profiles as vectors of user-provided tags from Flickr geo-referenced photos. These profiles can then be used to measure place similarity in terms ofthe distance between their matching vectors. A Web-based prototype has been implementedand used to analyze two distinct Flickr datasets; related to a chosen set of top tourismdestinations. The system has been evaluated by real users with an online survey. Resultsshow that our method is suitable to define similar destinations.

This approach relies on the statistical model ofCorrespondence Analysis to analyze term occurrences in text; identify the main concepts itrefers to; and retrieve semantic relationships between them. We present a tool which is ableto apply different methods for the generation of ontologies from text; namely hierarchygeneration from hierarchical clustering representation; search for Hearst Patterns on theWeb; and bootstrapping. Our evaluation shows that the precision in the generation ofhierarchies of the tool is attested to be around 60% for the best automatic approach andaround 90% for the best human-assisted approach.,KEOD,2010,*
