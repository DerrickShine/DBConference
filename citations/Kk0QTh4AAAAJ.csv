A novel two-stage identification of unstable systems,Mohamad T. Shahab; Rajamani Doraiswami,Issues in identification of unstable plant operating in a closed loop configuration areanalyzed. It is shown that the unstable poles of the plant can be identified from the zeros ofthe input sensitivity function (transfer function relating the reference input to the plant input).A two-stage MIMO subspace identification scheme is proposed to identify the plant and theinput sensitivity function. In the first stage; the input sensitivity function is identified using thereference input as the input; and the plant output and the plant input as outputs. In thesecond stage; the plant is identified using the input as the estimated plant input; the outputthe estimated plant output; where the estimates are obtained from the first stage. Theproposed scheme is evaluated on a both simulated as well as on a physical laboratory scalemagnetic levitation system.,Control and Automation; 2009. ICCA 2009.

Energy-Efficient Motion Control of Mobile Robots,Mohamad T. Shahab,With great advancements in applications of Mobile Robots; concerns of energy grew. Most of(not all) research and work done on the field of robotics is developed with no relation to„life‟ of the robot. Specifically; mobile robots use batteries to power themselves. So; the„lifespan‟ of these robots is limited. So; Investigations on energy-related concepts are alsoof great importance. Motion control and planning of robot have; of course; relation to energyconsumption. This report will shed the light on the concept Energy Efficiency in MobileRobots. Also; a somehow detailed review of related work in literature is also shown.Focused study will also be done for specific work of Mei [2]. The report will start byintroducing the concept of energy efficiency in general with relation to mobile robots insection II. Then; section III will discuss different classifications of energy consumption in …,*,2009,5
Identification of a class of unstable processes,Mohamad T. Shahab; Rajamani Doraiswami,Identification of a practical process; especially if unstable; is challenging as its model isgenerally stochastic and nonlinear. In this work we consider a class of unstable processeswhere the model is identified in a closed-loop operating regime. Important issues inidentification are addressed; namely: identification scheme; the closed loop identification ofunstable plants; choice of sampling period; and constraints on the estimated modelparameters. Further the structure of the identified model may not be identical to that of thephysical system due to noise artifacts; and inability to capture faster dynamics. Generallyleast-squares identification is employed to estimate the parameters of the system wherein allthe coefficients of numerator and the denominator coefficients of system transfer function areestimated. In many practical system there are constraints on the model parameters. The …,GCC Conference & Exhibition; 2009 5th IEEE,2009,3
New Data-Driven Method for Predicting Formation Permeability Using Conventional Well Logs and Limited Core Data,Mohamad Shahab; Guodong Jin; Ardiansyah Negara; Gaurav Agrawal,Abstract The need for improved data accuracy; cost effectiveness and delivery time to assistin decision making has gained importance in reservoir characterization and evaluation. Thispaper presents a robust and inexpensive data-driven method for predicting the formationpermeability profile from conventional well logs (CWLs) using the support vector regression(SVR) technique with limited core measurements. The method's feasibility and applicabilityare demonstrated on one field data set from a North Sea well contained a complete suite oflogs and extensive core measurements.,SPE Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Annual Technical Symposium and Exhibition,2016,1
Time-Energy Optimal Control of a Mobile Robot Using Direct Numerical Method,Mohamad T. Shahab; Amar Khoukhi; Fouad M. Al-Sunni,Abstract: Optimal control of a mobile robot system is formulated. Multiobjective criteria of timeand energy is employed. The optimal control problem is formulated as a nonlinearprogramming problem (NLP). The problem is solved using the direct method of numericaloptimal control. This setting showed great flexibility in incorporating different informationrelating to the problem; namely physical constraints and nonlinear dynamics of the system.System inputs are considered as optimization variables; along with sampling periods of theapplied inputs being optimization variables as well. Different scenarios on objectives of theproblem are implemented and investigated. Interesting results are found in terms ofcomplying with the expected behavior of a mobile robot system.

Fault Diagnosis: a Dempster-Shafer Theory Approach,Mohamad T. Shahab,Here in this report; a relatively new concept is introduced; namely; the Dempster-ShaferTheory of Evidence. This theory will be projected to a Fault Diagnosis application. Thistheory utilizes the concept of sensor (data) fusion. We can define sensor fusion as thecombining of sensory data (or data derived from sensory data) from disparate sources suchthat the resulting information is‟ better‟ than would be possible when these sources wereused individually. There is no single sensor that can constantly obtain all the informationrequired for fault diagnosis. As the development of sensor technology and signal processingmethods progresses; more information can be obtained. In section II; a detailed study will begiven for the Dempster-Shafer Theory and in section III will briefly be about fault diagnosis.Section IV will give some literature survey of related work on Dempster-Shafer Theory …,*,2009,1

Robot Self-Localization in a Known Environment,Ahmad Salam AlRefai; Mohamad T. Shahab,Here in this report; the Robot Self-Localization problem is investigated. This report willdiscuss several techniques in the literature to solve the localization problem. With the area ofAutonomous Robotics is rapidly growing; the need of more efficient motion planning isincreasing. This can not be established unless a robot can knows its own location in theenvironment. For a human; localization is easy with high processing quality of the visualinformation from the eyes. However; robots need more power to localize in the mostaccurate way. Here; we discuss how a robot can estimate its location automatically in knownenvironment. Specifically; the standard example investigated here is the RoboCupcompetition environment. The report will begin by giving some definition about thelocalization problem. Brief familiarization of the RoboCup competition is also presented …,*,2008,*
