Memory traits of innate immunity have been reported in plants and invertebrates; aswell as in mice lacking functional T and B cells that are protected against secondaryinfections after exposure to certain infections or vaccinations. The underlying mechanism oftrained immunity is represented by epigenetic programming through histone modifications;leading to stronger gene transcription upon restimulation.

Th17responses induced by Candida albicans hyphae are central for the activation of mucosalantifungal immunity. An essential step for the discrimination between yeasts and hyphaeand induction of Th17 responses is the activation of the inflammasome by C. albicanshyphae and the subsequent release of active IL-1β in macrophages. Inflammasomeactivation in macrophages results from differences in cell-wall architecture between yeastsand hyphae and is partly mediated by the dectin-1/Syk pathway. These results define thedectin-1/inflammasome pathway as the mechanism that enables the host immune system tomount a protective Th17 response and distinguish between colonization and tissue …,Journal of leukocyte biology,2011,137

We demonstrate that TLR10 is a modulatoryreceptor with mainly inhibitory effects. Blocking TLR10 by antagonistic antibodies enhancedproinflammatory cytokine production; including IL-1β; specifically after exposure to TLR2ligands. Blocking TLR10 after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells withpam3CSK4 (Pam3Cys) led to production of 2;065±106 pg/mL IL-1β (mean±SEM) incomparison with 1;043±51 pg/mL IL-1β after addition of nonspecific IgG antibodies.

Anti‐Aspergillus human host defence relies on type 1 T helper (Th1); rather than type 17 T helper (Th17); cellular immunity,Louis YA Chai; Frank Van De Veerdonk; Renoud J Marijnissen; Shih‐Chin Cheng; Ai Leng Khoo; Magda Hectors; Katrien Lagrou; Alieke G Vonk; Johan Maertens; Leo AB Joosten; Bart‐Jan Kullberg; Mihai G Netea,Summary Both interferon-γ-producing type 1 T helper (Th1)-and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells have been proposed to be involved in anti-fungal host defence.Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections; little isknown regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathwaysfor the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclearcells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes; wefound that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavagefluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly; live A. fumigatusreduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through …,Immunology,2010,98
Innate immune memory: towards a better understanding of host defense mechanisms,Jessica Quintin; Shih-Chin Cheng; Jos WM van der Meer; Mihai G Netea,Innate immunity is classically defined as unable to build up immunological memory.Recently however; the assumption of the lack of immunological memory within innateimmune responses has been reconsidered. Plants and invertebrates lacking adaptiveimmune system can be protected against secondary infections. It has been shown thatmammals can build cross-protection to secondary infections independently of T-lymphocytesand B-lymphocytes. Moreover; recent studies have demonstrated that innate immune cellssuch as NK cells and monocytes can display adaptive characteristics; a novel concept forwhich the term trained immunity has been proposed. Several mechanisms are involved inmediating innate immune memory; among which epigenetic histone modifications andmodulation of recognition receptors on the surface of innate immune cells are likely to …,*,2014,96

However; human antifungal immunity remains poorly defined. Hereby integrating transcriptional analysis and functional genomics; we identified Candida-specific host defence mechanisms in humans. Candida induced significant expression ofgenes from the type I interferon pathway in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thisunexpectedly prominent role of type I interferon pathway in anti-Candida host defence wassupported by additional evidence. Polymorphisms in type I interferon genes modulatedCandida-induced cytokine production and were correlated with susceptibility to systemiccandidiasis. In in vitro experiments; type I interferons skewed Candida-induced inflammationfrom a Th17 response towards a Th1 response. Patients with chronic mucocutaneous …,Nature communications,2013,84
Candida albicans dampens host defense by downregulating IL-17 production,Shih-Chin Cheng; Frank van de Veerdonk; Sanne Smeekens; Leo AB Joosten; Jos WM van der Meer; Bart-Jan Kullberg; Mihai G Netea,IL-17 is one of the key cytokines that stimulate host defense during a Candida infection.Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of Candida albicans to induce a Th17response. Surprisingly; experiments employing live C. ablicans demonstrated a specificdownregulation of host IL-17 secretion in human blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Byavoiding the direct contact of live C. albicans and PBMCs; we demonstrate that this inhibitioneffect is mediated by a soluble factor released by live C. albicans. However; this effect is dueneither to the releasing of C. albicans pathogen-associated molecular patterns nor to thealteration of different Th cell subtypes. Rather; we found that live C. albicans shiftstryptophan metabolism by inhibiting IDO expression away from kynurenines and toward 5-hydroxytryptophan metabolites. In addition; we show that these latter 5-hydroxytryptophan …,The Journal of Immunology,2010,72

Results: C. albicans hyphae possess glucan structures that areunique to the hyphae and are not found in yeast. Conclusion: Hyphal glucan elicits robustimmune responses. Significance: These data provide a structural basis for differentialimmune recognition of C. albicans yeast versus hyphae. Abstract The innate immune systemdifferentially recognizes Candida albicans yeast and hyphae. It is not clear how the innateimmune system effectively discriminates between yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans.Glucans are major components of the fungal cell wall and key fungal pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns.

Atlater stages in some patients; immunoparalysis may be encountered; which is associatedwith a poor outcome. By transcriptional and metabolic profiling of human patients withsepsis; we found that a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis was animportant component of initial activation of host defense. Blocking metabolic pathways withmetformin diminished cytokine production and increased mortality in systemic fungalinfection in mice. In contrast; in leukocytes rendered tolerant by exposure tolipopolysaccharide or after isolation from patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis; ageneralized metabolic defect at the level of both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism wasapparent; which was restored after recovery of the patients.

Growth of Candida albicans cells on the physiologically relevant carbon source lactate affects their recognition and phagocytosis by immune cells,Iuliana V Ene; Shih-Chin Cheng; Mihai G Netea; Alistair JP Brown,ABSTRACT Candida albicans is a normal resident of the human gastrointestinal andurogenital tracts and also a prevalent fungal pathogen. During both commensalism andinfection; it must match the immunological defenses of its host while adapting toenvironmental cues and the local nutrient status. C. albicans regularly colonizes glucose-poor niches; thereby depending upon alternative carbon sources for growth. However; moststudies of host immune responses to C. albicans have been performed on fungal cellsgrown on glucose; and the extent to which alternative physiologically relevant carbonsources impact innate immune responses has not been studied. The fungal cell wall isdecorated with multifarious pathogen-associated molecular patterns and is the main targetfor recognition by host innate immune cells.

Our studies indicatethat the immune modulating properties of many herbal drugs; for instance; the medicinalfungus Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and Cordyceps sinensis; could be attributed to theirpolysaccharide components. These polysaccharides specifically interact with and activatesurface receptors involved in innate immunity. However; due to the complexity ofpolysaccharides and their various sources from medicinal fungi; quantitative analysis ofmedicinal polysaccharide extracts with regard to their functions represents a majorchallenge.

Through network-level integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data; weidentify glycolysis; glutaminolysis; and the cholesterol synthesis pathway as indispensablefor the induction of trained immunity by β-glucan in monocytes. Accumulation of fumarate;due to glutamine replenishment of the TCA cycle; integrates immune and metabolic circuitsto induce monocyte epigenetic reprogramming by inhibiting KDM5 histone demethylases.Furthermore; fumarate itself induced an epigenetic program similar to β-glucan-inducedtrained immunity.

Complement plays a central role in Candida albicans‐induced cytokine production by human PBMCs,Shih‐Chin Cheng; Tom Sprong; Leo AB Joosten; Jos WM van der Meer; Bart‐Jan Kullberg; Bernhard Hube; Lone Schejbel; Peter Garred; Marcel van Deuren; Mihai G Netea,Abstract In experimental studies; the role of complement in antifungal host defense has beenattributed to its opsonizing capability. In this study; we report that in humans an activatedcomplement system mainly augments Candida albicans-induced host proinflammatorycytokine production via C5a-C5aR signaling; while phagocytosis and intracellular killing ofCandida are not influenced. By blocking the C5a-C5aR signaling pathway; either with anti-C5a antagonist antibodies or with the C5aR antagonist W-54001; C. albicans-induced IL-6and IL-1β levels were significantly reduced. Recombinant C5a augmented cytokineproduction. In addition; using serum from patients with various complement deficiencies; wedemonstrated a crucial role of C5; but not C6 or the membrane attack complex; in C.albicans-induced IL-6 and IL-1β production in monocytes.

Identification of host genetic factors that confer susceptibility tocandidaemia may aid in designing adjunctive immunotherapeutic strategies. Here wehypothesize that variation in immune genes may predispose to candidaemia.

Cellular bioenergetics functions not only as a power plantto fuel up the cells; but the intermediate metabolites are shown to play an important role tomodulate cellular responses. It is especially the pathways through which a cell metabolizesglucose that have been recently shown to influence both innate and adaptive immuneresponses; with oxidative phosphorylation used by resting or tolerant cells; while aerobicglycolysis (also termed 'Warburg effect') fueling activated cells.

In this study; we presentcomplementary evidence based on transcriptome analysis; genetics; and immunologicalstudies in knockout mice and humans that the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptor MDA5 (IFIH1) hasan important role in the host defense against C. albicans. Firstly; IFIH1 expression inmacrophages is specifically induced by invasive C. albicans hyphae; and patients sufferingfrom chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) express lower levels of MDA5 than healthycontrols.

Much less is known about theinduction of immune modulatory cytokines; such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) thatis the main natural antagonist of IL-1; by C. albicans. Methods Peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy individuals were stimulated with C. albicans anddifferent components of the fungal cell wall. The role of pathogen recognition receptors(PRRs) for the induction of IL-1β and IL-1Ra was investigated by using specific blockers orin PBMC from Dectin-1 deficient patients.

Here; we used a rare CARD9 variant that confers protection againstinflammatory bowel disease as an entry point to investigating CARD9 regulation. Weshowed that the protective variant of CARD9; which is C-terminally truncated; acted in adominant-negative manner for CARD9-mediated cytokine production; indicating animportant role for the C terminus in CARD9 signaling. We identified TRIM62 as a CARD9binding partner and showed that TRIM62 facilitated K27-linked poly-ubiquitination ofCARD9.

Candida albicans releases soluble factors that potentiate cytokine production by human cells through a protease-activated receptor 1-and 2-independent pathway,Shih-Chin Cheng; Louis YA Chai; Leo AB Joosten; Anna Vecchiarelli; Bernhard Hube; Jos W Van Der Meer; Bart Jan Kullberg; Mihai G Netea,ABSTRACT The innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns(PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and transduces downstream signalingto activate the host defense. Here we report that in addition to direct PAMP-PRR interactions;live Candida albicans cells can release soluble factors to actively potentiate interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 production induced in human mononuclear cells by the fungi. Although protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and PAR2 ligation can moderately upregulate Toll-like receptor4 (TLR4)-mediated IL-8 production; no effect on the C. albicans-induced cytokine wasapparent. Similarly; the blockade of PAR signaling did not reverse the potentiation ofcytokine production induced by soluble factors released by C. albicans.

Living as a commensal; Saccharomycescerevisiae could potentially shape the immune response in a significant way. We observedthat S. cerevisiae cells induce trained immunity in monocytes in a strain-dependent mannerthrough enhanced TNFα and IL-6 production upon secondary stimulation with TLR ligands;as well as bacterial and fungal commensals. Differential chitin content accounts for thedifferences in training properties observed among strains; driving induction of trainedimmunity by increasing cytokine production and direct antimicrobial activity both in vitro andin vivo.

In this study; we examined whether metabolic reprogramming toward aerobicglycolysis is important for the host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Throughtranscriptional and metabolite analysis we show that Mtb induces a switch in host cellularmetabolism toward aerobic glycolysis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs). The metabolic switch is TLR2 dependent but NOD2 independent; and is mediatedin part through activation of the AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. Weshow that pharmacological inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway inhibits cellular responsesto Mtb both in vitro in human PBMCs; and in vivo in a model of murine tuberculosis.

Borrelia-induced cytokine production is mediated by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) but is Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 independent,Marije Oosting; Kathrin Buffen; Shih-Chin Cheng; Ineke C Verschueren; Frank Koentgen; Frank L van de Veerdonk; Mihai G Netea; Leo AB Joosten,Abstract Although it is known that Borrelia species express sugar-like structures on theirouter surface; not much is known about the role of these structures in immune recognition byhost cells. Fungi; like Candida albicans; are mainly recognized by C-type lectin receptors; inspecific Dectin-1 and Dectin-2. In this study we assessed the role of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 inthe recognition process of Borrelia spirochetes. Using specific inhibitors against thesereceptors on human cells did not influenced cytokine production. Individuals carrying a SNPleading to an early stop codon in the DECTIN-1 gene also did not lead to differentialinduction of Borrelia-dependent cytokines. After injection of live Borrelia into knee joints ofDectin-2 deficient mice a trend towards lower inflammation was observed. Inhibition of Sykin human cells resulted in lower cytokine production after Borrelia stimulation. In …,Cytokine,2015,4

Wedemonstrated that HMGN1 not only directly stimulated cytokine production; but also had thecapacity to induce immune tolerance in a TLR4 dependent pathway; similar tolipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tolerance. HMGN1-induced tolerance was accompaniedby a metabolic shift associated with the inhibition of the induction of Warburg effect (aerobicglycolysis) and histone deacetylation via Sirtuin-1. In addition; HMGN1 pre-challenge ofmice also downregulated TNF production similar to LPS induced tolerance in vivo. Inconclusion; HMGN1 is an endogenous TLR4 ligand that can induce both acute …,Frontiers in Immunology,2018,*

Fungal chitin induces trained immunity in human monocytes during cross-talk with Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Noemi Tocci; Lisa Rizzetto; C Ifrim; S Cheng; Jessica Quintin; Carlotta De Filippo; Tobias Weil; M Lenucci; M Santos; M Netea; Duccio Cavalieri,Objectives: Candida albicans; a common colonizer of the human mucosa; is able to traininnate immune cells in a process mediated by the β-glucans present in the cell wall1.Saccaromyces cerevisiae is another constant but harmful colonizer of humans and recentlyit has been demonstrated to be even more abundant than C. albicans2. The aim of this studywas to investigate the in vitro training properties of S. cerevisiae on innate immune cells andthe relation occurring between the cell wall composition and the observed effect. Methods:S. cerevisiae isolates from diverse ecological niches have been tested for their ability toinduce trained immunity on human monocytes. The cell wall sugar composition of the S.cerevisiae strains have been investigated through ion-exchange chromatography. Glucan;mannan and chitin have been extracted from the yeast cell wall and tested independently …,Fungal cell wall 2015,2015,*
Commensal yeast S. cerevisiae trains human monocytes for a heightened cytokine response upon bacterial encounter,Lisa Rizzetto; D Ifrim; Noemi Tocci; S Cheng; Carlotta De Filippo; Tobias Weil; M Lenucci; M Netea; Duccio Cavalieri,The immune system is essential to maintain the mutualistic homeostatic interaction betweenthe host and its micro-and mycobiota. Living as a commensal on human skin and being apassenger in the digestive tract; Saccharomyces cerevisiae could potentially modulate thehost immunity and significantly shape the immune response. We observed that diverse S.cerevisiae strains induce trained immunity in monocytes through a strain-dependent mannerleading to enhanced cytokine production upon secondary stimulation with TLR ligands andbacterial commensals. These features are reflected by the differences in the pro-inflammatory properties dependent on the origin of the strains; which may be potentiallyrelated to the different adaptation to the environment from which they were isolated. Weestablished that even though β-glucan is sufficient to train the innate immunity; S …,YEAST,2015,*
