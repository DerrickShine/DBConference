The researcher’s guide to the data deluge: Querying a scientific database in just a few seconds,Martin L Kersten; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Erietta Liarou,ABSTRACT There is a clear need for interactive exploration of extremely large databases;especially in the area of scientific data management where ingestion of multiple Terabyteson a daily basis is foreseen. Unfortunately; current data management technology is not well-suited for such overwhelming demands. In light of these challenges; we should rethink someof the strict requirements database systems adopted in the past. We envision that nextgeneration database systems should interpret queries by their intent; rather than as acontract carved in stone for complete and correct answers. The result set should aid the userin understanding the database's content and provide guidance to continue the dataexploration journey. A scientist can stepwise explore deeper and deeper into the database;and stop when the result content and quality reaches his satisfaction point. At the same …,PVLDB Challenges and Visions,2011,85
Evaluating conjunctive triple pattern queries over large structured overlay networks,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the problem of evaluating conjunctive queries composed of triple patternsover RDF data stored in distributed hash tables. Our goal is to develop algorithms that scaleto large amounts of RDF data; distribute the query processing load evenly and incur littlenetwork traffic. We present and evaluate two novel query processing algorithms with thesepossibly conflicting goals in mind. We discuss the various tradeoffs that occur in our settingthrough a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.,International Semantic Web Conference,2006,74
Exploiting the power of relational databases for efficient stream processing,Erietta Liarou; Romulo Goncalves; Stratos Idreos,Abstract Stream applications gained significant popularity over the last years that lead to thedevelopment of specialized stream engines. These systems are designed from scratch witha different philosophy than nowadays database engines in order to cope with the streamapplications requirements. However; this means that they lack the power and sophisticatedtechniques of a full fledged database system that exploits techniques and algorithmsaccumulated over many years of database research. In this paper; we take the oppositeroute and design a stream engine directly on top of a database kernel. Incoming tuples aredirectly stored upon arrival in a new kind of system tables; called baskets. A continuousquery can then be evaluated over its relevant baskets as a typical one-time query exploitingthe power of the relational engine. Once a tuple has been seen by all relevant queries …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,61
Continuous RDF query processing over DHTs,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the continuous evaluation of conjunctive triple pattern queries over RDFdata stored in distributed hash tables. In a continuous query scenario network nodessubscribe with long-standing queries and receive answers whenever RDF triples satisfyingtheir queries are published. We present two novel query processing algorithms for thisscenario and analyze their properties formally. Our performance goal is to have algorithmsthat scale to large amounts of RDF data; distribute the storage and query processing loadevenly and incur as little network traffic as possible. We discuss the various performancetradeoffs that occur through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.,*,2007,37
ATraPos: Adaptive transaction processing on hardware Islands,Danica Porobic; Erietta Liarou; Pinar Tozun; Anastasia Ailamaki,Nowadays; high-performance transaction processing applications increasingly run onmultisocket multicore servers. Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory accesslatency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately; traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-corecommunication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path.While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4processors; it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses tocentralized data structures. In this paper; we propose ATraPos; a storage manager designthat is aware of the non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems. ATraPos achievesgood data locality by carefully partitioning the data as well as internal data structures (eg …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,36
dbTouch: Analytics at your Fingertips.,Stratos Idreos; Erietta Liarou,ABSTRACT As we enter the era of data deluge; turning data into knowledge has become themajor challenge across most sciences and businesses that deal with data. In addition; as weincrease our ability to create data; more and more people are confronted with datamanagement problems on a daily basis for numerous aspects of every day life. Afundamental need is data exploration through interactive tools; ie; being able to quickly andeffortlessly determine data and patterns of interest. However; modern database systemshave not been designed with data exploration and usability in mind; they require users withexpert knowledge and skills; while they react in a strict and monolithic way to every userrequest; resulting in correct answers but slow response times. In this paper; we introduce thevision of a new generation of data management systems; called dbTouch; our vision is to …,CIDR,2013,36
Continuous multi-way joins over distributed hash tables,Stratos Idreos; Erietta Liarou; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract This paper studies the problem of evaluating continuous multi-way joins on top ofDistributed Hash Tables (DHTs). We present a novel algorithm; called recursive join (RJoin);that takes into account various parameters crucial in a distributed setting ie; network traffic;query processing load distribution; storage load distribution etc. The key idea of RJoin isincremental evaluation: as relevant tuples arrive continuously; a given multi-way join isrewritten continuously into a join with fewer join operators; and is assigned continuously todifferent nodes of the network. In this way; RJoin distributes the responsibility of evaluating acontinuous multi-way join to many network nodes by assigning parts of the evaluation ofeach binary join to a different node depending on the values of the join attributes. The actualnodes to be involved are decided by RJoin dynamically after taking into account the rate …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,27
MonetDB/DataCell: online analytics in a streaming column-store,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract In DataCell; we design streaming functionalities in a modern relational databasekernel which targets big data analytics. This includes exploitation of both itsstorage/execution engine and its optimizer infrastructure. We investigate the opportunitiesand challenges that arise with such a direction and we show that it carries significantadvantages for modern applications in need for online analytics such as web logs; networkmonitoring and scientific data management. The major challenge then becomes the efficientsupport for specialized stream features; eg; multi-query processing and incremental window-based processing as well as exploiting standard DBMS functionalities in a streamingenvironment such as indexing.

A query language for a data refinery cell,Martin Kersten; Erietta Liarou; Romulo Goncalves,Abstract In this paper we propose the DataCell; an event management system designed asa flexible data hub in an ambient environment and we mainly focus on its languageinterface. The DataCell provides an orthogonal extension to SQL'03; called “basketexpressions”; which behave as predicate windows over multiple streams and which can bebulk processed for good resource utilization. The functionality offered by basket expressionsis illustrated with numerous examples to model complex event processing applications. TheDataCell capitalizes the architectural choices and performance characteristics of a moderncolumn-store relational DBMS. The design and implementation of the DataCell does notaffect the underlying database kernel and the SQL software stack. This means that theDataCell extends the functionality of the DBMS without hampering the already given …,Proc. Int. Workshop on Event-Driven Architecture; Processing and Systems,2007,20
Publish/subscribe with RDF data over large structured overlay networks,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the problem of evaluating RDF queries over structured overlay networks.We consider the publish/subscribe scenario where nodes subscribe with long-standingqueries and receive notifications whenever triples matching their queries are inserted in thenetwork. In this paper we focus on conjunctive multi-predicate queries. We demonstrate thatthese queries are useful in various modern applications eg; distributed digital libraries orGrid resource discovery. Conjunctive multi-predicate queries are hard to answer sincemultiple triples are necessary for their evaluation; and these triples will usually be inserted inthe network asynchronously. We present and evaluate query processing algorithms that arescalable and distribute the query processing load evenly.,*,2007,19
Enhanced stream processing in a DBMS kernel,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Continuous query processing has emerged as a promising query processingparadigm with numerous applications. A recent development is the need to handle bothstreaming queries and typical one-time queries in the same application. For example; datawarehousing can greatly benefit from the integration of stream semantics; ie; online analysisof incoming data and combination with existing data. This is especially useful to provide lowlatency in data-intensive analysis in big data warehouses that are augmented with new dataon a daily basis. However; state-of-the-art database technology cannot handle streamsefficiently due to their" continuous" nature. At the same time; state-of-the-art streamtechnology is purely focused on stream applications. The research efforts are mostly gearedtowards the creation of specialized stream management systems built with a different …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,15
Semantic grid resource discovery in Atlas,Zoi Kaoudi; Iris Miliaraki; Matoula Magiridou; Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the problem of resource discovery in the Semantic Grid. We show how tosolve this problem by utilizing Atlas; a P2P system for the distributed storage and retrieval ofRDF (S) data. Atlas is currently under development in project OntoGrid funded by FP6. Atlasis built on top of the distributed hash table Bamboo and supports pull and push queryingscenarios. It inherits all the nice features of Bamboo (openness; scalability; fault-tolerance;resistance to high churn rates) and extends Bamboo's protocols for storing and queryingRDF (S) data. Atlas is being used currently to realize the metadata service of S-OGSA in afully distributed and scalable way. In this paper; we concentrate on the main features of Atlasand demonstrate its use for Semantic Grid resource discovery in an OntoGrid use casescenario.,*,2007,12
Dynamic fine-grained scheduling for energy-efficient main-memory queries,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Thomas Kissinger; Danica Porobic; Thomas Ilsche; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki; Wolfgang Lehner,Abstract Power and cooling costs are some of the highest costs in data centers today; whichmake improvement in energy efficiency crucial. Energy efficiency is also a major designpoint for chips that power whole ranges of computing devices. One important goal in thisarea is energy proportionality; arguing that the system's power consumption should beproportional to its performance. Currently; a major trend among server processors; whichstems from the design of chips for mobile devices; is the inclusion of advanced powermanagement techniques; such as dynamic voltage-frequency scaling; clock gating; andturbo modes. A lot of recent work on energy efficiency of database management systems isfocused on coarse-grained power management at the granularity of multiple machines andwhole queries. These techniques; however; cannot efficiently adapt to the frequently …,Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2014,11
dbTouch in action database kernels for touch-based data exploration,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos,A fundamental need in the era of data deluge is data exploration through interactive tools; ie;being able to quickly determine data and patterns of interest. dbTouch is a new researchdirection towards a next generation of data management systems that inherently supportdata exploration by allowing touch-based interaction. Data is represented in a visual format;while users can touch those shapes and interact/query with gestures. In a dbTouch system;the whole database kernel is geared towards quick responses in touch input; the user drivesquery processing (not just query construction) via touch gestures; dictating how fast or slowdata flows through query plans and which data parts are processed at any time. dbTouchtranslates the gestures into interactive database operators; reacting continuously to thetouch input and analytics tasks given by the user in real-time such as sliding a finger over …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,9
DiNoDB: Efficient large-scale raw data analytics,Yongchao Tian; Ioannis Alagiannis; Erietta Liarou; Anastasia Ailamaki; Pietro Michiardi; Marko Vukolić,Abstract Modern big data workflows; found in eg; machine learning use cases; often involveiterations of cycles of batch analytics and interactive analytics on temporary data. Whereasbatch analytics solutions for large volumes of raw data are well established (eg; Hadoop;MapReduce); state-of-the-art interactive analytics solutions (eg; distributed shared nothingRDBMSs) require data loading and/or transformation phase; which is inherently expensivefor temporary data. In this paper; we propose a novel scalable distributed solution for in-situdata analytics; that offers both scalable batch and interactive data analytics on raw data;hence avoiding the loading phase bottleneck of RDBMSs. Our system combines aMapReduce based platform with the recently proposed NoDB paradigm; which optimizestraditional centralized RDBMSs for in-situ queries of raw files.

How to stop under-utilization and love multicores,Anastasia Ailamaki; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Danica Porobic; Iraklis Psaroudakis,Hardware trends oblige software to overcome three major challenges against systemsscalability:(1) taking advantage of the implicit/vertical parallelism within a core that isenabled through the aggressive micro-architectural features;(2) exploiting theexplicit/horizontal parallelism provided by multicores; and (3) achieving predictively efficientexecution despite the variability in communication latencies among cores on multisocketmulticores. In this three hour tutorial; we shed light on the above three challenges andsurvey recent proposals to alleviate them. The first part of the tutorial describes theinstruction-and data-level parallelism opportunities in a core coming from the hardware andsoftware side. In addition; it examines the sources of under-utilization in a modern processorand presents insights and hardware/software techniques to better exploit the micro …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6

DiNoDB: An Interactive-Speed Query Engine for Ad-Hoc Queries on Temporary Data,Yongchao Tian; Ioannis Alagiannis; Erietta Liarou; Anastasia Ailamaki; Pietro Michiardi; Marko Vukolić,As data sets grow in size; analytics applications struggle to get instant insight into largedatasets. Modern applications involve heavy batch processing jobs over large volumes ofdata and at the same time require efficient ad-hoc interactive analytics on temporary data.Existing solutions; however; typically focus on one of these two aspects; largely ignoring theneed for synergy between the two. Consequently; interactive queries need to re-iteratecostly passes through the entire dataset (eg; data loading) that may provide meaningfulreturn on investment only when data is queried over a long period of time. In this paper; wepropose DiNoDB; an interactive-speed query engine for ad-hoc queries on temporary data.DiNoDB avoids the expensive loading and transformation phase that characterizes bothtraditional RDBMSs and current interactive analytics solutions.

MonetDB/DataCell: leveraging the column-store database technology for efficient and scalable stream processing,Erietta Liarou,Knowledge is a concept that the ancient philosophers studied more than 2000 years ago.Plato and Aristotle; already in 400 BC; tried to understand and define what is knowledge andhow it is created and acquired. In the Theory of Ideas (or Forms); Plato argues that theknowledge is already created and given to us from a universal metaphysical level. In thisway; he claims that we learn in this life by remembering and trying to imitate the principlesthat our soul already encloses from the world of Ideas. On the other hand; Aristotle; the mostimportant student of Plato for twenty years; supported that the observation and the study ofparticular phenomena will lead us to the real knowledge. Over the years; the definition ofknowledge constituted an ongoing debate among philosophers and the triptych of the truejustified belief has been challenged by modern epistemologists several times (Gettier …,*,2013,1

A hybrid peer-to-peer system with a schema based routing strategy,Erietta Liarou,Abstract During the last years; the area of peer-to-peer systems has attracted much interestin the research community. Peer-to-peer technology has become popular mainly through filesharing applications such as Napster; Gnutella and KazaA. At the same time; the amount ofavailable information on the Web is growing; so its organization in a semantic way becomesimperative. The combination of Semantic Web and peer-to-peer technologies will probablyprovide accurate data retrieval and efficient search. For peer-to-peer environments;metadata are absolutely crucial in order to describe the resources managed by the peers.Schemabased peer-to-peer networks have a number of important advantages over previoussimpler peer-to-peer networks.

A column-oriented data stream engine,Erietta Liarou; Romulo Goncalves; Martin Kersten,ABSTRACT This paper introduces the DataCell; a data stream management systemdesigned as a seamless integration of continuous queries based on bulk event processingin an SQL software stack. The continuous stream queries are based on a predicate-window;called “basket” expressions; which support arbitrary complex SQL subqueries including; butnot limited to; temporal and sequence constraints. The DataCell is designed for bulk eventprocessing to capitalize proven relational column-store database technology to achieveefficient resource utilization. It is implemented on top of an open-source DBMS. In this workwe describe in detail the DataCell architecture; its data model; and its processing scheme.An analysis of the core algorithms provides an outlook on its performance in the envisionedapplication domains.,*,*,*
