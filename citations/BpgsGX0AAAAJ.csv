Anatomy: Simple and effective privacy preservation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract This paper presents a novel technique; anatomy; for publishing sensitive data.Anatomy releases all the quasi-identifier and sensitive values directly in two separate tables.Combined with a grouping mechanism; this approach protects privacy; and captures a largeamount of correlation in the microdata. We develop a linear-time algorithm for computinganatomized tables that obey the l-diversity privacy requirement; and minimize the error ofreconstructing the microdata. Extensive experiments confirm that our technique allowssignificantly more effective data analysis than the conventional publication method based ongeneralization. Specifically; anatomy permits aggregate reasoning with average error below10%; which is lower than the error obtained from a generalized table by orders ofmagnitude.,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,751
Personalized privacy preservation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract We study generalization for preserving privacy in publication of sensitive data. Theexisting methods focus on a universal approach that exerts the same amount of preservationfor all persons; with-out catering for their concrete needs. The consequence is that we maybe offering insufficient protection to a subset of people; while applying excessive privacycontrol to another subset. Motivated by this; we present a new generalization frameworkbased on the concept of personalized anonymity. Our technique performs the minimumgeneralization for satisfying everybody's requirements; and thus; retains the largest amountof information from the microdata. We carry out a careful theoretical study that leads tovaluable insight into the behavior of alternative solutions. In particular; our analysismathematically reveals the circumstances where the previous work fails to protect privacy …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,601
M-invariance: towards privacy preserving re-publication of dynamic datasets,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract The previous literature of privacy preserving data publication has focused onperforming" one-time" releases. Specifically; none of the existing solutions supports re-publication of the microdata; after it has been updated with insertions< u> and</u> deletions.This is a serious drawback; because currently a publisher cannot provide researchers withthe most recent dataset continuously. This paper remedies the drawback. First; we reveal thecharacteristics of the re-publication problem that invalidate the conventional approachesleveraging k-anonymity and l-diversity. Based on rigorous theoretical analysis; we develop anew generalization principle m-invariance that effectively limits the risk of privacy disclosurein re-publication. We accompany the principle with an algorithm; which computes privacy-guarded relations that permit retrieval of accurate aggregate information about the …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,484
Indexing multi-dimensional uncertain data with arbitrary probability density functions,Yufei Tao; Reynold Cheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Wang Kay Ngai; Ben Kao; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract In an" uncertain database"; an object o is associated with a multi-dimensionalprobability density function (pdf); which describes the likelihood that o appears at eachposition in the data space. A fundamental operation is the" probabilistic range search"which; given a value pq and a rectangular area rq; retrieves the objects that appear in rqwith probabilities at least p q. In this paper; we propose the U-tree; an access methoddesigned to optimize both the I/O and CPU time of range retrieval on multi-dimensionalimprecise data. The new structure is fully dynamic (ie; objects can be incrementallyinserted/deleted in any order); and does not place any constraints on the data pdfs. Weverify the query and update efficiency of U-trees with extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,350
Differential privacy via wavelet transforms,Xiaokui Xiao; Guozhang Wang; Johannes Gehrke,Privacy-preserving data publishing has attracted considerable research interest in recentyears. Among the existing solutions;∈-differential privacy provides the strongest privacyguarantee. Existing data publishing methods that achieve∈-differential privacy; however;offer little data utility. In particular; if the output data set is used to answer count queries; thenoise in the query answers can be proportional to the number of tuples in the data; whichrenders the results useless. In this paper; we develop a data publishing technique thatensures∈-differential privacy while providing accurate answers for range-count queries; ie;count queries where the predicate on each attribute is a range. The core of our solution is aframework that applies wavelet transforms on the data before adding noise to it. We presentinstantiations of the proposed framework for both ordinal and nominal data; and we …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,329
Subsky: Efficient computation of skylines in subspaces,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei,Given a set of multi-dimensional points; the skyline contains the best points according to anypreference function that is monotone on all axes. In practice; applications that require skylineanalysis usually provide numerous candidate attributes; and various users depending ontheir interests may issue queries regarding different (small) subsets of the dimensions.Formally; given a relation with a large number (eg; ge 10) of attributes; a query aims atfinding the skyline in an arbitrary subspace with a low dimensionality (eg; 2). The existingalgorithms do not support subspace skyline retrieval efficiently because they (i) requirescanning the entire database at least once; or (ii) are optimized for one particular subspacebut incur significant overhead for other subspaces. In this paper; we propose a techniqueSUBSKY which settles the problem using a single B-tree; and can be implemented in any …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Influence maximization: Near-optimal time complexity meets practical efficiency,Youze Tang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yanchen Shi,Abstract Given a social network G and a constant $ k $; the influence maximization problemasks for k nodes in G that (directly and indirectly) influence the largest number of nodesunder a pre-defined diffusion model. This problem finds important applications in viralmarketing; and has been extensively studied in the literature. Existing algorithms forinfluence maximization; however; either trade approximation guarantees for practicalefficiency; or vice versa. In particular; among the algorithms that achieve constant factorapproximations under the prominent independent cascade (IC) model or linear threshold(LT) model; none can handle a million-node graph without incurring prohibitive overheads.This paper presents TIM; an algorithm that aims to bridge the theory and practice ininfluence maximization. On the theory side; we show that TIM runs in O ((k+ l)(n+m) log n …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,195
AR-miner: mining informative reviews for developers from mobile app marketplace,Ning Chen; Jialiu Lin; Steven CH Hoi; Xiaokui Xiao; Boshen Zhang,Abstract With the popularity of smartphones and mobile devices; mobile application (aka“app”) markets have been growing exponentially in terms of number of users anddownloads. App developers spend considerable effort on collecting and exploiting userfeedback to improve user satisfaction; but suffer from the absence of effective user reviewanalytics tools. To facilitate mobile app developers discover the most “informative” userreviews from a large and rapidly increasing pool of user reviews; we present “AR-Miner”—anovel computational framework for App Review Mining; which performs comprehensiveanalytics from raw user reviews by (i) first extracting informative user reviews by filteringnoisy and irrelevant ones;(ii) then grouping the informative reviews automatically using topicmodeling;(iii) further prioritizing the informative reviews by an effective review ranking …,Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering,2014,179
Differentially private histogram publication,Jia Xu; Zhenjie Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Ge Yu; Marianne Winslett,Abstract Differential privacy (DP) is a promising scheme for releasing the results of statisticalqueries on sensitive data; with strong privacy guarantees against adversaries with arbitrarybackground knowledge. Existing studies on differential privacy mostly focus on simpleaggregations such as counts. This paper investigates the publication of DP-complianthistograms; which is an important analytical tool for showing the distribution of a randomvariable; eg; hospital bill size for certain patients. Compared to simple aggregations whoseresults are purely numerical; a histogram query is inherently more complex; since it mustalso determine its structure; ie; the ranges of the bins. As we demonstrate in the paper; a DP-compliant histogram with finer bins may actually lead to significantly lower accuracy than acoarser one; since the former requires stronger perturbations in order to satisfy DP …,The VLDB Journal,2013,176
Range search on multidimensional uncertain data,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Reynold Cheng,Abstract In an uncertain database; every object o is associated with a probability densityfunction; which describes the likelihood that o appears at each position in amultidimensional workspace. This article studies two types of range retrieval fundamental tomany analytical tasks. Specifically; a nonfuzzy query returns all the objects that appear in asearch region rq with at least a certain probability t q. On the other hand; given an uncertainobject q; fuzzy search retrieves the set of objects that are within distance &epsiv; q from qwith no less than probability t q. The core of our methodology is a novel concept of“probabilistically constrained rectangle”; which permits effective pruning/validation ofnonqualifying/qualifying data. We develop a new index structure called the U-tree forminimizing the query overhead. Our algorithmic findings are accompanied with a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,153
Preservation of proximity privacy in publishing numerical sensitive data,Jiexing Li; Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract We identify proximity breach as a privacy threat specific to numerical sensitiveattributes in anonymized data publication. Such breach occurs when an adversaryconcludes with high confidence that the sensitive value of a victim individual must fall in ashort interval---even though the adversary may have low confidence about the victim's actualvalue. None of the existing anonymization principles (eg; k-anonymity; l-diversity; etc.) caneffectively prevent proximity breach. We remedy the problem by introducing a novel principlecalled (ε; m)-anonymity. Intuitively; the principle demands that; given a QI-group G; for everysensitive value x in G; at most 1/m of the tuples in G can have sensitive values" similar" to x;where the similarity is controlled by ε. We provide a careful analytical study of the theoreticalcharacteristics of (ε; m)-anonymity; and the corresponding generalization algorithm.

Influence maximization in near-linear time: A martingale approach,Youze Tang; Yanchen Shi; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Given a social network G and a positive integer k; the influence maximizationproblem asks for k nodes (in G) whose adoptions of a certain idea or product can trigger thelargest expected number of follow-up adoptions by the remaining nodes. This problem hasbeen extensively studied in the literature; and the state-of-the-art technique runs in O((k+l)(n+ m) log n ε 2) expected time and returns a (1-1 e-ε)-approximate solution with atleast 1-1/nl probability. This paper presents an influence maximization algorithm thatprovides the same worst-case guarantees as the state of the art; but offers significantlyimproved empirical efficiency. The core of our algorithm is a set of estimation techniquesbased on martingales; a classic statistical tool. Those techniques not only provide accurateresults with small computation overheads; but also enable our algorithm to support a …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,124
Secure nearest neighbor revisited,Bin Yao; Feifei Li; Xiaokui Xiao,In this paper; we investigate the secure nearest neighbor (SNN) problem; in which a clientissues an encrypted query point E (q) to a cloud service provider and asks for an encrypteddata point in E (D)(the encrypted database) that is closest to the query point; withoutallowing the server to learn the plaintexts of the data or the query (and its result). We showthat efficient attacks exist for existing SNN methods [21];[15]; even though they were claimedto be secure in standard security models (such as indistinguishability under chosen plaintextor ciphertext attacks). We also establish a relationship between the SNN problem and theorder-preserving encryption (OPE) problem from the cryptography field [6];[5]; and we showthat SNN is at least as hard as OPE. Since it is impossible to construct secure OPE schemesin standard security models [6];[5]; our results imply that one cannot expect to find the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,121
Functional mechanism: regression analysis under differential privacy,Jun Zhang; Zhenjie Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Marianne Winslett,Abstract ε-differential privacy is the state-of-the-art model for releasing sensitive informationwhile protecting privacy. Numerous methods have been proposed to enforce ε-differentialprivacy in various analytical tasks; eg; regression analysis. Existing solutions for regressionanalysis; however; are either limited to non-standard types of regression or unable toproduce accurate regression results. Motivated by this; we propose the FunctionalMechanism; a differentially private method designed for a large class of optimization-basedanalyses. The main idea is to enforce ε-differential privacy by perturbing the objectivefunction of the optimization problem; rather than its results. As case studies; we apply thefunctional mechanism to address two most widely used regression models; namely; linearregression and logistic regression. Both theoretical analysis and thorough experimental …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,120
Efficient skyline and top-k retrieval in subspaces,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei,Skyline and top-k queries are two popular operations for preference retrieval. In practice;applications that require these operations usually provide numerous candidate attributes;whereas; depending on their interests; users may issue queries regarding different subsetsof the dimensions. The existing algorithms are inadequate for subspace skyline/top-k searchbecause they have at least one of the following defects: 1) they require scanning the entiredatabase at least once; 2) they are optimized for one subspace but incur significantoverhead for other subspaces; or 3) they demand expensive maintenance cost or spaceconsumption. In this paper; we propose a technique SUBSKY; which settles both types ofqueries by using purely relational technologies. The core of SUBSKY is a transformation thatconverts multidimensional data to one-dimensional (1D) values. These values are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,106
iReduct: differential privacy with reduced relative errors,Xiaokui Xiao; Gabriel Bender; Michael Hay; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Prior work in differential privacy has produced techniques for answering aggregatequeries over sensitive data in a privacy-preserving way. These techniques achieve privacyby adding noise to the query answers. Their objective is typically to minimize absolute errorswhile satisfying differential privacy. Thus; query answers are injected with noise whose scaleis independent of whether the answers are large or small. The noisy results for querieswhose true answers are small therefore tend to be dominated by noise; which leads toinferior data utility. This paper introduces iReduct; a differentially private algorithm forcomputing answers with reduced relative error. The basic idea of iReduct is to inject differentamounts of noise to different query results; so that smaller (larger) values are more likely tobe injected with less (more) noise. The algorithm is based on a novel resampling …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of Data,2011,105
Mining distance-based outliers from large databases in any metric space,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Let R be a set of objects. An object o∈ R is an outlier; if there exist less than kobjects in R whose distances to o are at most r. The values of k; r; and the distance metricare provided by a user at the run time. The objective is to return all outliers with the smallestI/O cost. This paper considers a generic version of the problem; where no information isavailable for outlier computation; except for objects' mutual distances. We prove an upperbound for the memory consumption which permits the discovery of all outliers by scanningthe dataset 3 times. The upper bound turns out to be extremely low in practice; eg; less than1% of R. Since the actual memory capacity of a realistic DBMS is typically larger; we developa novel algorithm; which integrates our theoretical findings with carefully-designed heuristicsthat leverage the additional memory to improve I/O efficiency. Our technique reports all …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,98
Publishing search logs—a comparative study of privacy guarantees,Michaela Gotz; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Guozhang Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Johannes Gehrke,Search engine companies collect the “database of intentions;” the histories of their users'search queries. These search logs are a gold mine for researchers. Search enginecompanies; however; are wary of publishing search logs in order not to disclose sensitiveinformation. In this paper; we analyze algorithms for publishing frequent keywords; queries;and clicks of a search log. We first show how methods that achieve variants of k-anonymityare vulnerable to active attacks. We then demonstrate that the stronger guarantee ensuredby ε-differential privacy unfortunately does not provide any utility for this problem. We thenpropose an algorithm ZEALOUS and show how to set its parameters to achieve (ε; δ)-probabilistic privacy. We also contrast our analysis of ZEALOUS with an analysis byKorolova et al.[17] that achieves (ε'; δ')-indistinguishability. Our paper concludes with a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,97
Privbayes: Private data release via bayesian networks,Jun Zhang; Graham Cormode; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publishing is an important problem that has been the focusof extensive study. The state-of-the-art solution for this problem is differential privacy; whichoffers a strong degree of privacy protection without making restrictive assumptions about theadversary. Existing techniques using differential privacy; however; cannot effectively handlethe publication of high-dimensional data. In particular; when the input dataset contains alarge number of attributes; existing methods require injecting a prohibitive amount of noisecompared to the signal in the data; which renders the published data next to useless. Toaddress the deficiency of the existing methods; this paper presents P riv B ayes; adifferentially private method for releasing high-dimensional data.

Shortest path and distance queries on road networks: An experimental evaluation,Lingkun Wu; Xiaokui Xiao; Dingxiong Deng; Gao Cong; Andy Diwen Zhu; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Computing the shortest path between two given locations in a road network is animportant problem that finds applications in various map services and commercialnavigation products. The state-of-the-art solutions for the problem can be divided into twocategories: spatial-coherence-based methods and vertex-importance-based approaches.The two categories of techniques; however; have not been compared systematically underthe same experimental framework; as they were developed from two independent lines ofresearch that do not refer to each other. This renders it difficult for a practitioner to decidewhich technique should be adopted for a specific application. Furthermore; the experimentalevaluation of the existing techniques; as presented in previous work; falls short in severalaspects. Some methods were tested only on small road networks with up to one hundred …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,83
Multidimensional reverse kNN search,Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; Xiang Lian; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Given a multidimensional point q; a reverse k nearest neighbor (R k NN) queryretrieves all the data points that have q as one of their k nearest neighbors. Existing methodsfor processing such queries have at least one of the following deficiencies: they (i) do notsupport arbitrary values of k;(ii) cannot deal efficiently with database updates;(iii) areapplicable only to 2D data but not to higher dimensionality; and (iv) retrieve onlyapproximate results. Motivated by these shortcomings; we develop algorithms for exact R kNN processing with arbitrary values of k on dynamic; multidimensional datasets. Ourmethods utilize a conventional data-partitioning index on the dataset and do not require anypre-computation. As a second step; we extend the proposed techniques to continuous R kNN search; which returns the R k NN results for every point on a line segment.

On anti-corruption privacy preserving publication,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jiexing Li; Donghui Zhang,This paper deals with a new type of privacy threat; called" corruption"; in anonymized datapublication. Specifically; an adversary is said to have corrupted some individuals; if s/he hasalready obtained their sensitive values before consulting the released information.Conventional generalization may lead to severe privacy disclosure in the presence ofcorruption. Motivated by this; we advocate an alternative anonymization technique thatintegrates generalization with perturbation and stratified sampling. The integration providesstrong privacy guarantees; even if an adversary has corrupted any number of individuals.We verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique through experiments with real data.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Shortest path and distance queries on road networks: towards bridging theory and practice,Andy Diwen Zhu; Hui Ma; Xiaokui Xiao; Siqiang Luo; Youze Tang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Given two locations s and t in a road network; a distance query returns the minimumnetwork distance from s to t; while a shortest path query computes the actual route thatachieves the minimum distance. These two types of queries find important applications inpractice; and a plethora of solutions have been proposed in past few decades. The existingsolutions; however; are optimized for either practical or asymptotic performance; but notboth. In particular; the techniques with enhanced practical efficiency are mostly heuristic-based; and they offer unattractive worst-case guarantees in terms of space and time. On theother hand; the methods that are worst-case efficient often entail prohibitive preprocessingor space overheads; which render them inapplicable for the large road networks (withmillions of nodes) commonly used in modern map applications.

Low-rank mechanism: optimizing batch queries under differential privacy,Ganzhao Yuan; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Differential privacy is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for statistical queryprocessing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random noise into each query result;such that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of anyindividual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially privatequery processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results; while satisfying theprivacy guarantees. Previous work; notably the matrix mechanism [16]; has suggested thatprocessing a batch of correlated queries as a whole can potentially achieve considerableaccuracy gains; compared to answering them individually. However; as we point out in thispaper; the matrix mechanism is mainly of theoretical interest; in particular; several inherentproblems in its design limit its accuracy in practice; which almost never exceeds that of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,67
Differential privacy in data publication and analysis,Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Gerome Miklau; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Data privacy has been an important research topic in the security; theory anddatabase communities in the last few decades. However; many existing studies haverestrictive assumptions regarding the adversary's prior knowledge; meaning that theypreserve individuals' privacy only when the adversary has rather limited backgroundinformation about the sensitive data; or only uses certain kinds of attacks. Recently;differential privacy has emerged as a new paradigm for privacy protection with veryconservative assumptions about the adversary's prior knowledge. Since its proposal;differential privacy had been gaining attention in many fields of computer science; and isconsidered among the most promising paradigms for privacy-preserving data publicationand analysis. In this tutorial; we will motivate its introduction as a replacement for other …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,65
Optimal location queries in road network databases,Xiaokui Xiao; Bin Yao; Feifei Li,Optimal location (OL) queries are a type of spatial queries particularly useful for the strategicplanning of resources. Given a set of existing facilities and a set of clients; an OL query asksfor a location to build a new facility that optimizes a certain cost metric (defined based on thedistances between the clients and the facilities). Several techniques have been proposed toaddress OL queries; assuming that all clients and facilities reside in an L p space. Inpractice; however; movements between spatial locations are usually confined by theunderlying road network; and hence; the actual distance between two locations can differsignificantly from their L p distance. Motivated by the deficiency of the existing techniques;this paper presents the first study on OL queries in road networks. We propose a unifiedframework that addresses three variants of OL queries that find important applications in …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,65
On efficient spatial matching,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yufei Tao; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract This paper proposes and solves a new problem called spatial matching (SPM). LetP and O be two sets of objects in an arbitrary metric space; where object distances aredefined according to a norm satisfying the triangle inequality. Each object in O represents acustomer; and each object in P indicates a service provider; which has a capacitycorresponding to the maximum number of customers that can be supported by the provider.SPM assigns each customer to her/his nearest provider; among all the providers whosecapacities have not been exhausted in serving other closer customers. We elaborate theapplications where SPM is useful; and develop algorithms that settle this problem with alinear number O (| P|+| O|) of nearest neighbor queries.

Minimal mapreduce algorithms,Yufei Tao; Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract MapReduce has become a dominant parallel computing paradigm for big data; ie;colossal datasets at the scale of tera-bytes or higher. Ideally; a MapReduce system shouldachieve a high degree of load balancing among the participating machines; and minimizethe space usage; CPU and I/O time; and network transfer at each machine. Although theseprinciples have guided the development of MapReduce algorithms; limited emphasis hasbeen placed on enforcing serious constraints on the aforementioned metrics simultaneously.This paper presents the notion of minimal algorithm; that is; an algorithm that guarantees thebest parallelization in multiple aspects at the same time; up to a small constant factor.

The hardness and approximation algorithms for l-diversity,Xiaokui Xiao; Ke Yi; Yufei Tao,Abstract The existing solutions to privacy preserving publication can be classified into thetheoretical and heuristic categories. The former guarantees provably low information loss;whereas the latter incurs gigantic loss in the worst case; but is shown empirically to performwell on many real inputs. While numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed tosatisfy advanced privacy principles such as l-diversity; t-closeness; etc.; the theoreticalcategory is currently limited to k-anonymity which is the earliest principle known to havesevere vulnerability to privacy attacks. Motivated by this; we present the first theoretical studyon l-diversity; a popular principle that is widely adopted in the literature. First; we show thatoptimal l-diverse generalization is NP-hard even when there are only 3 distinct sensitivevalues in the microdata. Then; an (l· d)-approximation algorithm is developed; where d is …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,57
Superseding nearest neighbor search on uncertain spatial databases,Sze Man Yuen; Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei; Donghui Zhang,This paper proposes a new problem; called superseding nearest neighbor search; onuncertain spatial databases; where each object is described by a multidimensionalprobability density function. Given a query point q; an object is a nearest neighbor (NN)candidate if it has a nonzero probability to be the NN of q. Given two NN-candidates o 1 ando 2; o 1 supersedes o 2 if o 1 is more likely to be closer to q. An object is a supersedingnearest neighbor (SNN) of q; if it supersedes all the other NN-candidates. Sometimes noobject is able to supersede every other NN-candidate. In this case; we return the SNN-core-the minimum set of NN-candidates each of which supersedes all the NN-candidates outsidethe SNN-core. Intuitively; the SNN-core contains the best objects; because any objectoutside the SNN-core is worse than all the objects in the SNN-core. We show that the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,56
Differentially private event sequences over infinite streams,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Xiaokui Xiao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Numerous applications require continuous publication of statistics or monitoringpurposes; such as real-time traffic analysis; timely disease outbreak discovery; and socialtrends observation. These statistics may be derived from sensitive user data and; hence;necessitate privacy preservation. A notable paradigm for offering strong privacy guaranteesin statistics publishing is ε-differential privacy. However; there is limited literature that adaptsthis concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an infinite stream of"events"(ie; data items generated by the users); and published periodically. These works aimat hiding a single event over the entire stream. We argue that; in most practical scenarios;sensitive information is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous timeinstances. Towards this end; we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy over infinite …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,55
Keyword-aware optimal route search,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Identifying a preferable route is an important problem that finds applications in mapservices. When a user plans a trip within a city; the user may want to find" a most popularroute such that it passes by shopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to andfrom his hotel is within 4 hours." However; none of the algorithms in the existing work onroute planning can be used to answer such queries. Motivated by this; we define theproblem of keyword-aware optimal route query; denoted by KOR; which is to find an optimalroute such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint issatisfied; and an objective score of the route is optimal. The problem of answering KORqueries is NP-hard. We devise an approximation algorithm OSScaling with provableapproximation bounds. Based on this algorithm; another more efficient approximation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,55
Angel: Enhancing the utility of generalization for privacy preserving publication,Yufei Tao; Hekang Chen; Xiaokui Xiao; Shuigeng Zhou; Donghui Zhang,Generalization is a well-known method for privacy preserving data publication. Despite itsvast popularity; it has several drawbacks such as heavy information loss; difficulty ofsupporting marginal publication; and so on. To overcome these drawbacks; we developANGEL; 1 a new anonymization technique that is as effective as generalization in privacyprotection; but is able to retain significantly more information in the microdata. ANGEL isapplicable to any monotonic principles (eg; l-diversity; t-closeness; etc.); with its superiority(in correlation preservation) especially obvious when tight privacy control must be enforced.We show that ANGEL lends itself elegantly to the hard problem of marginal publication. Inparticular; unlike generalization that can release only restricted marginals; our techniquecan be easily used to publish any marginals with strong privacy guarantees.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2009,55
Optimal random perturbation at multiple privacy levels,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao; Minghua Chen,Abstract Random perturbation is a popular method of computing anonymized data forprivacy preserving data mining. It is simple to apply; ensures strong privacy protection; andpermits effective mining of a large variety of data patterns. However; all the existing studieswith good privacy guarantees focus on perturbation at a single privacy level. Namely; a fixeddegree of privacy protection is imposed on all anonymized data released by the data holder.This drawback seriously limits the applicability of random perturbation in scenarios wherethe holder has numerous recipients to which different privacy levels apply. Motivated by this;we study the problem of multi-level perturbation; whose objective is to release multipleversions of a dataset anonymized at different privacy levels. The challenge is that variousrecipients may collude by sharing their data to infer privacy beyond their permitted levels …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,50
Large-scale frequent subgraph mining in mapreduce,Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao; Gabriel Ghinita,Mining frequent subgraphs from a large collection of graph objects is an important problemin several application domains such as bio-informatics; social networks; computer vision;etc. The main challenge in subgraph mining is efficiency; as (i) testing for graphisomorphisms is computationally intensive; and (ii) the cardinality of the graph collection tobe mined may be very large. We propose a two-step filter-and-refinement approach that issuitable to massive parallelization within the scalable MapReduce computing model. Wepartition the collection of graphs among worker nodes; and each worker applies the filterstep to determine a set of candidate subgraphs that are locally frequent in its partition.

Dynamic anonymization: accurate statistical analysis with privacy preservation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract A statistical database (StatDB) retrieves only aggregate results; as opposed toindividual tuples. This paper investigates the construction of a privacy preserving StatDB thatcan (i) accurately answer an infinite number of counting queries; and (ii) effectively protectprivacy against an adversary that may have acquired all the previous query results. The coreof our solutions is a novel technique called dynamic anonymization. Specifically; given aquery; we on the fly compute a tailor-made anonymized version of the microdata; whichmaximizes the precision of the query result.

Embellishing text search queries to protect user privacy,HweeHwa Pang; Xuhua Ding; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Users of text search engines are increasingly wary that their activities may discloseconfidential information about their business or personal profiles. It would be desirable for asearch engine to perform document retrieval for users while protecting their intent. In thispaper; we identify the privacy risks arising from semantically related search terms within aquery; and from recurring high-specificity query terms in a search session. To counter therisks; we propose a solution for a similarity text retrieval system to offer anonymity andplausible deniability for the query terms; and hence the user intent; without degrading thesystem's precision-recall performance. The solution comprises a mechanism thatembellishes each user query with decoy terms that exhibit similar specificity spread as thegenuine terms; but point to plausible alternative topics. We also provide an …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,40
PrivGene: differentially private model fitting using genetic algorithms,Jun Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett,Abstract epsilon-differential privacy is rapidly emerging as the state-of-the-art scheme forprotecting individuals' privacy in published analysis results over sensitive data. The mainidea is to perform random perturbations on the analysis results; such that any individual'spresence in the data has negligible impact on the randomized results. This paper focuses onanalysis tasks that involve model fitting; ie; finding the parameters of a statistical model thatbest fit the dataset. For such tasks; the quality of the differentially private results dependsupon both the effectiveness of the model fitting algorithm; and the amount of perturbationsrequired to satisfy the privacy guarantees. Most previous studies start from a state-of-the-art;non-private model fitting algorithm; and develop a differentially private version.Unfortunately; many model fitting algorithms require intensive perturbations to satisfy …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,38
LSII: An indexing structure for exact real-time search on microblogs,Lingkun Wu; Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao; Yabo Xu,Indexing microblogs for real-time search is challenging given the efficiency issue caused bythe tremendous speed at which new microblogs are created by users. Existing approachesaddress this efficiency issue at the cost of query accuracy; as they either (i) exclude asignificant portion of microblogs from the index to reduce update cost or (ii) rank microblogsmostly by their timestamps (without sufficient consideration of their relevance to the queries)to enable append-only index insertion. As a consequence; the search results returned by theexisting approaches do not satisfy the users who demand timely and high-quality searchresults. To remedy this deficiency; we propose the Log-Structured Inverted Indices (LSII); astructure for exact real-time search on microblogs. The core of LSII is a sequence of invertedindices with exponentially increasing sizes; such that new microblogs are (i) first inserted …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,38
GBLENDER: towards blending visual query formulation and query processing in graph databases,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xiaokui Xiao; James Cheng; Byron Choi,Abstract Given a graph database D and a query graph g; an exact subgraph matching queryasks for the set S of graphs in D that contain g as a subgraph. This type of queries findimportant applications in several domains such as bioinformatics and chemoinformatics;where users are generally not familiar with complex graph query languages. Consequently;user-friendly visual interfaces which support query graph construction can reduce theburden of data retrieval for these users. Existing techniques for subgraph matching queriesbuilt on top of such visual framework are designed to optimize the time required in retrievingthe result set S from D; assuming that the whole query graph has been constructed. Thisleads to sub-optimal system response time as the query processing is initiated only after theuser has finished drawing the query graph. In this paper; we take the first step towards …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,37
Output perturbation with query relaxation,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao,Abstract Given a dataset containing sensitive personal information; a statistical databaseanswers aggregate queries in a manner that preserves individual privacy. We consider theproblem of constructing a statistical database using output perturbation; which protectsprivacy by injecting a small noise into each query result. We show that the state-of-the-artapproach; ε-differential privacy; suffers from two severe deficiencies: it (i) incurs prohibitivecomputation overhead; and (ii) can answer only a limited number of queries; after which thestatistical database has to be shut down. To remedy the problem; we develop a newtechnique that enforces ε-different privacy with economical cost. Our technique alsoincorporates a query relaxation mechanism; which removes the restriction on the number ofpermissible queries. The effectiveness and efficiency of our solution are verified through …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,34
SimApp: A framework for detecting similar mobile applications by online kernel learning,Ning Chen; Steven CH Hoi; Shaohua Li; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract With the popularity of smart phones and mobile devices; the number of mobileapplications (aka" apps") has been growing rapidly. Detecting semantically similar appsfrom a large pool of apps is a basic and important problem; as it is beneficial for variousapplications; such as app recommendation; app search; etc. However; there is no systematicand comprehensive work so far that focuses on addressing this problem. In order to fill thisgap; in this paper; we explore multi-modal heterogeneous data in app markets (eg;description text; images; user reviews; etc.); and present" SimApp"--a novel framework fordetecting similar apps using machine learning. Specifically; it consists of two stages:(i) avariety of kernel functions are constructed to measure app similarity for each modality ofdata; and (ii) an online kernel learning algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2015,32
Reachability queries on large dynamic graphs: a total order approach,Andy Diwen Zhu; Wenqing Lin; Sibo Wang; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Reachability queries are a fundamental type of queries on graphs that findimportant applications in numerous domains. Although a plethora of techniques have beenproposed for reachability queries; most of them require that the input graph is static; ie; theyare inapplicable to the {\em dynamic} graphs (eg; social networks and the Semantic Web)commonly encountered in practice. There exist a few techniques that can handle dynamicgraphs; but none of them can scale to sizable graphs without significant loss of efficiency. Toaddress this deficiency; this paper presents a novel study on reachability indices for largedynamic graphs. We first introduce a general indexing framework that summarizes a familyof reachability indices with the best performance among the existing techniques for staticgraphs. Then; we propose general and efficient algorithms for handling vertex insertions …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,31
Interactive anonymization of sensitive data,Xiaokui Xiao; Guozhang Wang; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract There has been much recent work on algorithms for limiting disclosure in datapublishing; however they have not been put to use in any toolkit for practicioners. We willdemonstrate CAT; the Cornell Anonymization Toolkit; designed for interactiveanonymization. CAT has an interface that is easy to use; it guides users through the processof preparing a dataset for publication while limiting disclosure through the identification ofrecords that have high risk under various attacker models.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,31
Transparent anonymization: Thwarting adversaries who know the algorithm,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao; Nick Koudas,Abstract Numerous generalization techniques have been proposed for privacy-preservingdata publishing. Most existing techniques; however; implicitly assume that the adversaryknows little about the anonymization algorithm adopted by the data publisher.Consequently; they cannot guard against privacy attacks that exploit various characteristicsof the anonymization mechanism. This article provides a practical solution tothis problem.First; we propose an analytical model for evaluating disclosure risks; when an adversaryknows everything in the anonymization process; except the sensitive values. Based on thismodel; we develop a privacy principle; transparent l-diversity; which ensures privacyprotection against such powerful adversaries. We identify three algorithms that achievetransparent l-diversity; and verify their effectiveness and efficiency through extensive …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,30
Private release of graph statistics using ladder functions,Jun Zhang; Graham Cormode; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Protecting the privacy of individuals in graph structured data while making accurateversions of the data available is one of the most challenging problems in data privacy. Mostefforts to date to perform this data release end up mired in complexity; overwhelm the signalwith noise; and are not effective for use in practice. In this paper; we introduce a new methodwhich guarantees differential privacy. It specifies a probability distribution over possibleoutputs that is carefully defined to maximize the utility for the given input; while still providingthe required privacy level. The distribution is designed to form a'ladder'; so that each outputachieves the highest'rung'(maximum probability) compared to less preferable outputs. Weshow how our ladder framework can be applied to problems of counting the number ofoccurrences of subgraphs; a vital objective in graph analysis; and give algorithms whose …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,26
Efficient route planning on public transportation networks: A labelling approach,Sibo Wang; Wenqing Lin; Yi Yang; Xiaokui Xiao; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract A public transportation network can often be modeled as a timetable graph where(i) each node represents a station; and (ii) each directed edge (u; v) is associated with atimetable that records the departure (resp. arrival) time of each vehicle at station u (resp. v).Several techniques have been proposed for various types of route planning on timetablegraphs; eg; retrieving the route from a node to another with the shortest travel time. Thesetechniques; however; either provide insufficient query efficiency or incur significant spaceoverheads. This paper presents Timetable Labelling (TTL); an efficient indexing techniquefor route planning on timetable graphs. The basic idea of TTL is to associate each node $ u$ with a set of labels; each of which records the shortest travel time from u to some othernode v given a certain departure time from u; such labels would then be used during …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,24
Crowd-based deduplication: An adaptive approach,Sibo Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Chun-Hee Lee,Abstract Data deduplication stands as a building block for data integration and datacleaning. The state-of-the-art techniques focus on how to exploit crowdsourcing to improvethe accuracy of deduplication. However; they either incur significant overheads on the crowdor offer inferior accuracy. This paper presents ACD; a new crowd-based algorithm for datadeduplication. The basic idea of ACD is to adopt correlation clustering (which is a classicmachine-based algorithm for data deduplication) under a crowd-based setting. We proposenon-trivial techniques to reduce the time required in performing correlation clustering withthe crowd; and devise methods to postprocess the results of correlation clustering for betteraccuracy of deduplication. With extensive experiments on the Amazon Mechanical Turk; wedemonstrate that ACD outperforms the states of the art by offering a high precision of …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,22
Efficient single-source shortest path and distance queries on large graphs,Andy Diwen Zhu; Xiaokui Xiao; Sibo Wang; Wenqing Lin,Abstract This paper investigates two types of graph queries: single source distance (SSD)queries and single source shortest path (SSSP) queries. Given a node v in a graph G; anSSD query from v asks for the distance from $ v $ to any other node in G; while an SSSPquery retrieves the shortest path from v to any other node. These two types of queries findimportant applications in graph analysis; especially in the computation of graph measures.Most of the existing solutions for SSD and SSSP queries; however; require that the inputgraph fits in the main memory; which renders them inapplicable for the massive disk-resident graphs commonly used in web and social applications. There are severaltechniques that are designed to be I/O efficient; but they all focus on undirected and/orunweighted graphs; and they only offer sub-optimal query efficiency.

Heavy hitter estimation over set-valued data with local differential privacy,Zhan Qin; Yin Yang; Ting Yu; Issa Khalil; Xiaokui Xiao; Kui Ren,Abstract In local differential privacy (LDP); each user perturbs her data locally beforesending the noisy data to a data collector. The latter then analyzes the data to obtain usefulstatistics. Unlike the setting of centralized differential privacy; in LDP the data collector nevergains access to the exact values of sensitive data; which protects not only the privacy of datacontributors but also the collector itself against the risk of potential data leakage. ExistingLDP solutions in the literature are mostly limited to the case that each user possesses atuple of numeric or categorical values; and the data collector computes basic statistics suchas counts or mean values. To the best of our knowledge; no existing work tackles morecomplex data mining tasks such as heavy hitter discovery over set-valued data. In this paper;we present a systematic study of heavy hitter mining under LDP. We first review existing …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,21
Privtree: A differentially private algorithm for hierarchical decompositions,Jun Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Xing Xie,Abstract Given a set D of tuples defined on a domain Omega; we study differentially privatealgorithms for constructing a histogram over Omega to approximate the tuple distribution inD. Existing solutions for the problem mostly adopt a hierarchical decomposition approach;which recursively splits Omega into sub-domains and computes a noisy tuple count for eachsub-domain; until all noisy counts are below a certain threshold. This approach; however;requires that we (i) impose a limit h on the recursion depth in the splitting of Omega and (ii)set the noise in each count to be proportional to h. The choice of h is a serious dilemma: asmall h makes the resulting histogram too coarse-grained; while a large h leads to excessivenoise in the tuple counts used in deciding whether sub-domains should be split.Furthermore; h cannot be directly tuned based on D; otherwise; the choice of h itself …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,18
Obfuscating the topical intention in enterprise text search,Hwee Hwa Pang; Xiaokui Xiao; Jialie Shen,The text search queries in an enterprise can reveal the users' topic of interest; and in turnconfidential staff or business information. To safeguard the enterprise from consequencesarising from a disclosure of the query traces; it is desirable to obfuscate the true userintention from the search engine; without requiring it to be re-engineered. In this paper; weadvocate a unique approach to profile the topics that are relevant to the user intention.Based on this approach; we introduce an (ε 1; ε 2)-privacy model that allows a user tostipulate that topics relevant to her intention at ε 1 level should appear to any adversary to beinnocuous at ε 2 level. We then present a Top Priv algorithm to achieve the customized (ε 1;ε 2)-privacy requirement of individual users through injecting automatically formulated fakequeries. The advantages of Top Priv over existing techniques are confirmed through …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,14
Correlation hiding by independence masking,Yufei Tao; Jian Pei; Jiexing Li; Xiaokui Xiao; Ke Yi; Zhengzheng Xing,Extracting useful correlation from a dataset has been extensively studied. In this paper; wedeal with the opposite; namely; a problem we call correlation hiding (CH); which isfundamental in numerous applications that need to disseminate data containing sensitiveinformation. In this problem; we are given a relational table T whose attributes can beclassified into three disjoint sets A; B; and C. The objective is to distort some values in T sothat A becomes independent from B; and yet; their correlation with C is preserved as muchas possible. CH is different from all the problems studied previously in the area of dataprivacy; in that CH demands complete elimination of the correlation between two sets ofattributes; whereas the previous research focuses on partial elimination up to a certain level.A new operator called independence masking is proposed to solve the CH problem …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,14
Primal or dual: which promises faster spatiotemporal search?,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract The existing predictive spatiotemporal indexes can be classified into twocategories; depending on whether they are based on the primal or dual methodology.Although we have gained considerable empirical knowledge about various access methods;currently there is only limited understanding on the theoretical characteristics of the twomethodologies. In fact; the experimental results in different papers even contradict eachother; regarding the relative superiority of the primal and dual techniques. This paperpresents a careful study on the query performance of general primal and dual indexes; andreveals important insight into the behavior of each technique. In particular; wemathematically establish the conditions that determine the superiority of each methodology;and provide rigorous justification for well-known observations that have not been properly …,The VLDB Journal,2008,14
Recursive neural conditional random fields for aspect-based sentiment analysis,Wenya Wang; Sinno Jialin Pan; Daniel Dahlmeier; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract: In aspect-based sentiment analysis; extracting aspect terms along with theopinions being expressed from user-generated content is one of the most importantsubtasks. Previous studies have shown that exploiting connections between aspect andopinion terms is promising for this task. In this paper; we propose a novel joint model thatintegrates recursive neural networks and conditional random fields into a unified frameworkfor explicit aspect and opinion terms co-extraction. The proposed model learns high-leveldiscriminative features and double propagate information between aspect and opinionterms; simultaneously. Moreover; it is flexible to incorporate hand-crafted features into theproposed model to further boost its information extraction performance. Experimental resultson the SemEval Challenge 2014 dataset show the superiority of our proposed model over …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.06679,2016,13
KORS: Keyword-aware optimal route search system,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Jihong Guan; Nhan-Tue Phan; Xiaokui Xiao,We present the Keyword-aware Optimal Route Search System (KORS); which efficientlyanswers the KOR queries. A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint is satisfied; and an objective score of theroute is optimized. Consider a tourist who wants to spend a day exploring a city. The usermay issue the following KOR query:“find the most popular route such that it passes byshopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4hours.” KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers andprovides a client application for mobile devices as well. The interfaces and the client enableusers to formulate queries and view the query results on a map. Queries are then sent to theserver for processing by the HTTP post operation. Since answering a KOR query is NP …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,13
Software process evaluation: A machine learning approach,Ning Chen; Steven CH Hoi; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Software process evaluation is essential to improve software development and thequality of software products in an organization. Conventional approaches based on manualqualitative evaluations (eg; artifacts inspection) are deficient in the sense that (i) they aretime-consuming;(ii) they suffer from the authority constraints; and (iii) they are oftensubjective. To overcome these limitations; this paper presents a novel semi-automatedapproach to software process evaluation using machine learning techniques. In particular;we formulate the problem as a sequence classification task; which is solved by applyingmachine learning algorithms. Based on the framework; we define a new quantitativeindicator to objectively evaluate the quality and performance of a software process. Tovalidate the efficacy of our approach; we apply it to evaluate the defect management …,Proceedings of the 2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,2011,13
Privacy preserving publishing on multiple quasi-identifiers,Jian Pei; Yufei Tao; Jiexing Li; Xiaokui Xiao,In some applications of privacy preserving data publishing; a practical demand is to publisha data set on multiple quasi-identifiers for multiple users simultaneously; which posesseveral challenges. Can we generate one anonymized version of the data so that theprivacy preservation requirement like $ k $-anonymity is satisfied for all users and theinformation loss is reduced as much as possible?

Mobile app tagging,Ning Chen; Steven CH Hoi; Shaohua Li; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Mobile app tagging aims to assign a list of keywords indicating core functionalities;main contents; key features or concepts of a mobile app. Mobile app tags can be potentiallyuseful for app ecosystem stakeholders or other parties to improve app search; browsing;categorization; and advertising; etc. However; most mainstream app markets; eg; GooglePlay; Apple App Store; etc.; currently do not explicitly support such tags for apps. To addressthis problem; we propose a novel auto mobile app tagging framework for annotating a givenmobile app automatically; which is based on a search-based annotation paradigm poweredby machine learning techniques. Specifically; given a novel query app without tags; ourproposed framework (i) first explores online kernel learning techniques to retrieve a set oftop-N similar apps that are semantically most similar to the query app from a large app …,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,12
Towards maximum independent sets on massive graphs,Yu Liu; Jiaheng Lu; Hua Yang; Xiaokui Xiao; Zhewei Wei,Abstract Maximum independent set (MIS) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and ithas important applications in many areas such as social network analysis; graphicalinformation systems and coding theory. The problem is NP-hard; and there has beennumerous studies on its approximate solutions. While successful to a certain degree; theexisting methods require memory space at least linear in the size of the input graph. Thishas become a serious concern in view of the massive volume of today's fast-growing graphs.In this paper; we study the MIS problem under the semi-external setting; which assumes thatthe main memory can accommodate all vertices of the graph but not all edges. We present agreedy algorithm and a general vertex-swap framework; which swaps vertices toincrementally increase the size of independent sets.

An efficient algorithm for mapping vehicle trajectories onto road networks,Youze Tang; Andy Diwen Zhu; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Modern mobile technology has enabled the collection of large scale vehicletrajectories using GPS devices. As GPS measurements may come with error; vehicletrajectories are often noisy. A common practice to alleviate this issue is to apply map-matching; ie; to align vehicle trajectories with the road segments in a digitized road network.This paper presents an efficient solution for map-matching problem that won theSIGSPATIAL CUP 2012. Given a road network; our solution first constructs a gird index onthe road segments. For each point p on a vehicle trajectory; we employ the index to identify acandidate set of road segments that are close to p; and then we refine the candidate set toselect a segment that matches p with the highest probability. The selection of the best matchis based on a metric that takes into account (i) the correlation between consecutive GPS …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,10
Keyword-aware continuous knn query on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Han Su; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,It is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices;which describe auxiliary information (eg; business; traffic; etc.) associated with the vertex. Insuch road networks; which are modelled as weighted undirected graphs; each vertex isassociated with one or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight; which canbe its physical length or travelling time. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword-aware continuous k nearest neighbour (KCkNN) search on road networks; which computesthe k nearest vertices that contain the query keywords issued by a moving object andmaintains the results continuously as the object is moving on the road network.

Optimizing batch linear queries under exact and approximate differential privacy,Ganzhao Yuan; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Differential privacy is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for statistical queryprocessing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random noise into each query resultsuch that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of anyindividual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially privatequery processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results while satisfying the privacyguarantees. Previous work; notably Li et al.[2010]; has suggested that; with an appropriatestrategy; processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole achieves considerably higheraccuracy than answering them individually. However; to our knowledge there is currently nopractical solution to find such a strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods eitherreturn strategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require prohibitively …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,8
Deterministic identification of specific individuals from GWAS results,Ruichu Cai; Zhifeng Hao; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are commonly applied onhuman genomic data to understand the causal gene combinations statistically connected tocertain diseases. Patients involved in these GWASs could be re-identified when the studiesrelease statistical information on a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.Subsequent work; however; found that such privacy attacks are theoretically possible butunsuccessful and unconvincing in real settings. Results: We derive the first practical privacyattack that can successfully identify specific individuals from limited published associationsfrom the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) dataset. For GWAS resultscomputed over 25 randomly selected loci; our algorithm always pinpoints at least onepatient from the WTCCC dataset. Moreover; the number of re-identified patients grows …,Bioinformatics,2015,8

Efficient algorithms for generalized subgraph query processing,Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao; James Cheng; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract We study a new type of graph queries; which injectively maps its edges to paths ofthe graphs in a given database; where the length of each path is constrained by a giventhreshold specified by the weight of the corresponding matching edge. We give importantapplications of the new graph query and identify new challenges of processing such aquery. Then; we devise the cost model of the branch-and-bound algorithm framework forprocessing the graph query; and propose an efficient algorithm to minimize the costoverhead. We also develop three indexing techniques to efficiently answer the queriesonline. Finally; we verify the efficiency of our proposed indexes with extensive experimentson large real and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,8
GBLENDER: visual subgraph query formulation meets query processing,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xiaokui Xiao; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Due to the complexity of graph query languages; the need for visual queryinterfaces that can reduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading ofgraph data management tools to wider community. We present a novel HCI (human-computer interaction)-aware graph query processing paradigm; where instead of processinga query graph after its construction; it interleaves visual query construction and processing toimprove system response time. We demonstrate a system called GBLENDER that exploitsGUI latency to prune false results and prefetch candidate data graphs by employing a novelaction-aware indexing scheme and a data structure called spindle-shaped graphs (SPIG).We demonstrate various innovative features of GBLENDER and its promising performancein evaluating subgraph containment and similarity queries.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,8
Collecting and analyzing data from smart device users with local differential privacy,Thông T Nguyên; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Siu Cheung Hui; Hyejin Shin; Junbum Shin,Abstract: Organizations with a large user base; such as Samsung and Google; canpotentially benefit from collecting and mining users' data. However; doing so raises privacyconcerns; and risks accidental privacy breaches with serious consequences. Localdifferential privacy (LDP) techniques address this problem by only collecting randomizedanswers from each user; with guarantees of plausible deniability; meanwhile; the aggregatorcan still build accurate models and predictors by analyzing large amounts of suchrandomized data. So far; existing LDP solutions either have severely restricted functionality;or focus mainly on theoretical aspects such as asymptotical bounds rather than practicalusability and performance. Motivated by this; we propose Harmony; a practical; accurate andefficient system for collecting and analyzing data from smart device users; while satisfying …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05053,2016,7
Revisiting the stop-and-stare algorithms for influence maximization,Keke Huang; Sibo Wang; Glenn Bevilacqua; Xiaokui Xiao; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Influence maximization is a combinatorial optimization problem that finds importantapplications in viral marketing; feed recommendation; etc. Recent research has led to anumber of scalable approximation algorithms for influence maximization; such as TIM+ andIMM; and more recently; SSA and D-SSA. The goal of this paper is to conduct a rigoroustheoretical and experimental analysis of SSA and D-SSA and compare them against thepreceding algorithms. In doing so; we uncover inaccuracies in previously reported technicalresults on the accuracy and efficiency of SSA and D-SSA; which we set right. We alsoattempt to reproduce the original experiments on SSA and D-SSA; based on which weprovide interesting empirical insights.

Coupled Multi-Layer Attentions for Co-Extraction of Aspect and Opinion Terms.,Wenya Wang; Sinno Jialin Pan; Daniel Dahlmeier; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract The task of aspect and opinion terms co-extraction aims to explicitly extract aspectterms describing features of an entity and opinion terms expressing emotions from user-generated texts. To achieve this task; one effective approach is to exploit relations betweenaspect terms and opinion terms by parsing syntactic structure for each sentence. However;this approach requires expensive effort for parsing and highly depends on the quality of theparsing results. In this paper; we offer a novel deep learning model; named coupled multi-layer attentions. The proposed model provides an end-to-end solution and does not requireany parsers or other linguistic resources for preprocessing. Specifically; the proposed modelis a multilayer attention network; where each layer consists of a couple of attentions withtensor operators. One attention is for extracting aspect terms; while the other is for …,AAAI,2017,6
Dynamic monitoring of optimal locations in road network databases,Bin Yao; Xiaokui Xiao; Feifei Li; Yifan Wu,Abstract Optimal location (OL) queries are a type of spatial queries that are particularlyuseful for the strategic planning of resources. Given a set of existing facilities and a set ofclients; an OL query asks for a location to build a new facility that optimizes a certain costmetric (defined based on the distances between the clients and the facilities). Severaltechniques have been proposed to address OL queries; assuming that all clients andfacilities reside in an L_p L p space. In practice; however; movements between spatiallocations are usually confined by the underlying road network; and hence; the actualdistance between two locations can differ significantly from their L_p L p distance. Motivatedby the deficiency of the existing techniques; this paper presents a comprehensive study onOL queries in road networks. We propose a unified framework that addresses three …,The VLDB Journal,2014,6
Efficient temporal counting with bounded error,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract This paper studies aggregate search in transaction time databases. Specifically;each object in such a database can be modeled as a horizontal segment; whose y-projection is its search key; and its x-projection represents the period when the key was validin history. Given a query timestamp qt and a key range $ $\vec {q_k} $ $; a count-queryretrieves the number of objects that are alive at qt; and their keys fall in $ $\vec {q_k} $ $. Weprovide a method that accurately answers such queries; with error less than $ $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\varepsilon\cdot N_ {\rm alive}(q_t) $ $; where N alive (qt) is the number ofobjects alive at time qt; and¿ is any constant in (0; 1].

Network motif discovery: A GPU approach,Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao; Xing Xie; Xiao-Li Li,The identification of network motifs has important applications in numerous domains; suchas pattern detection in biological networks and graph analysis in digital circuits. However;mining network motifs is computationally challenging; as it requires enumerating subgraphsfrom a real-life graph; and computing the frequency of each subgraph in a large number ofrandom graphs. In particular; existing solutions often require days to derive network motifsfrom biological networks with only a few thousand vertices. To address this problem; thispaper presents a novel study on network motif discovery using Graphical Processing Units(GPUs). The basic idea is to employ GPUs to parallelize a large number of subgraphmatching tasks in computing subgraph frequencies from random graphs; so as to reduce theoverall computation time of network motif discovery. We explore the design space of GPU …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,5
Effective indexing for approximate constrained shortest path queries on large road networks,Sibo Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Wenqing Lin,Abstract In a constrained shortest path (CSP) query; each edge in the road network isassociated with both a length and a cost. Given an origin s; a destination t; and a costconstraint θ; the goal is to find the shortest path from s to t whose total cost does not exceedθ. Because exact CSP is NP-hard; previous work mostly focuses on approximate solutions.Even so; existing methods are still prohibitively expensive for large road networks. Two mainreasons are (i) that they fail to utilize the special properties of road networks and (ii) thatmost of them process queries without indices; the few existing indices consume largeamounts of memory and yet have limited effectiveness in reducing query costs. Motivated bythis; we propose COLA; the first practical solution for approximate CSP processing on largeroad networks. COLA exploits the facts that a road network can be effectively partitioned …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,5
Sling: A near-optimal index structure for SimRank,Boyu Tian; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract SimRank is a similarity measure for graph nodes that has numerous applications inpractice. Scalable SimRank computation has been the subject of extensive research formore than a decade; and yet; none of the existing solutions can efficiently derive SimRankscores on large graphs with provable accuracy guarantees. In particular; the state-of-the-artsolution requires up to a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs;and does not offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error. This paper presentsSLING; an efficient index structure for SimRank computation. SLING guarantees that eachSimRank score returned has at most ε additive error; and it answers any single-pair andsingle-source SimRank queries in O (1/ε) and O (n/ε) time; respectively. These timecomplexities are near-optimal; and are significantly better than the asymptotic bounds of …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,5
Differentially private data release: Improving utility with wavelets and bayesian networks,Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publishing is an important problem that has been the focusof extensive study. The state-of-the-art privacy model for this problem is differential privacy;which offers a strong degree of privacy protection without making restrictive assumptionsabout the adversary. In this paper; we review two methods; Privelet and PrivBayes; forimproving utility in differentially private data publishing. Privelet utilizes wavelet transforms toensure that any range-count query can be answered with noise variance that ispolylogarithmic to the size of the input data domain. Meanwhile; PrivBayes employsBayesian networks to publish high-dimensional datasets without incurring prohibitivecomputation overheads or excessive noise injection.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2014,4
HubPPR: effective indexing for approximate personalized pagerank,Sibo Wang; Youze Tang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zengxiang Li,Abstract Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation is a fundamental operation in websearch; social networks; and graph analysis. Given a graph G; a source s; and a target t; thePPR query Π (s; t) returns the probability that a random walk on G starting from s terminatesat t. Unlike global PageRank which can be effectively pre-computed and materialized; thePPR result depends on both the source and the target; rendering results materializationinfeasible for large graphs. Existing indexing techniques have rather limited effectiveness; infact; the current state-of-the-art solution; BiPPR; answers individual PPR queries without pre-computation or indexing; and yet it outperforms all previous index-based solutions.Motivated by this; we propose HubPPR; an effective indexing scheme for PPR computationwith controllable tradeoffs for accuracy; query time; and memory consumption.

Practical private shortest path computation based on oblivious storage,Dong Xie; Guanru Li; Bin Yao; Xuan Wei; Xiaokui Xiao; Yunjun Gao; Minyi Guo,As location-based services (LBSs) become popular; location-dependent queries haveraised serious privacy concerns since they may disclose sensitive information in queryprocessing. Among typical queries supported by LBSs; shortest path queries may revealinformation about not only current locations of the clients; but also their potential destinationsand travel plans. Unfortunately; existing methods for private shortest path computation sufferfrom issues of weak privacy property; low performance or poor scalability. In this paper; weaim at a strong privacy guarantee; where the adversary cannot infer almost any informationabout the queries; with better performance and scalability. To achieve this goal; weintroduce a general system model based on the concept of Oblivious Storage (OS); whichcan deal with queries requiring strong privacy properties. Furthermore; we propose a new …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,3
Boosting the quality of approximate string matching by synonyms,Jiaheng Lu; Chunbin Lin; Wei Wang; Chen Li; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract A string-similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings forapproximate string matching or comparison. For example; the strings “Sam” and “Samuel”can be considered to be similar. Most existing work that computes the similarity of two stringsonly considers syntactic similarities; for example; number of common words or q-grams.While this is indeed an indicator of similarity; there are many important cases wheresyntactically-different strings can represent the same real-world object. For example;“Bill” isa short form of “William;” and “Database Management Systems” can be abbreviated as“DBMS.” Given a collection of predefined synonyms; the purpose of this article is to exploresuch existing knowledge to effectively evaluate the similarity between two strings andefficiently perform similarity searches and joins; thereby boosting the quality of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,2

Graphh: High performance big graph analytics in small clusters,Peng Sun; Yonggang Wen; Ta Nguyen Binh Duong; Xiaokui Xiao,It is common for real-world applications to analyze big graphs using distributed graphprocessing systems. Popular in-memory systems require an enormous amount of resourcesto handle big graphs. While several out-of-core approaches have been proposed forprocessing big graphs on disk; the high disk I/O overhead could significantly reduceperformance. In this paper; we propose GraphH to enable high-performance big graphanalytics in small clusters. Specifically; we design a two-stage graph partition scheme toevenly divide the input graph into partitions; and propose a GAB (Gather-Apply-Broadcast)computation model to make each worker process a partition in memory at a time. We use anedge cache mechanism to reduce the disk I/O overhead; and design a hybrid strategy toimprove the communication performance.

GraphMP: An Efficient Semi-External-Memory Big Graph Processing System on a Single Machine,Peng Sun; Yonggang Wen; Ta Nguyen Binh Duong; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract: Recent studies showed that single-machine graph processing systems can be ashighly competitive as cluster-based approaches on large-scale problems. While several out-of-core graph processing systems and computation models have been proposed; the highdisk I/O overhead could significantly reduce performance in many practical cases. In thispaper; we propose GraphMP to tackle big graph analytics on a single machine. GraphMPachieves low disk I/O overhead with three techniques. First; we design a vertex-centricsliding window (VSW) computation model to avoid reading and writing vertices on disk.Second; we propose a selective scheduling method to skip loading and processingunnecessary edge shards on disk. Third; we use a compressed edge cache mechanism tofully utilize the available memory of a machine to reduce the amount of disk accesses for …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.02557,2017,1
PrivSuper: A superset-first approach to frequent itemset mining under differential privacy,Ning Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Yu Gu; Ge Yu,Differential privacy; which has been applied in Google Chrome and Apple iOS; providesstrong privacy assurance to users while retaining the capability to discover statisticalpatterns from sensitive data. We focus on top-k frequent itemset mining on sensitive data;with the goal of obtaining high result utility while satisfying differential privacy. There are twobasic methodologies to design a high-utility solution: one uses generic differential privacymechanisms as building blocks; and minimizes result error through algorithm design. Mostexisting work follows this approach. The other methodology is to devise a new building blockcustomized for frequent itemset mining. This is much more challenging: to our knowledge;only one recent work; NoisyCut; attempts to do so; unfortunately; Noisycut has been found toviolate differential privacy.

M-Invariance,Xiaokui Xiao,Electronic information stored and processed in computers and transferred overcommunication networks is vulnerable to both passive and active attacks. In a passiveattack; the opponent tries to obtain information on the data sent; in an active attack; theopponent will attempt to modify the information itself; the claimed sender; and/or intendedrecipient. Cryptographic techniques for information authentication focus on the origin of thedata (data origin authentication) and on the integrity of the data; that is; the fact that the datahas not been modified. Other aspects that can be important are the timeliness; the sequencewith respect to other messages; and the intended recipient (s). Information authentication isparticularly relevant in the context of financial transactions and electronic commerce. Otherapplications where information authentication plays an important role are alarm systems …,Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security,2011,1
Fast Matching of Detour Routes and Service Areas,Siqiang Luo; Reynold Cheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Ben Kao; Shuigeng Zhou; Jiafeng Hu,Abstract—Novel road-network services; such as ride sharing; spatial crowdsourcing andkeyword-aware routing often need to find out whether there exists a route that can gothrough (or match) a service area. A ride-sharing system; for instance; may need to find for amoving taxi a route that passes through a region in which a passenger is located. Afundamental question is: given two locations s and t; and an area A on the road network; isthere a “reasonably short” route from s to t that also crosses A? This Route and AreaMatching (ROAM) query is important as 1) its efficient evaluation allows the applicationinvolved to recommend appropriate services to objects in an online manner; 2) its algorithmcan be incorporated into some sophisticated systems to optimize their performance. Despiteits importance; the ROAM query has not been well studied especially when “service area” …,*,*,1
Persisting RB-Tree into NVM in a Consistency Perspective,Chundong Wang; Qingsong Wei; Lingkun Wu; Sibo Wang; Cheng Chen; Xiaokui Xiao; Jun Yang; Mingdi Xue; Yechao Yang,Abstract Byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) is going to reshape conventionalcomputer systems. With advantages of low latency; byte-addressability; and non-volatility;NVM can be directly put on the memory bus to replace DRAM. As a result; both system andapplication softwares have to be adjusted to perceive the fact that the persistent layer movesup to the memory. However; most of the current in-memory data structures will beproblematic with consistency issues if not well tuned with NVM. This article places emphasison an important in-memory structure that is widely used in computer systems; ie; theRed/Black-tree (RB-tree). Since it has a long and complicated update process; the RB-tree isprone to inconsistency problems with NVM. This article presents an NVM-compatibleconsistent RB-tree with a new technique named cascade-versioning. The proposed RB …,ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS),2018,*
Privacy Enhanced Matrix Factorization for Recommendation with Local Differential Privacy,Hyejin Shin; Sungwook Kim; Junbum Shin; Xiaokui Xiao,Recommender systems are collecting and analyzing user data to provide better userexperience. However; several privacy concerns have been raised when a recommenderknows user's set of items or their ratings. A number of solutions have been suggested toimprove privacy of legacy recommender systems; but the existing solutions in the literaturecan protect either items or ratings only. In this paper; we propose a recommender systemthat protects both user's items and ratings. We develop novel matrix factorization algorithmsunder local differential privacy (LDP). In a recommender system with LDP; individual usersrandomize their data themselves to satisfy differential privacy and send the perturbed data tothe recommender. Then; the recommender computes aggregates of the perturbed data. Thisframework ensures that both user's items and ratings remain private from the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*
Influence Maximization in Online Social Networks,Cigdem Aslay; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Wei Lu; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Starting with the earliest studies showing that the spread of new trends; information;and innovations is closely related to the social influence exerted on people by their socialnetworks; the research on social influence theory took off; providing remarkable evidence onsocial influence induced viral phenomena. Fueled by the extreme popularity of online socialnetworks and social media; computational social influence has emerged as a subfield ofdata mining whose goal is to analyze and optimize social influence using computationalframeworks such as algorithm design and theoretical modeling. One of the fundamentalproblems in this field is the problem of influence maximization; primarily motivated by theapplication of viral marketing. The objective is to identify a small set of users in a socialnetwork who; when convinced to adopt a product; shall influence others in the network in …,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2018,*
Optimal algorithms for selecting top-k combinations of attributes: theory and applications,Chunbin Lin; Jiaheng Lu; Zhewei Wei; Jianguo Wang; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Traditional top-k algorithms; eg; TA and NRA; have been successfully applied inmany areas such as information retrieval; data mining and databases. They are designed todiscover k objects; eg; top-k restaurants; with highest overall scores aggregated fromdifferent attributes; eg; price and location. However; new emerging applications like queryrecommendation require providing the best combinations of attributes; instead of objects.The straightforward extension based on the existing top-k algorithms is prohibitivelyexpensive to answer top-k combinations because they need to enumerate all the possiblecombinations; which is exponential to the number of attributes. In this article; we formalize anovel type of top-k query; called top-k; m; which aims to find top-k combinations of attributesbased on the overall scores of the top-m objects within each combination; where m is the …,The VLDB Journal,2018,*
Generating Synthetic Decentralized Social Graphs with Local Differential Privacy,Zhan Qin; Ting Yu; Yin Yang; Issa Khalil; Xiaokui Xiao; Kui Ren,Abstract A large amount of valuable information resides in decentralized social graphs;where no entity has access to the complete graph structure. Instead; each user maintainslocally a limited view of the graph. For example; in a phone network; each user keeps acontact list locally in her phone; and does not have access to other users' contacts. Thecontact lists of all users form an implicit social graph that could be very useful to study theinteraction patterns among different populations. However; due to privacy concerns; onecould not simply collect the unfettered local views from users and reconstruct adecentralized social network. In this paper; we investigate techniques to ensure localdifferential privacy of individuals while collecting structural information and generatingrepresentative synthetic social graphs. We show that existing local differential privacy and …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2017,*
Efficient nonparametric and asymptotic Bayesian model selection methods for attributed graph clustering,Zhiqiang Xu; James Cheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Ryohei Fujimaki; Yusuke Muraoka,Abstract Attributed graph clustering; also known as community detection on attributedgraphs; attracts much interests recently due to the ubiquity of attributed graphs in real life.Many existing algorithms have been proposed for this problem; which are either distancebased or model based. However; model selection in attributed graph clustering has notbeen well addressed; that is; most existing algorithms assume the cluster number to beknown a priori. In this paper; we propose two efficient approaches for attributed graphclustering with automatic model selection. The first approach is a popular Bayesiannonparametric method; while the second approach is an asymptotic method based on arecently proposed model selection criterion; factorized information criterion. Experimentalresults on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approaches for attributed …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2017,*
Probesim: scalable single-source and top-k simrank computations on dynamic graphs,Yu Liu; Bolong Zheng; Xiaodong He; Zhewei Wei; Xiaokui Xiao; Kai Zheng; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Single-source and top-k SimRank queries are two important types of similaritysearch in graphs with numerous applications in web mining; social network analysis; spamdetection; etc. A plethora of techniques have been proposed for these two types of queries;but very few can efficiently support similarity search over large dynamic graphs; due to eithersignificant preprocessing time or large space overheads. This paper presents ProbeSim; anindex-free algorithm for single-source and top-k SimRank queries that provides a non-trivialtheoretical guarantee in the absolute error of query results. ProbeSim estimates SimRanksimilarities without precomputing any indexing structures; and thus can naturally supportreal-time SimRank queries on dynamic graphs. Besides the theoretical guarantee;ProbeSim also offers satisfying practical efficiency and effectiveness due to non-trivial …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*
FORA: Simple and Effective Approximate Single-Source Personalized PageRank,Sibo Wang; Renchi Yang; Xiaokui Xiao; Zhewei Wei; Yin Yang,Abstract Given a graph G; a source node s and a target node t; the personalized PageRank(PPR) of t with respect to s is the probability that a random walk starting from s terminates att. A single-source PPR (SSPPR) query enumerates all nodes in G; and returns the top-knodes with the highest PPR values with respect to a given source node s. SSPPR hasimportant applications in web search and social networks; eg; in Twitter's Who-To-Followrecommendation service. However; SSPPR computation is immensely expensive; and at thesame time resistant to indexing and materialization. So far; existing solutions either useheuristics; which do not guarantee result quality; or rely on the strong computing power ofmodern data centers; which is costly. Motivated by this; we propose FORA; a simple andeffective index-based solution for approximate SSPPR processing; with rigorous …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*

In the process; theycontradict several published results; and claim to have unearthed and debunked several"myths" that existed around the research of influence maximization. It is the goal of this articleto examine their claims objectively and critically; and refute the erroneous ones.

An Iterative Algorithm for Graph De-anonymization,Jun Zhang; Youze Tang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett,ABSTRACT The availability of social network data is indispensable for numerous types ofresearch. Nevertheless; data owners are often reluctant to release social network data; asthe release may reveal the private information of the individuals involved in the data. Toaddress this problem; several techniques have been proposed to anonymize socialnetworks for privacy preserving publications. To evaluate the privacy protection of existingtechniques; this paper presents an algorithm designed for de-anonymizing the anonymizedgraphs produced by the existing techniques. With experiments on a large set of anonymizedgraphs generated by the existing techniques; we demonstrate that our algorithm can re-identify a large portion of individuals in many anonymized graphs; which sheds light on theireffectiveness and relative superiority.,*,*,*
