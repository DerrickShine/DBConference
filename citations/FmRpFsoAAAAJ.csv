Logic programming and databases,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,The topic of logic programming and databases. has gained in creasing interest in recentyears. Several events have marked the rapid evolution of this field: the selection; by theJapanese Fifth Generation Project; of Prolog and of the relational data model as the basis forthe development of new machine archi tectures; the focusing of research in database theoryon logic queries and on recursive query processing; and the pragmatic; application-orienteddevelopment of expert database systems and of knowledge-base systems. As a result; anenormous amount of work has been produced in the recent literature; coupled with thespontaneous growth of several advanced projects in this area. The goal of this book is topresent a systematic overview of a rapidly evolving discipline; which is presently notdescribed with the same approach in other books.

What you always wanted to know about Datalog (and never dared to ask),Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Datalog; a database query language based on the logic programming paradigm; isdescribed. The syntax and semantics of Datalog and its use for querying a relationaldatabase are presented. Optimization methods for achieving efficient evaluations of Datalogqueries are classified; and the most relevant methods are presented. Various improvementsof Datalog currently under study are discussed; and what is still needed in order to extendDatalog's applicability to the solution of real-life problems is indicated.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1989,636
XML-GL: a graphical language for querying and restructuring XML documents1,Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Ernesto Damiani; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The growing acceptance of XML as a standard for semi-structured documents onthe Web opens up challenging opportunities for Web query languages. In this paper weintroduce XML-GL; a graphical query language for XML documents. The use of a visualformalism for representing both the content of XML documents (and of their DTDs) and thesyntax and semantics of queries enables an intuitive expression of queries; even when theyare rather complex. XML-GL is inspired by G-log; a general purpose; logic-based languagefor querying structured and semi-structured data. The paper presents the basic capabilitiesof XML-GL through a sequence of examples of increasing complexity.,Computer networks,1999,405
A data-oriented survey of context models,Cristiana Bolchini; Carlo A Curino; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Context-aware systems are pervading everyday life; therefore context modeling isbecoming a relevant issue and an expanding research field. This survey has the goal toprovide a comprehensive evaluation framework; allowing application designers to comparecontext models with respect to a given target application; in particular we stress the analysisof those features which are relevant for the problem of data tailoring. The contribution of thispaper is twofold: a general analysis framework for context models and an up-to-datecomparison of the most interesting; data-oriented approaches available in the literature.,ACM Sigmod Record,2007,376
Integrating object-oriented data modelling with a rule-based programming paradigm,Filippo Cacace; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Crespi-Reghizzi; Letizia Tanca; Roberto Zicari,Abstract LOGRES is a new project for the development of extended database systems whichis based on the integration of the object-oriented data modelling paradigm and of the rule-based approach for the specification of queries and updates. The data model supportsgeneralization hierarchies and object sharing; the rule-based language extends Datalog tosupport generalized type constructors (sets; multisets; and sequences); rule-based integrityconstraints are automatically produced by analyzing schema definitions. Modularization is afundamental feature; as modules encapsulate queries and updates; when modules areapplied to a LOGRES database; their side effects can be controlled. The LOGRES project isa follow-up of the ALGRES project; and takes advantage of the ALGRES programmingenvironment for the development of a fast prototype.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1990,216
Automatic generation of production rules for integrity maintenance,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this article we present an approach to integrity maintenance; consisting ofautomatically generating production rules for integrity enforcement. Constraints areexpressed as particular formulas of Domain Relational Calculus; they are automaticallytranslated into a set of repair actions; encoded as production rules of an active databasesystem. Production rules may be redundant (they enforce the same constraint in differentways) and conflicting (because repairing one constraint may cause the violation of anotherconstraint). Thus; it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing the properties of the setof active rules and for ensuring that any computation of production rules after any incorrecttransaction terminates and produces a consistent database state. Along these guidelines;we describe a specific architecture for constraint definition and enforcement. The …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1994,202
G-Log: A graph-based query language,Jan Paredaens; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,We introduce G-Log; a declarative query language based on graphs; which combines theexpressive power of logic; the modeling power of complex objects with identity and therepresentation power of graphs. G-Log is a nondeterministic complete query language; andthus allows the expression of a large variety of queries. We compare G-Log to well-knowndeductive database languages; and find that it is the only nondeterministic andcomputationally complete language that does not suffer from the copy-elimination problem.G-Log may be used in a totally declarative way; as well as in a" more procedural" way. Thus;it provides an intuitive; flexible graph-based formalism for nonexpert database users.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1995,151
A structured approach for the definition of the semantics of active databases,Piero Fraternali; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Active DBMSs couple database technology with rule-based programming toachieve the capability of reaction to database (and possibly external) stimuli; called events.The reactive capabilities of active databases are useful for a wide spectrum of applications;including security; view materialization; integrity checking and enforcement; orheterogeneous database integration; which makes this technology very promising for thenear future. An active database system consists of a (passive) database and a set of activerules; the most popular form of active rule is the so-called event-condition-action (ECA) rule;which specifies an action to be executed upon the occurrence of one or more events;provided that a condition holds. Several active database systems and prototypes have beendesigned and partially or completely implemented. Unfortunately; they have been …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1995,117

A methodology for a very small data base design,Cristiana Bolchini; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract This paper proposes a design methodology for very small databases for thepurpose of being hosted by portable devices. Three main differences wrt the traditionaldesign methodologies are introduced: first; the main mobility issues are considered alongwith data distribution; second; context awareness is included in the data design issues toallow full exploitation of context-sensitive application functionalities; and third; thepeculiarities of the storage device (s) are taken into account by introducing a logistic phaseafter the usual conceptual and logical phases. The three aspects together determine theVSDB ambient which is the set of personal and environmental characteristics determiningthe portion of data that must be stored on the portable device.

Context integration for mobile data tailoring,Cristiana Bolchini; Carlo Curino; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Independent; heterogeneous; distributed; sometimes transient and mobile data sourcesproduce an enormous amount of information that should be semantically integrated andfiltered; or; as we say; tailored; based on the user's interests and context. Since both the userand the data sources can be mobile; and the communication might be unreliable; cachingthe information on the user device may become really useful. Therefore new challengeshave to be faced such as: data filtering in a context-aware fashion; integration of not-known-in-advance data sources; automatic extraction of the semantics. We propose a novel systemnamed Context-ADDICT (Context-Aware Data Design; Integration; Customization andTailoring) able to deal with the described scenario. The system we are designing aims attailoring the available information to the needs of the current user in the current context; in …,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

Context information for knowledge reshaping,Cristiana Bolchini; Carlo Aldo Curino; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,More and more often; we face the necessity of extracting appropriately reshaped knowledgefrom an integrated representation of the information space. Be such a global representationa central database; a global view of several ones or an ontological representation of aninformation domain; we face the need to define personalised views for the knowledgestakeholders: single users; companies or applications. We propose exploiting theinformation usage context within a methodology for context-aware data design; where thenotion of context is formally defined together with its role within the process of view buildingby information tailoring. This paper presents our context model; called the context dimensiontree; which plays a fundamental role in tailoring the information space according to userinformation needs.,International Journal of Web Engineering and Technology,2009,56
CARVE: Context-aware automatic view definition over relational databases,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Classical database design strategies; based on the a priori definition of applicationviews to be finally integrated in the design of the global databases; are not appropriate forthe design needs of modern; highly dynamic information systems. This paper presentsCARVE (Context-Aware Relational View dEfinition); a methodology for context-aware viewdefinition; well-suited for the design of modern; dynamic applications that; in differentenvironments and situations; need to access different portions of data. The methodologicalapproach includes a context-design phase; followed by a phase when each of the possibleapplication contexts is automatically associated with its relevant part of information (context-aware view). Accordingly; CARVE is based on a context model; on guidelines to definepartial views related to components of the context; and on a set of operators used to …,Information Systems,2013,53
Data mining for XML query-answering support,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Extracting information from semistructured documents is a very hard task; and is going tobecome more and more critical as the amount of digital information available on the Internetgrows. Indeed; documents are often so large that the data set returned as answer to a querymay be too big to convey interpretable knowledge. In this paper; we describe an approachbased on Tree-Based Association Rules (TARs): mined rules; which provide approximate;intensional information on both the structure and the contents of Extensible MarkupLanguage (XML) documents; and can be stored in XML format as well. This minedknowledge is later used to provide: 1) a concise idea-the gist-of both the structure and thecontent of the XML document and 2) quick; approximate answers to queries. In this paper;we focus on the second feature. A prototype system and experimental results …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,48
A methodology for preference-based personalization of contextual data,Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The widespread use of mobile appliances; with limitations in terms of storage;power; and connectivity capability; requires to minimize the amount of data to be loaded onuser's devices; in order to quickly select only the information that is really relevant for theusers in their current contexts: in such a scenario; specific methodologies and techniquesfocused on data reduction must be applied. We propose an extension to the data tailoringapproach of Context-ADDICT; whose aim is to dynamically hook and integrateheterogeneous data to be stored on small; possibly mobile devices. The main goal of ourextension is to personalize the context-dependent data obtained by means of the Context-ADDICT methodology; by allowing the user to express preferences that specify which datas/he is more interested in (and which not) in each specific context.

Blind queries to XML data,Ernesto Damiani; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A flexible query model is presented for well-formed XML documents. Our approachrelies on modeling XML documents as labeled graphs and selectively extending theirstructure by computing fuzzy estimates of the importance of the information they provide; atthe granularity of XML tags. The result of such an extension is a fuzzy labeled graph. Queryresults are subgraphs of this fuzzy labeled graph; presented as a ranked list according totheir degree of matching to the user query.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2000,46
G-Log: A declarative graphical query language,Jan Paredaens; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this paper we introduce G-Log; a declarative graphical query language whichcombines of the expressive power of logic; the modelling power of objectorientedness andthe representation power of graphs. As in the case of prolog; G-Log may be used in a totallydeclarative way; as well as in a “more procedural” way. Furthermore; it provides an intuitiveand flexible graphical tool for non-expert database users. We prove that G-Log is a graphicalequivalent of the first order predicate calculus. Finally; we study its features as a non-deterministic language and compare it with other existing non-deterministic languages.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1991,45
Answering XML queries by means of data summaries,Elena Baralis; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract XML is a rather verbose representation of semistructured data; which may requirehuge amounts of storage space. We propose a summarized representation of XML data;based on the concept of instance pattern; which can both provide succinct information andbe directly queried. The physical representation of instance patterns exploits itemsets orassociation rules to summarize the content of XML datasets. Instance patterns may be usedfor (possibly partially) answering queries; either when fast and approximate answers arerequired; or when the actual dataset is not available; for example; it is currently unreachable.Experiments on large XML documents show that instance patterns allow a significantreduction in storage space; while preserving almost entirely the completeness of the queryresult. Furthermore; they provide fast query answers and show good scalability on the …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2007,44

Termination and confluence by rule prioritization,Sara Comai; Letizia Tanca,An active database system is a DBMS endowed with active rules; ie; stored proceduresactivated by the system when specific events occur. The processing of active rules ischaracterized by two important properties: termination and confluence. We say that theprocessing of a set of active rules terminates if; given any initial active database state; theexecution of the rules does not continue indefinitely; it is confluent if; for any initial databasestate; the final state is not influenced by the order of execution of the rules. Finding sufficientconditions for these properties to hold is a nontrivial problem; and the lack of a structuredtheory for the design of a system of active rules makes the analysis of the two propertiesmore difficult. In this work; we translate a set of rules from any of the existing systems into aninternal format; then; we translate the active rules into logical clauses; taking into account …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2003,40

After a summary of the basic features on the language; we focuson complex queries; whose expressive power subsumes some well-known relationaloperations (eg union; difference; cartesian product) but goes well beyond from theserelatively simple operators.,Proceedings of the 2000 ACM symposium on Applied computing-Volume 2,2000,39
Automatic rule generation for constraint enforcement in active databases,Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In conventional database systems; consistency is preserved either by forbiddingoperations that violate integrity constraints or by rolling back transactions that produceinconsistent database states. A third way to integrity maintenance is that of post processingfaulty transactions; by introducing system-generated compensating actions that lead to adatabase state which is consistent and as close as possible to that intended by the user.Active databases provide the appropriate technology to implement this paradigm. Weintroduce a framework in which constraints are expressed in a logical language andautomatically translated into a set of database rules. We stress automatic derivation not onlyof the triggering conditions of rules but also of the compensating actions; so that the user ispresented with the complete set of actions available to repair constraint violations.

Temporal aspects of semistructured data,Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,In many applications information about the history of data and their dynamic aspects are justas important as static information. The increasing amount of information accessible throughthe Web has presented new challenges to academic and industrial research on databases.In this context; data are either structured; when coming from relational or object-orienteddatabases; or partially or completely unstructured; when they consist of simple collections oftext or image files. In the context of semistructured data; models and query languages mustbe extended in order to consider dynamic aspects. We present a model based on labeledgraphs for representing changes in semistructured data and a SQL-like query language forquerying it.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2001. TIME 2001.

A schema-based approach to modeling and querying WWW data,Sara Comai; Ernesto Damiani; Roberto Posenato; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The steady growth of the amount of data published on the World Wide Web has ledto a number of attempts to provide effective Web querying; as a complement to conventionalnavigation techniques. In this paper; we propose to support WWW querying by specifyingboth logical and navigational aspects of a Web site through the unifying notion of schema.Schemata are a powerful tool for classifying and maintaining WWW data as well as forsemantics-aware search on the Web. Moreover; schema availability is the basis for aneffective flexible querying mechanism. Following the style of such languages as Good and G-Log; the WG-Log language described in the paper uniformly represents site schemata;instances and queries as graphs. Gracefully supporting schemata that are huge or subject tochange; WG-Log adequately represents data whose structure is less rigid than that of …,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,1998,38

Context modelling and context-aware querying,Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Many interpretations of the notion of context have emerged in various fields andcontext-aware systems are pervading everyday life; becoming an expanding research field.Context has often a significant impact on the way humans (or machines) act; and on howthey interpret things; furthermore; a change in context causes a transformation in theexperience that is going to be lived. Accordingly; while the computer science community hasinitially perceived the context simply as a matter of user time and location; in the last fewyears this notion has been considered not simply as a state; but as part of a process in whichusers are involved; thus; sophisticated and general context models and systems have beenproposed to support context-aware applications. In this paper we propose a foundationalframework for the life-cycle of context-aware system; in which the system design and …,*,2011,35

The notion of fuzzy graph closurewith threshold is then used to obtain a fuzzy extension of the XML fuzzy graphs' topologicalstructure. Weights associated to closure arcs are computed as a conjunction of theimportance values of the underlying arcs in the original graph; via a context-based choice ofconjunctions. Query results are subgraphs of the resulting fuzzy closure graph; presented asa ranked list according to their degree of matching to the user query.,Kybernetika,2000,34

Operational and abstract semantics of the query language G-Log,Agostino Cortesi; Agostino Dovier; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The amount and variety of data available electronically have dramatically increasedin the last decade; however; data and documents are stored in different ways and do notusually show their internal structure. In order to take full advantage of the topologicalstructure of digital documents; and particularly web sites; their hierarchical organizationshould be exploited by introducing a notion of query similar to the one used in databasesystems. A good approach; in that respect; is the one provided by graphical querylanguages; originally designed to model object bases and later proposed for semistructureddata; like G-Log. The aim of this paper is to provide suitable graph-based semantics to thislanguage; supporting both data structure variability and topological similarities betweenqueries and document structures.

In this work we describe an approach to extractTree-based association rules from XML documents. Such rules provide approximate;intensional information on both the structure and the content of XML documents; and can bestored in XML format to be queried later on.

Modeling semistructured data by using graph-based constraints,Ernesto Damiani; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The widespread adoption of semistructured and more in particular XML data hasopened a new venue for the application of formal methods to the speci. cation of models forde. ning classes of semistructured or XML documents [1; 3]. Most current models forsemistructured data are too speci. c to allow immediate comparison with each other; and donot easily support incremental model design. For this reason; we introduce the GeneralSemistructured Meta-Model (GSMM); a simple meta-model for semistructured informationwhich can be applied for the translation to a common formalism of the various abstractmodels proposed in literature; this approach fosters easy a priori comparison and discussionof concrete models' features; such as allowed sets of values; handling of object identi. ers;relationships representation; moreover; it supports e. ective inter-model translation and …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2003,20
Mining tree-based frequent patterns from XML,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The increasing amount of very large XML datasets available to casual users is achallenging problem for our community; and calls for an appropriate support to efficientlygather knowledge from these data. Data mining; already widely applied to extract frequentcorrelations of values from both structured and semi-structured datasets; is the appropriatefield for knowledge elicitation. In this work we describe an approach to extract Tree-basedassociation rules from XML documents. Such rules provide approximate; intensionalinformation on both the structure and the content of XML documents; and can be stored inXML format to be queried later on. A prototype system demonstrates the effectiveness of theapproach.,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,2009,19
Semantic data markets: a flexible environment for knowledge management,Roberto De Virgilio; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca; Riccardo Torlone,Abstract We present Nyaya; a system for the management of Semantic-Web data whichcouples a general-purpose and extensible storage mechanism with efficient ontologyreasoning and querying capabilities. Nyaya processes large Semantic-Web datasets;expressed in multiple formalisms; by transforming them into a collection of Semantic DataKiosks. Nyaya uniformly exposes the native meta-data of each kiosk using the datalog+-language; a powerful rule-based modelling language for ontological databases. The kiosksform a Semantic Data Market where the data in each kiosk can be uniformly accessed usingconjunctive queries and where users can specify user-defined constraints over the data.Nyaya is easily extensible and robust to updates of both data and meta-data in the kiosk andcan readily adapt to different logical organization of the persistent storage. The approach …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,18
The ESTEEM platform: enabling P2P semantic collaboration through emerging collective knowledge,Stefano Montanelli; Devis Bianchini; Carola Aiello; Roberto Baldoni; Cristiana Bolchini; Silvia Bonomi; Silvana Castano; Tiziana Catarci; Valeria De Antonellis; Alfio Ferrara; Michele Melchiori; Elisa Quintarelli; Monica Scannapieco; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this paper; we present Esteem (Emergent Semantics and cooperaTion in multi-knowledgE EnvironMents); a community-based P2P platform for supporting semanticcollaboration among a set of independent peers; without prior reciprocal knowledge and nopredefined relationships. Goal of Esteem is to go beyond the existing state-of-the-artsolutions for P2P knowledge sharing and to provide an integrated platform for both data andservice discovery. A distinguishing feature of Esteem is the use of semantic communities toexplicitly give shape to the collective knowledge and expertise of peer groups with similarinterests. Key techniques of Esteem will be presented in the paper and concern: shuffling-based communication; ontology and service matchmaking; context management; andquality-aware data integration.

Ontology-based information tailoring,Carlo Curino; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Current applications are often forced to filter the richness of datasources in order to reducethe information noise the user is subject to. We consider this aspect as a critical issue ofapplications; to be factorized at the data management level. The Context-ADDICT system;leveraging on ontology-based context and domain models; is able to personalize the data tobe made available to the user by" context-aware tailoring". In this paper we present a formalapproach to the definition of the relationship between context (represented by anappropriate context model) and application domain (modeled by a domain ontology). Oncesuch relationship has been defined; we are able to work out the boundary of the portion ofthe domain relevant to a user in a certain context. We also sketch the implementation of avisual tool supporting the application designer in this modeling task,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006. Proceedings. 22nd International Conference on,2006,18
A data-mining approach to preference-based data ranking founded on contextual information,Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The term information overload was already used back in the 1970s by Alvin Tofflerin his book Future Shock; and refers to the difficulty to understand and make decisions whentoo much information is available. In the era of Big Data; this problem becomes much moredramatic; since users may be literally overwhelmed by the cataract of data accessible in themost varied forms. With context-aware data tailoring; given a target application; in eachspecific context the system allows the user to access only the view which is relevant for thatapplication in that context. Moreover; the relative importance of information to the same userin a different context or; reciprocally; to a different user in the same context; may varyenormously; for this reason; contextual preferences can be used to further refine the viewsassociated with contexts; by imposing a ranking on the data of each context-aware view …,Information Systems,2013,17
Context-Based Data Tailoring for Mobile Users.,Letizia Tanca,Abstract: Independent; heterogeneous; distributed; sometimes transient and mobile datasources produce an enormous amount of information that should be semantically integratedand filtered; or; as we say; tailored; based on the users' interests and context. Since both theuser and the data sources may be mobile; and communication unreliable; caching theinformation on the user device is certainly useful. Thus; we propose to exploit knowledgeabout the user; the adopted device; and the environment-altogether called context-to theend of information tailoring. The key is context-aware data design where the notion ofcontext must be formally defined; together with its role within the process of informationtailoring. This paper presents a context model; called Context Dimension Tree; which playsa fundamental role in tailoring the information domain model within the framework of the …,BTW Workshops,2007,17
Semantic approaches to structuring and querying Web sites,Ernesto Damiani; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In order to pose effective queries to Web sites; some form of site data model mustbe implicitly or explicitly shared by users. Many approaches try to compensate for the lack ofsuch a common model by considering the hypertextual structure of Web sites; unfortunately;this structure has usually little to do with data semantics. In this paper a different technique isproposed that allows for both navigational and logical/conceptual description of Web sites.The data model is based on WG-log; a query language based on the graph-orienteddatabase model of GOOD (Gyssens et al. 1997) and G-log (Paredaens et al. 1995); whichallows the description of data manipulation primitives via (sets of) graph (s). The WG-logdescription of a Web site schema is lexically based on standard hypermedia designlanguages; thus allowing for easy schema generation by current hypermedia authoring …,*,1998,17
Towards autonomic pervasive systems: the PerLa context language,Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca; Romolo Camplani; Diego Viganó,ABSTRACT The property of context-awareness; inherent to a Pervasive System; requires aclear definition of context and of how the context parameter values must be extracted fromthe real world. Since often the same variables are common to the operational system and tothe context it operates into; the usage of the same language to manage both the applicationand the context can lead to substantial savings in application development time and costs. Inthis paper we propose a context-management extension to the PerLa language andmiddleware that allows for declarative gathering of context data from the environment;feeding this data to the internal context model and; once a context is active; acting on therelevant resources of the pervasive system; according to the chosen contextual policy.,Electronic Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Networking Meets Databases (Co-located with SIGMOD 2011); Athens,2011,16

Modeling users' navigation history,Ernesto Damiani; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A lot of recent research has focused on methods of modeling Web users and onefficient ways to initialize and manage user models. In this paper; we present a new usermodeling technique relying on a temporal; graph-based data model for semistructuredinformation. Our technique can be used to filter WWW information and to make the Webexperience personalized for the individual user. Moreover; such graph based data modelalso offers appropriate query languages; which allow user-defined queries either over thewhole web site or over the personalized user site views.,In Proc. of Intl’Workshop on Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalisation (in conj. with IJCAI-01,2001,16

Problems and opportunities in context-based personalization,Letizia Tanca; Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Giorgio Orsi,ABSTRACT In a world of global networking; the increasing amount of heterogeneousinformation; available through a variety of channels; has made it difficult for users to find theinformation they need in the current situation; at the right level of detail. This is true not onlywhen accessing information from mobile devices; characterized by limited–althoughgrowing–resources and by high connection costs; but also when using powerful systems;since the amount of “out-of-context” answers to a given user request may be overwhelming.The knowledge of the context in which the data are going to be used can support theprocess of focussing on currently useful; personalized information. The activity needed forcontextaware information personalization provides material for stimulating research; brieflyillustrated in this paper.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,15
CADD: a tool for context modeling and data tailoring,Cristiana Bolchini; CA Curino; Giorgio Orsi; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Nowadays user mobility requires that both content and services be appropriatelypersonalized; in order for the (mobile) user to be always-and anywhere-equipped with theadequate share of data. Thus; the knowledge about the user; the adopted device and theenvironment; altogether called context; has to be taken into account in order to minimize theamount of information imported on mobile devices. The Context-ADDICT (Context-AwareData Design; Integration; Customization and Tailoring) project aims at the definition of acomplete framework which; starting from a methodology for the early design phases;supports mobile users through the dynamic hooking and integration of new; availableinformation sources; so that an appropriate context-based portion of data; called data chunk;is delivered to their mobile devices.

The LOGIDATA+ language and semantics,Paolo Atzeni; Luca Cabibbo; Giansalvatore Mecca; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A language for the LOGIDATA+ model is presented. The language is rule-basedand allows for the management of complex structures; classes; hierarchies and datafunctions. Negation is allowed in the body of rules. The semantics is based on a fixpointoperator and represents an extension of ordinary declarative-language semantics. The mainissue is the management of oid-invention; that is; the creation and manipulation of objectsbelonging to the classes of a scheme. In order to correctly deal with negation andmultivalued data functions; an extended notion of stratification is introduced.,*,1993,15
Context awareness in pervasive information management,Francesco Colace; Vincenzo Moscato; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Context has been defined as the knowledge that can be used to characterize thesituation of any entity that is relevant for the (pervasive) system under consideration: given atarget application scenario; a context-aware system supports users and devices by providingselective access to the set of data and operations (eg; interesting services and information;environmental data; close-by people; points of interest etc.) which is relevant in each specificcontext. More than that; the relative importance of a piece of information to the same user indifferent contexts or; reciprocally; to different users in the same context may varyenormously; thus the system can personalize information even further by ranking theprovided data on the basis of (contextual) user preferences.

The APPROXML tool demonstration,Ernesto Damiani; Nico Lavarini; Stefania Marrara; Barbara Oliboni; Daniele Pasini; Letizia Tanca; Giuseppe Viviani,Abstract XML information items collected from heterogeneous sources often carry similarsemantics but turn out to be structured in different ways. Variations in structure makeeffective search of information across multiple datasources hard to achieve. Our approach isaimed at a flexible search and processing technique; capable to extract relevant informationfrom a possibly huge set of XML documents. ApproXML is a software tool supportingapproximate pattern-based querying; able to locate and extract XML information dealingflexibly with differences in structure and tag vocabulary. Our method relies on representingXML documents as graphs; through a variant of the DOM model. The relevant information isselected as follows [Dam00a]: first; a XML pattern; ie a partially specified subtree; is providedby the user. Then; the XML documents of the target dataset are scanned; XML fragments …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,14
Integration of functions in logic database systems,Erik Lambrichts; Peter Nees; Jan Paredaens; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,Abstract We extend Datalog; a logic programming language for rule-based systems; byrespectively integrating types; negation and functions. This extention of Datalog is calledMilAnt. Furthermore; MilAnt consistency is defined as a stronger form of consistency forfunctions. It is known that consistency for functions is undecidable. We prove that MilAntconsistency is decidable and an algorithm is given to detect the MilAnt consistency of aMilAnt program. To this end; we use a mixture of dependencies that are local to a rule anddependencies that are global for the whole program.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1990,14
Operational and Abstract Semantics of a Query Language for Semi-Structured Information.,Agostino Cortesi; Agostino Dovier; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The paper revisits the semantics of G-log; a graph-oriented query language for semi-structured data.

In this setting; somesubtle ambiguities in the semantics of G-log queries can be successfully addressed.,DDLP,1998,13
A uniform model to express the behaviour of rules with different semantics,Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali; Giuseppe Psaila; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Active databases couple database technology with rule-based programming andoffer a natural way to develop applications in which the shared properties of data arecentralised instead of being scattered among application programs. Unfortunately;designing; implementing and evolving applications based on the active database paradigmis still a very difficult task; mostly due to the poor understanding of the semantic issuesunderlying active rules. This paper provides a categorization of the dimensions of activedatabase semantics and provides a uniform model to describe rules with differentbehaviours; capable of expressing the features of most commercial system and researchprototypes.,*,1996,13
The LOGIDATA+ model and language,Paolo Atzeni; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The goal of the LOGIDATA+ project is the definition; design and prototypicalimplementation of data base systems that significantly extend the functionalities of thecurrent generation of data base systems; with specific reference to those applications forwhich relational systems are not considered satisfactory. LOGIDATA+ is a database modelconceived in order to respond to extended needs by allowing complex structures; byrepresenting semantic links (generalization hierarchies and relationships); and by providinga rule-based query and update language. The model involves three main constructs:classes; relations and functions. LOGIDATA+ databases can be accessed by means of arule-based language; a typed extension of logic programming languages with specificconstructs to refer to classes; functions; and relations.,*,1991,13
Database challenges for exploratory computing,Marcello Buoncristiano; Giansalvatore Mecca; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Donatello Santoro; Letizia Tanca,Helping users to make sense of very big datasets is nowadays considered an importantresearch topic. However; the tools that are available for data analysis purposes typicallyaddress professional data scientists; who; besides a deep knowledge of the domain ofinterest; master one or more of the following disciplines: mathematics; statistics; computerscience; computer engineering; and programming. On the contrary; in our vision it is vital tosupport also different kinds of users who; for various reasons; may want to analyze the dataand obtain new insight from them. Examples of these data enthusiasts [4; 9] are journalists;investors; or politicians: non-technical users who can draw great advantage from exploringthe data; achieving new and essential knowledge; instead of reading query results with tonsof records.

Exploratory computing: a challenge for visual interaction,Nicoletta Di Blas; Mirjana Mazuran; Paolo Paolini; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The advent of the Big Data challenge has stimulated research on methods to dealwith the problem of managing data abundance. Many approaches have been developed;but for the most part; they attack one specific side of the problem: eg efficient querying;analysis techniques that summarize data or reduce its dimensionality; data visualization; etc.The approach proposed in this poster aims instead at taking a comprehensive view: first ofall; it supports human exploration as an iterative and multi-step process and therefore allowsbuilding upon a previous query on to the next; in a sort of" dialogue" between the user andthe system. Second; it aims at supporting a variety of user experiences; like investigation;inspiration seeking; monitoring; comparison; decision-making; research; etc. Third; andprobably most important; it adds to the notion of" big" the notion of" rich": Exploratory …,Proceedings of the 2014 International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,2014,12
Pushing context-awareness down to the core: more flexibility for the PerLa language,Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca; Romolo Camplani; Diego Viganó,ABSTRACT Information technology is increasingly pervading our environment; making realMark Weiser's vision of a “disappearing technology”. The work described in this paperfocuses on using context to enable pervasive system personalization; allowing context-aware sensor-data tailoring. Since sensor networks; besides data collection; are also able toproduce active behaviours; the tailoring capabilities are also extended to these; thusapplying context-awareness to generic system operations. Moreover; because the numberof possible context can grow rapidly with the complexity of the application; the design phaseis also supported by the possibility to speed-up and modularize the definition of the data andoperations associated with each specific context; producing a support tool that eases the jobof the designers of modern context-aware pervasive systems.,Proc.

Using the properties of datalog to prove termination and confluence in active databases,Sara Comai; Letizia Tanca,Abstract An active database system is a DBMS endowed with active rules; ie storedprocedures activated by the system when specific events occur. The processing of activerules is characterized by two important properties: termination and confluence. We say thatthe processing of a set of active rules terminates if; given any initial active database state;the execution of the rules does not continue indefinitely; it is confluent if; for any activedatabase state; the final state does not depend on the order of execution of the rules.Finding sufficient conditions is a nontrivial problem and the lack of a structured theory for thedesign of a system of active rules makes the analysis of the two properties more difficult. Inthis work; we see ECA rules as an evolution of deductive rules: we translate the active rulesinto logical clauses; taking into account the system's execution semantics; then we try to …,International Workshop on Rules in Database Systems,1997,12

XML document summarization: Using XQuery for synopsis creation,Sara Comai; Stefania Marrara; Letizia Tanca,This work presents a methodology to support approximate queries over massive andheterogeneous XML data sets; based on concise data statistics such as histograms or otherstatistical techniques. The basic idea for approximate answers is to store precomputedsummaries of the XML data; also called synopses; and to query them instead of the originaldatabase; thus saving time and computational costs. In particular; We concentrate on a set ofXQuery transformation rules for the construction of the synopses collection and for queryingthe synopsis.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2004.

Using context for the extraction of relational views,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The paper presents an approach for automatically extracting views from a relationaldatabase schema; based on the knowledge of the application domain. In order to achievesuch result; the possible contexts emerging from the application domain are identified and;starting from the representation of the characterizing dimensions; a sequence of operationsis applied to the schema to derive the portion of interest or; as we say; to tailor the schemawith respect to each possible context. We introduce the tailoring operators as well as themethod to compose partial views to obtain the final ones; a running example is used to leadthe reader through the steps of the proposed methodology.,International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and Using Context,2007,10
Semi-automatic support for evolving functional dependencies.,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca; Stefania Ugolini,ABSTRACT During the life of a database; systematic and frequent violations of a givenconstraint may suggest that the represented reality is changing and thus the constraintshould evolve with it. In this paper we propose a method and a tool to (i) find the functionaldependencies that are violated by the current data; and (ii) support their evolution when it isnecessary to update them. The method relies on the use of confidence; as a measure that isassociated with each dependency and allows us to understand” how far” the dependency isfrom correctly describing the current data; and of goodness; as a measure of balancebetween the data satisfying the antecedent of the dependency and those satisfying itsconsequent. Our method compares favorably with literature that approaches the sameproblem in a different way; and performs effectively and efficiently as shown by our tests …,EDBT,2016,9
Towards user centric schema mapping platform,Guilian Wang; Rami Rifaieh; Joseph Goguen; Vitaliy Zavesov; Arcot Rajasekar; Mark Miller,Abstract Schema mapping is a fundamental problem in many important databaseapplications. The process of mapping discovery is complex and error prone; it cannot befully automated; so user input is necessary. This paper presents SCIA; a system that assistsusers in creating executable mappings between a source schema and a target schema byautomating simple matches and finding critical points where user input is both necessaryand maximally useful. SCIA finds critical points by using path contexts together with acombination of multiple matching algorithms.

Thesedata may be from traditional databases; sensor readings; environmental information; close-by people; points of interest; etc. To implement context-awareness; we use a formalrepresentation of a conceptual context model; used to design the context schema; whichintensionally represents all the contexts in which the user may be involved in the consideredapplication scenario.

The semantic web languages,Fausto Giunchiglia; Feroz Farazi; Letizia Tanca; Roberto De Virgilio,Abstract The Semantic Web is basically an extension of the Web and of the Web-enablingdatabase and Internet technology; and; as a consequence; the Semantic Webmethodologies; representation mechanisms and logics strongly rely on those developed indatabases. This is the motivation for many attempts to; more or less loosely; merge the twoworlds like; for instance; the various proposals to use relational technology for storing webdata or the use of ontologies for data integration. This chapter comes after one on datamanagement; in order to first complete the picture with the description of the languages thatcan be used to represent information on the Semantic Web; and then highlight a fewfundamental differences which make the database and Semantic Web paradigmscomplementary; but somehow difficult to integrate.,*,2010,8

Designing and prototyping data-intensive applications in the Logres and Algres programming environment,Filippo Cacace; Stefano Ceri; Letizia Tanca; Stefano Crespi-Reghizzi,The authors present an environment and a methodology for the design and rapidprototyping of data-intensive software applications; ie; applications which performsubstantial retrieval and update activity on persistent data. In the approach; the application isformally specified using Logres; a database language which combines object-oriented datamodeling and rule-based programming. These specifications are translated into Algres; anextended relational algebra; thus yielding a rapid executable prototype. Algres programsembedded into a conventional programming language interface may be converted toconventional programs operating on a commercial relational system. This methodologyhelps automate the conversion from declarative requirements to imperative code; performingseveral tasks fully automatically and reducing the probability of human errors; while …,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1992,8

Patch: A portable context-aware atlas for browsing cultural heritage,Francesco Colace; Massimo De Santo; Vincenzo Moscato; Antonio Picariello; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this final chapter; we show an application of discussed data managementpervasive technologies for a cultural heritage smart scenario by describing the PATCH(Portable context-aware ATlas for Cultural Heritage) system—a “portable” prototype of amultimedia and social “atlas” of cultural points of interest; in which browsing is driven by thecontext. The system is characterized by several features typical of pervasive systems:(1)capability of gathering information from distributed and heterogeneous pervasive datasources (eg; sensor networks; social networks; digital libraries and archives; multimediacollections; web data services; etc.);(2) context awareness and; consequently; ability ofproviding useful and personalized data and services for users on the basis of theirpreferences and of the surrounded environment;(3) advanced data management …,*,2015,7
Exploratory computing: a draft Manifesto,Nicoletta Di Blas; Mirjana Mazuran; Paolo Paolini; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,The advent of the Big Data challenge has stimulated research on methods and techniquesto deal with the problem of managing data abundance. Many approaches have beendeveloped; but for the most part; they attack one specific side of the problem: eg efficientquerying; analysis techniques that summarize data or reduce its dimensionality; datavisualization; etc. The approach proposed in this paper aims instead at taking acomprehensive view: first of all; it takes into account that human exploration is an iterativeand multi-step process and therefore allows building upon a previous query on to the next;in a sort of “dialogue” between the user and the system. Second; it aims at supporting avariety of user experiences; like investigation; inspiration seeking; monitoring; comparison;decision-making; research; etc. Third; and probably most important; it adds to the notion …,Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA); 2014 International Conference on,2014,7
ADaPT: automatic data personalization based on contextual preferences,Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,This demo presents a framework for personalizing data access on the basis of the users'context and of the preferences they show while in that context. The system is composed of (i)a server application; which “tailors” a view over the available data on the basis of the user'scontextual preferences; previously inferred from log data; and (ii) a client application runningon the user's mobile device; which allows to query the data view and collects the activity logfor later mining. At each change of context detected by the system the corresponding tailoredview is loaded on the client device: accordingly; the most relevant data is available to theuser even when the connection is unstable or lacking. The demo features a movie database;where users can browse data in different contexts and appreciate the personalization of thedata views according to the inferred contextual preferences.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,7
Aspects of pervasive information management: an account of the green move system,Emanuele Panigati; Angelo Rauseo; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,The Green Move project aims at realizing a zero-emission-vehicle (ZEV) sharing service thatalso includes pervasive information distribution. In this paper we discuss the use of context-aware techniques applied to data gathering; shared services; and information distribution;we also discuss how a context-aware approach applied to these tasks leads to the reductionof (noisy) information delivered to the users and to the personalized distribution ofinformation. Privacy of data is also a main concern in the realization of the project; and aprivacy-safe approach to information distribution and advertising is adopted. The project;grounded in many results on the use of context-awareness already published by the sameauthors; aims at building a real-life system based on them.

Merging graph-based and rule-based computation: The language G-Log,Jan Paredaens; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this paper we discuss the merging of two different computation paradigms: thefixpoint computation for deductive databases and the pattern-matching computation forgraph-based languages. We show how these paradigms can be combined on the exampleof the declarative; graph-based; database query language G-Log. A naive algorithm tocompute G-Log programs turns out to be very inefficient. However; we also present abacktracking fixpoint algorithm for Generative G-Log; a syntactical sublanguage of G-Logthat; like G-Log; is non-deterministic complete. This algorithm is considerably more efficient;and reduces to the standard fixpoint computation for a sublanguage of Generative G-Logthat is a graphical equivalent of Datalog. The paper also studies some interesting propertieslike satisfiability and triviality; that are undecidable for full G-Log and turn out to be …,Data & knowledge engineering,1998,7
Recommending new items to ephemeral groups using contextual user influence,Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Group recommender systems help groups of users in finding appropriate items tobe enjoyed together. Lots of activities; like watching TV or going to the restaurant; areintrinsically group-based; thus making the group recommendation problem very relevant. Inthis paper we study ephemeral groups; ie; groups where the members might be together forthe first time. Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to belearned offline; making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary; we propose agroup recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail; our techniquedetermines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences ofthe group members on the basis of their contextual influence; where the contextual influencerepresents the ability of an individual; in a given situation; to direct the group's decision …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,2016,6
Data Management in Pervasive Systems,Francesco Colace; Massimo De Santo; Vincenzo Moscato; Antonio Picariello; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,The adjective pervasive comes from the Latin verb pervadere; which literally means to gothrough. However; looking at modern dictionaries; we find wider definitions such as topermeate [5] or to diffuse in order to modify and characterize the atmosphere or thephysiognomy of a certain ambient [3]. The last definition well characterizes modernpervasive information systems; which had a remarkable growth in recent years. Indeed; asshown in Fig. 1; we can find applications of pervasive systems in the most disparatedomains; such as health care; archaeology; museums; pollution control; and others:domains which only a few years ago used computers only for administrative purposes andwere alien to involve computers directly in their functionality.

Reasoning over Large Semantic Datasets.,Roberto De Virgilio; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca; Riccardo Torlone,ABSTRACT This paper presents NYAYA; a flexible system for the management of Semantic-Web data which couples an efficient storage mechanism with advanced and up-to-dateontology reasoning capabilities. NYAYA is capable of processing large Semantic-Webdatasets; expressed in a variety of formalisms; by transforming them into a collection ofSemantic Data Kiosks that expose the native meta-data in a uniform fashion using Datalog±;a very general rule-based language. The kiosks form a Semantic Data Market where thedata in each kiosk can be uniformly accessed using conjunctive queries and where userscan specify user-defined constraints over the data. NYAYA is easily extensible and robust toupdates of both data and meta-data in the kiosk. In particular; a new kiosk of the semanticdata market can be easily built from a fresh Semantic-Web source expressed in …,SEBD,2009,6
Information systems integration and evolution: Ontologies at rescue,Carlo A Curino; Letizia Tanca; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The life of a modern Information System is often characterized by (i) a push towardintegration with other systems; and (ii) the evolution of its data management core inresponse to continuously changing application requirements. Most of the current proposalsdealing with these issues from a database perspective rely on the formal notions of mappingand query rewriting. This paper presents the research agenda of ADAM (Advanced DataAnd Metadata Manager); by harvesting the recent theoretical advances in this area into aunified framework; ADAM seeks to deliver practical solutions to the problems of automaticschema mapping and assisted schema evolution. The evolution of an Information System(IS) reflects the changes occurring in the application reality that the IS is modelling: thus;ADAM exploits ontologies to capture such changes and provide traceability and …,International Workshop on Semantic Technologies in System Maintenance (STSM),2008,6
An approximate querying environment for xml data,Ernesto Damiani; Nico Lavarini; Barbara Oliboni; Letizia Tanca,Summary Often; XML information from heterogeneous sources carries the same semanticsbut turns out to be structured in different ways. In this Chapter we extend our previous workabout blind pattern-based XML querying by presenting an approximate querying techniquecapable to locate and extract information dealing flexibly with differences in structure and tagvocabulary. Our approach relies on representing XML documents as graphs; whose edgesare weighted at different levels of granularity. We describe a content-insensitive automaticweighting technique taking into account various characteristics of each edge; generating aseparate weight according to each characteristic; and then aggregating these values in asingle arc-weight. Then; a threshold-based pruning of unimportant edges is performed;allowing us to retain only the most useful information; improving search performance …,*,2004,6
Designing and developing context-aware mobile mashups: the CAMUS approach,Fabio Corvetta; Maristella Matera; Riccardo Medana; Elisa Quintarelli; Vincenzo Rizzo; Letizia Tanca,Abstract CAMUS (Context-Aware Mobile mashUpS) is a framework for the design of mobileapplications that dynamically collect and integrate heterogeneous resources (data sourcesand services) to offer integrated content and functions to mobile users in a context-awarefashion. CAMUS exploits a set of high-level abstractions for context and mashup modelingthat hide the complexity resulting from service selection; invocation and integration.Generative techniques then enable the transformation of models into running code formobile applications that flexibly respond to actual user needs as they vary in differentsituations of use.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2015,5

The Web has become moremature and full of potentialities as a platform for the development of interactive richapplications. The use of client-side scripting languages; the diffusion of Web Services andpublic APIs; and the always increasing basic skills of laypeople in the development of Webapplications shaped up a scenario in which a new class of web applications; the mashups;was born. Mashups integrate; at different levels of the application stack; data; functionalityand user interfaces from different resources such as Web Services; public APIs or enterprisedatabases. Mashups emerged in response to the need of users; not necessarily experts oftechnology; to quickly assemble Web resources to create new Web applications solving …,*,2014,5
Semantic pervasive advertising,Lorenzo Carrara; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Pervasive advertising targets consumers on-the-move with ads displayed on theirmobile devices. As for web advertising; ads are distributed by embedding them into websitesand apps; easily flooding consumers with a large number of uninteresting offers. As thepervasive setting amplifies traditional issues such as targeting; cost; and privacy; we arguethe need for a new perspective on the problem. We introduce PervADs; a privacy-preserving; user-centric; and pervasive ads-distribution platform which uses semantictechnologies to reason about the consumer's context and the intended target of the ads.,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2013,5

Its researchand development methodologies build on the scientific and design methodologies in theclassical areas; often with new elements to it. We take an in-depth look at one of the lesswell-understood methodologies in informatics; namely experimentation. What does it meanto do experiments in informatics? Does it make sense to 'import'traditional principles ofexperimentation from classical disciplines into the field of computing and informationprocessing? How should experiments be documented? These are some of the questionsthat are treated.,8th European Computer Science Summit of Informatics Europe,2013,5

Using wg-log schemata to represent semistructured data,Ernesto Damiani; Barbara Oliboni; Letizia Tanca; D Veronese,Abstract In this paper we discuss the possibility to represent synthetically semistructuredinformation via a loose notion of schema: we say that data are semistructured when;although some structure is present; it is not as strict; regular; or complete as the one requiredby the traditional database management systems. Our proposal is based on WG-Log; agraph based language for the representation of WWW site information. We show howinformation encoded in a typical semistructured information model; as OEM; can berepresented and queried by means of the WG-Log language; and how the TSIMMIS and WG-Log Web Query System can be integrated to allow site content exploration and exploitationby means of WG-Log.,*,1999,5

Integration of functions in the fixpoint semantics of rule-based systems,Erik Lambrichts; Peter Nees; Jan Paredanes; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,Abstract We discuss the integration of functions; types; complex objects and negation in arule-based system; using the fixpoint semantics. This extension of Datalog is called MilAnt.The rules; the predicates and the functions are typed with complex objects. Functions can bedefined to have a result of an arbitrary complex object type. MilAnt consistency is defined asa stronger form of consistency for functions and an algorithm is given to detect the MilAntconsistency in the non-recursive case. To this end; we use a mixture of dependencies thatare local to a rule and dependencies that are global for the whole program.,Symposium on Mathematical Fundamentals of Database Systems,1989,5
Personalized and context-aware TV program recommendations based on implicit feedback,Paolo Cremonesi; Primo Modica; Roberto Pagano; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The current explosion of the number of available channels is making the choice ofthe program to watch an experience more and more difficult for TV viewers. Such a hugeamount obliges the users to spend a lot of time in consulting TV guides and readingsynopsis; with a heavy risk of even missing what really would have interested them. In thispaper we confront this problem by developing a recommender system for TV programs.Recommender systems have been widely studied in the video-on-demand field; but the TVdomain poses its own challenges which make the traditional video-on-demand techniquesnot suitable. In more detail; we propose recommendation algorithms relying exclusively onimplicit feedback and leveraging context information.

Introduction to the TPLP special issue; logic programming in databases: From Datalog to semantic-web rules,Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Much has happened in data and knowledge base research since the introduction ofthe relational model in Codd (1970) and its strong logical foundations influence its advancesever since. Logic has been a common ground where Database and Artificial Intelligenceresearch competed and collaborated with each other for a long time (Abiteboul et al. 1995).The product of this joint effort has been a set of logic-based formalisms; such as theRelational Calculus (Codd 1970); Datalog (Ceri et al. 1990); Description Logics (Baader etal. 2007); etc.; capturing not only the structure but also the semantics of data in an explicitway; thus enabling complex inference procedures.,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2010,4

Consistency constraints on the database schema re ectthe policies and procedures adopted in the business process: they are de ned and enforcedto guarantee system correctness.

On the CALM principle for BSP computation,Matteo Interlandi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract. In recent times; considerable emphasis has been given to two apparently disjointresearch topics: data-parallel and eventually consistent; distributed systems. In this paperwe propose a study on an eventually consistent; dataparallel computational model; thekeystone of which is provided by the recent finding that a class of programs exists that canbe computed in an eventually consistent; coordination-free way: monotonic programs. Thisprinciple is called CALM and has been proven by Ameloot et al. for distributed;asynchronous settings. We advocate that CALM should be employed as a basic theoreticaltool also for data-parallel systems; wherein computation usually proceeds synchronously inrounds and where communication is assumed to be reliable.

Navigation Strategies for Exploration and Patrolling with Autonomous Mobile Robots,Nicola Basilico; Francesco Amigoni; Letizia Tanca; Barbara Pernici,Abstract Recent advances in mobile robotics showed that the employment of autonomousmobile robots can be an effective technique to deal with tasks that are difficult or dangerousfor humans. Examples include exploration; coverage; search and rescue; and surveillance.Fundamental issues involved in the development of autonomous robots span locomotion;sensing; localization; and navigation. One of the most challenging problems is the definitionof navigation strategies. A navigation strategy can be generally defined as the set oftechniques that allow a robot to autonomously decide where to move in the environment inorder to accomplish a given task. As a typical example; consider a robot exploring andmapping an unknown environment that has to select the next location; within the currentlyexplored portion of space; where to take a sensing action.

Mining violations to relax relational database constraints,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Frequent constraint violations on the data stored in a database may suggest that therepresented reality is changing; and thus the database does not reflect it anymore. It is thusdesirable to devise methods and tools to support (semi-) automatic schema changes; inorder for the schema to mirror the new situation. In this work we propose a methodology andthe RELACS tool; based on data mining; to maintain the domain and tuple integrityconstraints specified at design time; in order to adjust them to the evolutions of the modeledreality that may occur during the database life.

Graph transformation for merging user navigation histories,Mario Michele Gala; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Web Mining is a promising research area which mainly studies how to personalizethe Web experience for users. In order to achieve this goal it is fundamental to analyze theuser navigations to get relevant informations about their behavior. In this work we consider adatabase approach based on a graphical representation of both Web sites and userinteractions. In particular; we will see how to obtain the graph summarizing a set of userinteractions from the graphs of single interactions by adopting the graph transformationtechnique.,International Workshop on Applications of Graph Transformations with Industrial Relevance,2003,3

Merging graph based and rule based computation,Jan Paredaens; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this paper we propose the merging of two different computation paradigms: thefixpoint computation for deductive databases and the pattern matching computation forgraph based languages. These paradigms are nicely combined in the declarative; graphbased; database query language G-Log. A natural algorithm to compute general G-Logprograms turns out to be very inefficient. We therefore present a more efficient backtrackingfixpoint algorithm for Generative G-Log; a syntactical sublanguage of G-Log that; like G-Log;is non-deterministic complete. This algorithm reduces to the standard fixpoint computationfor a sublanguage of Generative G-Log that is the graphical equivalent of Datalog. Thepaper further studies some interesting properties like satisfiability and triviality; that ingeneral are undecidable for full G-Log and turn out to be decidable for sufficiently general …,*,1994,3
Supporting interoperability between new database languages,S Ceri; L Tanca; R Zicari,A general framework is described for achieving interoperability between two databaselanguages; Logres and SOL (Stretch object-oriented language); respectively based on arule-based and an object-oriented paradigm. A discussion is presented of primitives forexporting and importing data and procedures; distinguishing the export modalitiesby'copy'and by'reference'.

Object orientation and logic programming for databases: a season's flirt or long-term marriage?,Stefano Ceri; Filippo Cacace; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A recent direction of database research has been focused on integrating logicprogramming and object orientation. The rationale of such integration stems from twoarguments; on one hand; object-orientation brings powerful data modeling capabilities byadding semantic and structural complexity to value-based relational databases. On the otherhand; logic programming languages provide means for expressing queries and updates ona database with a declarative style; further; they provide the ideal language paradigms forexpressing constraints and integrity rules.

Reducing big data by means of context-aware tailoring,Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Context-aware personalization is one of the possible ways to face the problem ofinformation overload; that is; the difficulty of understanding an issue and making decisionswhen receiving too much information. Context-aware personalization can reduce theinformation noise; by proposing to the users only the information which is relevant to theircurrent contexts. In this work we propose an approach that uses data mining algorithms toautomatically infer the subset of data that; for each context; must be presented to the user;thus reducing the information noise.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2016,2

Being able to understand the financial market is very important for investors and;given the width and complexity of the topic; tools to support investor decisions are badlyneeded. In this paper we present Mercurio; a system that supports the decision-makingprocess of financial investors through the automatic extraction and analysis of financial datacoming from the Web. Mercurio formalizes the knowledge and reasoning of an expert infinancial journalism and uses it to identify relevant events within financial newspapers.Moreover; it performs automatic analysis of financial indexes to identify relevant eventsrelated to the stock market. Then; sequential pattern mining is used to predict exceptionalevents on the basis of the knowledge of their past occurrences and relationships with otherevents; in order to to warn investors about them.,FINREC,2016,2
Exploratory Computing: What is there for the Database Researcher?,Marcello Buoncristiano; Giansalvatore Mecca; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Donatello Santoro; Letizia Tanca,Abstract. The need for effective tools helping users to make sense of very big datasets hasreceived a lot of attention lately. In this paper we propose a paradigm for databaseexploration which is in turn inspired by the exploratory computing vision [2]. We maydescribe exploratory computing as the step-by-step “conversation” of a user and a systemthat “help each other” to refine the data exploration process; ultimately gathering newknowledge that concretely fulfills the user needs. In this broad and innovative context; thispaper proposes a model to concretely perform this kind of exploration over a database. Themodel is general enough to encompass most data models and query languages that havebeen proposed for data management in the last few years. At the same time; it is preciseenough to provide a first formalization of the problem and reason about the research …,SEBD,2015,2

Using WG-Log to Represent Semistructured Data: The Example of OEM.,Barbara Oliboni; Letizia Tanca; D Veronese,Abstract. In this paper we discuss the possibility to represent synthetically semistructuredinformation via a loose notion of schema: we say that data are semistructured when;although some structure is present; it is not as strict; regular; or complete as the one requiredby the traditional database management systems. Our proposal is based on WG-Log; agraph based language for the representation of WWW site information. We show howinformation encoded in a typical semistructured information model; as OEM; can berepresented and queried by means of the WG-Log language; and how the TSIMMIS and WG-Log Web Query System can be integrated to allow site content exploration and exploitationby means of WG-Log.,SEBD,1998,2

Towards a statistical framework for attribute comparison in very large relational databases,Cesare Alippi; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Letizia Tanca,The technological evolution and the multiplication of information sources has brought aboutan ever-increasing need of techniques for the analysis of largescale databases. The recentresearch; generally collected under the umbrella of “Big Data Analytics”; attempts to solvethis many-sided problem. We briefly describe a general methodology for the statisticalanalysis of large-scale databases with the aim to extract relevant; often implicit orunexpected; information about the distribution of the attribute values in two (large) tuple setsresulting from different queries on a large database. This analysis has the main aim ofhelping users to gain knowledge about the datasets they are exploring (see Blas et al.;2014).

In this paper we proposea theoretical study over an eventually consistent data-parallel computational model. Thekeystone is provided by the recent finding that a class of programs exists which can becomputed in an eventually consistent; coordination-free way: monotonic programs.

A synopsis based approach for XML fast approximate querying,Sara Comai; Stefania Marrara; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In the last few years; XML has spread in many application fields and today it is usedas a format to exchange data on the web; to ensure inter-operability among applications.Due to this success; the W3C has proposed a new query language; XQuery [25]; specificallydesigned to query XML data. XQuery is a well-defined but rather complex language [14]. Inthis work we propose a new approach to overcome the problem of the high computationalcosts required by aggregate queries over massive XML data collections. In traditionalrelational warehouses [11] a similar problem is solved by means of fast approximatequeries; that use concise data statistics based on histograms or on other statisticaltechniques. Their most common application is for aggregate queries in modern decisionsupport systems; where large volumes of data need to be queried; and quick and …,*,2006,1

Checking functional consistency in deductive databases,Erik Lambrichts; Peter Nees; Jan Paredaens; Peter Peelman; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of integrating functions in Datalog. We extendDatalog to a language L containing negation; functions; and a strong type system. This typesystem is used by an algorithm that; given a program; checks for its L-consistency (astronger form of consistency) by using the notions of local dependencies and globaldependencies.,Information Processing Letters,1990,1

A Short Account of Techniques for Assisting Users in Mastering Big Data,Davide Martinenghi; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract One of the most challenging problems faced by the database community is to assistinexperienced or casual users; who need the support of a sophisticated system that guidesthem in making sense of the data. This problem becomes especially relevant in the case ofBig Data; where the amount of data may quickly overwhelm users and discourage them fromleveraging the richness of the data patrimony. In the last years; often in collaboration withother members of the Italian database community; we have developed several differenttechniques whose aim is both to reduce the size of the problem and to focus on theinformation that is most relevant to the user. To this end; most of these techniques fruitfullyextract and exploit data semantics; for example by succinctly characterizing data viaintensional properties such as integrity constraints or by tailoring the answer to the user …,*,2018,*
INDIANA the Database Explorer,Antonio Giuzio; Giansalvatore Mecca; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Donatello Santoro; Letizia Tanca,Abstract We propose INDIANA; a system conceived to support a novel paradigm of databaseexploration. INDIANA guides users that are interested in gaining insights about a databaseby involving them in a “conversation”. During the conversation; the system proposes somefeatures of the data that are “interesting” from the statistical viewpoint. The user selects someof these as starting points; and INDIANA reacts by suggesting new features related to theones selected by the user. A key requirement in this context is the ability to exploretransactional databases; without the need to conduct complex pre-processing. To this end;we develop a number of novel algorithms to support interactive exploration of the database.We report an in-depth experimental evaluation to show that the proposed systemguarantees a very good trade-off between accuracy and scalability; and a user study that …,*,2017,*

This paper presents a design methodology and an accompanying platform for thedesign and fast development of Context-Aware Mobile mashUpS (CAMUS). The approach ischaracterized by the role given to context as a first-class modeling dimension used tosupport (i) the identification of the most adequate resources that can satisfy the users'situational needs and (ii) the consequent tailoring at runtime of the provided data andfunctions. Context-based abstractions are exploited to generate models specifying how datareturned by the selected services have to be merged and visualized by means of integratedviews.

Then; the process can be modeled by using an approximatefunctional dependency between the data required by both events.

The MCMC algorithm Sub-Cluster HDP Sampler for the Hierarchical DirichletProcess mixture model; a Bayesian nonparametric model; is suitable to this purpose. Thecode is written in C++ language and is parallelized with the OpenMP library. In order to keepthe same flexibility of the model in the implementation; template programming andinheritance techniques are employed. In this way; it is easy to extend the code for a differentapplication. A specialized class for topic modeling is developed; so as to analyse aposteriori the algorithm's results.

Personalized and Context-Aware TV Program Recommendations Based on Implicit Feedback,Letizia Tanca,Abstract. The current explosion of the number of available channels is making the choice ofthe program to watch an experience more and more difficult for TV viewers.

In thispaper we confront this problem by developing a recommender system for TV programs.Recommender systems have been widely studied in the video-on-demand field; but the TVdomain poses its own challenges which make the traditional video-on-demand techniquesnot suitable. In more detail; we propose recommendation algorithms relying exclusively onimplicit feedback and leveraging context information.

Semantic Approaches to Structuring and Querying Web,L Tanca,Abstract In order to pose effective queries to Web sites; some form of site data model mustbe implicitly or explicitly shared by users. Many approaches try to com-pensate for the lack ofsuch a common model by considering the hypertextual structure of Web sites; unfortunately;this structure has usually little to do with data semantics. In this paper a different technique isproposed that al-lows for both navigational and logical/conceptual description of Web sites.The data model is based on WG-log; a query language based on the graphorienteddatabase model of GOOD (Gyssens et al. 1997) and G-log (Paredaens et al. 1995); whichallows the description of data manipulation primitives via (sets of) graph (s).

Often; XML information from heterogeneous sources carries the same semanticsbut turns out to be structured in different ways. In this Chapter we extend our previous workabout blind pattern-based XML querying by presenting an approximate querying techniquecapable to locate and extract information dealing flexibly with differences in structure and tagvocabulary. Our approach relies on representing XML documents as graphs; whose edgesare weighted at different levels of granularity. We describe a content-insensitive automaticweighting technique taking into account various characteristics of each edge; generating aseparate weight according to each characteristic; and then aggregating these values in asingle arc-weight. Then; a threshold-based pruning of unimportant edges is performed;allowing us to retain only the most useful information; improving search performance …,Fuzzy Logic and the Internet,2012,*

A Framework for Mining and Querying Summarized XML Data through Tree-Based Association Rules,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Angelo Rauseo; Letizia Tanca,ABSTRACT The massive amount of datasets expressed in different formats; such asrelational; XML; and RDF; available in several real applications; may cause some difficultiesto non-expert users trying to access these datasets without having sufficient knowledge ontheir content and structure. Moreover; the processes of query composition; especially in theabsence of a schema; and interpretation of the obtained answers may be non-trivial. Datamining techniques; already widely applied to extract frequent correlations of values fromboth structured and semistructured datasets; provide several interesting solutions forknowledge elicitation. However; the mining process is often guided by the designer; whodetermines the portion of a dataset where useful patterns can be extracted based on his/herdeep knowledge of the application scenario.

In a more restricted sense; the termQuadtree (Octree) refers to a tree data-structure in which each internal node has four (eight)children and is used for the representation of geometric entities in a two (three) dimensionalspace. The root of the tree represents the whole space/region. Each child of a noderepresents a subregion of the subregion of its parent.

Using mined patterns for XML Query Answering,Elena Baralis; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract XML is a rather verbose representation of semistructured data; which may requirehuge amounts of storage space. Several summarized representations of XML data havebeen proposed; which can both provide succinct information and be directly queried. In thischapter we focus on compact representations based on the extraction of association rulesfrom XML datasets. In particular; we show how patterns can be exploited to (possiblypartially) answer queries; either when fast (and approximate) answers are required; or whenthe actual dataset is not available; eg; it is currently unreachable. We focus on (a) schemapatterns; representing exact or approximate dataset constraints;(b) instance patterns; whichrepresent actual data summaries; and their use for answering queries.,*,2008,*

Logical and Physical Data Structures for Very Small Databases,Cristiana Bolchini; Fabio Salice; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract. The widespread adoption of portable devices and of embedded processors forprofessional embedded systems; and the technology underlying such devices raise newchallenges. We propose physical and logical data structures to provide efficient; energysaving and endurance preserving access to data; managed by means of a DBMS. Thepaper relates on a project studying innovative data structures at the logical and physicallevel; to be adopted in very small databases hosted by portable devices/embedded systems;characterized by Flash EEPROM storage. The task is in fact part of a complete methodologyfor designing very small databases.,*,2002,*

Using WG-Log to interact with heterogeneous data sources: the example of OEM,E Damiani; B Oliboni; L Tanca; D Veronese,Abstract In this paper we discuss the possibility to represent synthetically semistructuredinformation via a loose notion of schema: we say that data are semistructured when;although some structure is present; it is not as strict; regular; or complete as the one requiredby the traditional database management systems. Our proposal is based on WG-Log; agraph based language for the representation of WWW site information. We show howinformation encoded in a typical semistructured information model; as OEM; can berepresented and queried by means of the WG-Log language; and how the TSIMMIS and WG-Log Web Query System can be integrated to allow site content exploration and exploitationby means of WG-Log.,*,1998,*

Set-Oriented retrieval of complex objects in inheritance hierarchies,Filippo Cacace; P Samarati; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Many object oriented data models have been proposed in the past few years; andthis field is one of the most promising for the development of new generation databasesystems. With complex data structures where an ISA hierarchy has been defined; theproblem of efficiently storing and retrieving (a collection of) objects increases its relevancedramatically. This paper proposes efficient set-oriented algorithms for the storage andretrieval of complex objects in an inheritance hierarchy.,Computing,1995,*

Coupling Prolog Systems to Relational Databases,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In Chap. 3 we have seen that Prolog is a very expressive query language; one thatcan express queries with no counterpart in relational languages such as algebra or calculus.In this chapter; we describe how it is possible to build systems that interface Prolog todatabases; providing efficient data access.,*,1990,*
Prolog as a Query Language,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In Chap. 1 we provided an overview of the main reasons for the integration ofdatabase and logic programming technologies; and we established a comparison betweenthe main features of relational databases and logic programming languages. Here we willjust recall some important aspects of Prolog as a query language; these features essentiallyenrich the expressive power of classical query languages based on relational algebra orcalculus.,*,1990,*
Evaluation Methods,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this chapter; we present methods for evaluating a Datalog program; namely; forgenerating the actual set of tuples which satisfy a given user's goal for a given set of Datalogrules. We deal with bottom-up and top-down evaluation methods in two separate sections.Evaluation methods are expressed using either of the logic and algebraic formalismsintroduced in the previous chapter; and in fact we do not stress the choice of formalism verymuch; given the equivalence between them.,*,1990,*
A Review of Relational Databases and Prolog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,This chapter provides an overview of the prerequisite notions that are required in order to understandthis book. The reader who has a background in these topics can skip this chapter or part of it;perhaps after taking a look at the notation. The first section gives a description of the fundamentalconcepts of relational databases and relational algebra. The second section provides a briefintroduction to the language Prolog. We assume the reader to be familiar with the basic conceptsof first-order logic. Other aspects of logic programming will be treated in Chaps. 6 and 7; wherewe present a complete introduction to the language Datalog … The Relational Model was introducedby Codd in 1970 and represents; together with the Network and the Hierarchical models; oneof the three data models currently supported by most Database Management Systems(DBMS).

Classification of Optimization Methods for Datalog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this chapter; we provide a classification of optimization methods for evaluatingDatalog goals. We use orthogonal classification criteria in order to identify various classes ofmethods; then; each class will be dealt with in a separate section. A systematic overview ofmethods is required; since optimization can be achieved using a variety of techniques; andunderstanding their relationships is not obvious.,*,1990,*
Proof Theory and Evaluation Paradigms of Datalog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The aim of this chapter is to show how the answer to a Datalog program can becomputed. In order to achieve a computational approach to Datalog; in Sect. 7.1 we developthe proof theory of this language. We show how new facts can be inferred from anextensional database by use of a Datalog program. We then demonstrate that our proof-theoretic method is sound and complete; ie; that it computes exactly what it should accordingto the model-theoretic semantics of Datalog. The proof theory of Datalog leads to a firstalgorithm “INFER” for processing Datalog programs. This algorithm iteratively computes newfacts from facts that have already been established by using a forward chaining technique.,*,1990,*
Syntax and Semantics of Datalog,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,In this chapter we give an exact syntactic and semantic definition of the Datalog querylanguage. First; in Sect.6.1; we formally define several basic concepts and introduce Datalogprograms as sets of Horn clauses. We also explain important notions; such as Herbrandbase; extensional database; substitution; and unification. In Sect. 6.2; we then define the purelylogical semantics of Datalog programs by using concepts of model theory. Model theory allowsus to define the concepts of logical truth and logical consequence in a very elegant and intuitivelycompre- hensible way. Using this theory; we are able to give a precise characterization of whata Datalog program computes. However; we do not explain how the output of a Datalog programcan be computed; deferring this subject to Chap. 7. Note that Datalog is with many respects asimplified version of Logic Pro- gramming. During our discussion; we point out some of …,*,1990,*
Logic Programming and Databases: An Overview,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract This book deals with the integration of logic programming and databases togenerate new types of systems; which extend the frontiers of computer science in animportant direction and fulfil the needs of new applications. Several names are used todescribe these systems: a) The term deductive database highlights the ability to use a logicprogramming style for expressing deductions concerning the content of a database. b) Theterm knowledge base management system (KBMS) highlights the ability to manage(complex) knowledge instead of (simple) data. c) The term expert database systemhighlights the ability to use expertise in a particular application domain to solve classes ofproblems; but having access over a large database.,*,1990,*
Rewriting Methods,Stefano Ceri; Georg Gottlob; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this chapter we introduce a number of rewriting methods for Datalog programs.Section 10.1 presents rewriting methods that apply directly to Datalog programs: the MagicSets; Counting; Static Filtering and Semi-naive Evaluation by Rewriting. Section 10.2presents a structured approach to the optimization of algebraic systems; it consists of anumber of preliminary steps; after which the optimization methods of reduction of variablesand reduction of constants are applied.,*,1990,*

Process Conformance Checking by Relaxing Data Dependencies,Montserrat Estañol; Mirjana Mazuran3 Xavier Oriol; Letizia Tanca; Ernest Teniente,Abstract. Given the events modeled by a business process; it may happen in the presence ofalternative execution paths that the data required by a certain event determines somehowwhat event is executed next. Then; the process can be modeled by using an approximatefunctional dependency between the data required by both events. We apply this approach inthe context of conformance checking: given a business process model with a functionaldependency (FD) that no longer corresponds to the observed reality; we propose correctionsto the FD to make it exact or at least to improve its confidence and produce a more accuratemodel.,*,*,*
Event Recognition Strategies applied in the Mercurio Project,Davide Azzalini; Fabio Azzalini1 Davide Greco; Mirjana Mazuran; Letizia Tanca,Abstract. Mercurio is a project currently investigated at Politecnico di Milano whose aim is tosupport the decision-making process of financial investors. Mercurio identifies relevantevents both from financial news articles and financial indexes and uses sequential patternmining to predict exceptional events given their past occurrences and relationships withother events. The process of event recognition; both from textual and numerical datasources; is crucial to successfully reach the goals. Investors constantly read financial newsand analyze financial indexes; using their knowledge and experience to predict marketevents and make profitable investments. Mercurio [1; 2] aims at supporting this process byautomatically extracting; from data freely available on the Web; events that influence andshake the market.

The work described in this paperfocuses on using context to enable pervasive system personalization; allowing context-aware sensor-data tailoring. Since sensor networks; besides data collection; are also able toproduce active behaviours; the tailoring capabilities are also extended to these; thusapplying context-awareness to generic system operations. Moreover; because the numberof possible context can grow rapidly with the complexity of the application; the design phaseis also supported by the possibility to speed-up and modularize the definition of the data andoperations associated with each specific context; producing a support tool that eases the jobof the designers of modern context-aware pervasive systems.,*,*,*

A proposal for a context-aware extension of PerLa language,Letizia Tanca; Fabio A Schreiber,Abstract A context model is proposed for PerLa language; aiming at implementing context-awareness capabilities in a full declarative way. An extended survey was made beforeproposing possible solutions; in order to find out the context model adopted by similarprojects in the research environment. The dissertation continues with an analysis of what iscurrently used by the language to perform data tailoring on sensors; namely the PILOT JOINfunction; where limitations and shortcomings of the approach are pointed out and criticallypondered. A proposal of a context model is then enunciated; based on a balance betweenthe needs of PerLa and the current state of the art in contextual modelling. Context creationand management paradigms are shown in this part; along with a conceptual context modelderived from the Context-ADDICT project also developed at Politecnico di Milano.,*,*,*
