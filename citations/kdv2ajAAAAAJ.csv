A graphical query language supporting recursion,Isabel F Cruz; Alberto O Mendelzon; Peter T Wood,Abstract We define a language G for querying data represented as a labeled graph G. Byconsidering G as a relation; this graphical query language can be viewed as a relationalquery language; and its expressive power can be compared to that of other relational querylanguages. We do not propose G as an alternative to general purpose relational querylanguages; but rather as a complementary language in which recursive queries are simpleto formulate. The user is aided in this formulation by means of a graphical interface. Theprovision of regular expressions in G allows recursive queries more general than transitiveclosure to be posed; although the language is not as powerful as those based on function-free Horn clauses. However; we hope to be able to exploit well-known graph algorithms inevaluating recursive queries efficiently; a topic which has received widespread attention …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1987,284
AgreementMaker: efficient matching for large real-world schemas and ontologies,Isabel F Cruz; Flavio Palandri Antonelli; Cosmin Stroe,Abstract We present the AgreementMaker system for matching real-world schemas andontologies; which may consist of hundreds or even thousands of concepts. The end users ofthe system are sophisticated domain experts whose needs have driven the design andimplementation of the system: they require a responsive; powerful; and extensibleframework to perform; evaluate; and compare matching methods. The system comprises awide range of matching methods addressing different levels of granularity of the componentsbeing matched (conceptual vs. structural); the amount of user intervention that they require(manual vs. automatic); their usage (stand-alone vs. composed); and the types ofcomponents to consider (schema only or schema and instances). Performancemeasurements (recall; precision; and runtime) are supported by the system; along with …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,248
Strategic directions in human-computer interaction,Brad Myers; Jim Hollan; Isabel Cruz; Steve Bryson; Dick Bulterman; Tiziana Catarci; Wayne Citrin; Ephraim Glinert; Jonathan Grudin; Yannis Ioannidis,Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people design; implement; and useinteractive computer systems and how computers affect individuals; organizations; andsociety. This encompasses not only ease of use but also new interaction techniques forsupporting user tasks; providing better access to information; and creating more powerfulforms of communication. It involves input and output devices and the interaction techniquesthat use them; how information is presented and requested; how the computer's actions arecontrolled and monitored; all forms of help; documentation; and training; the tools used todesign; build; test; and evaluate user interfaces; and the processes that developers followwhen creating interfaces.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,237
An ontology-based framework for XML semantic integration,IR Cruz; Huiyong Xiao; Feihong Hsu,XML is becoming the standard for data interchange on the Web. However; XML and itsschema languages do not express semantics but rather structure; such as nestinginformation. Therefore; semantically equivalent documents often present different documentstructures. We provide an ontology-based framework that aims to make two XML documentsintemperate at the semantic level while retaining their nesting structure. In our global-as-view approach; we generate an RDF ontology for each of the participating XML documents;which preserves the nesting structure of the document. An RDF global ontology is the resultof merging the individual ontologies. The global ontology unifies the query access andestablishes semantic connections among the underlying individual databases. We considertwo types of queries: those that are posed on the global ontology and those that are …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004. IDEAS'04. Proceedings. International,2004,151

The role of ontologies in data integration,Isabel F Cruz; Huiyong Xiao,Abstract In this paper; we discuss the use of ontologies for data integration. We consider twodifferent settings depending on the system architecture: central and peer-to-peer dataintegration. Within those settings; we discuss five different cases studies that illustrate theuse of ontologies in metadata representation; in global conceptualization; in high-levelquerying; in declarative mediation; and in mapping support. Each case study is described indetail and accompanied by examples.,Engineering intelligent systems for electrical engineering and communications,2005,139
DOODLE: a visual language for object-oriented databases,Isabel F Cruz,Abstract In this paper we introduce DOODLE; a new visual and declarative language forobject-oriented databases. The main principle behind the language is that it is possible todisplay and query the database with arbitrary pictures. We allow the user to tailor the displayof the data to suit the application at hand or her preferences. We want the user-definedvisualizations to be stored in the database; and the language to express all kinds of visualmanipulations. For extendibility reasons; the language is object-oriented. The semantics ofthe language is given by a well-known deductive query language for object-orienteddatabases. We hope that the formal basis of our language will contribute to the theoreticalstudy of database visualizations and visual query languages; a subject that we believe is ofgreat interest; but largely left unexplored.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,129
The agreementmakerlight ontology matching system,Daniel Faria; Catia Pesquita; Emanuel Santos; Matteo Palmonari; Isabel F Cruz; Francisco M Couto,Abstract AgreementMaker is one of the leading ontology matching systems; thanks to itscombination of a flexible and extensible framework with a comprehensive user interface. Inmany domains; such as the biomedical; ontologies are becoming increasingly large thuspresenting new challenges. We have developed a new core framework;AgreementMakerLight; focused on computational efficiency and designed to handle verylarge ontologies; while preserving most of the flexibility and extensibility of the originalAgreementMaker framework. We evaluated the efficiency of AgreementMakerLight in twoOAEI tracks: Anatomy and Large Biomedical Ontologies; obtaining excellent run time results.In addition; for the Anatomy track; AgreementMakerLight is now the best system asmeasured in terms of F-measure.

Continuous probabilistic nearest-neighbor queries for uncertain trajectories,Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia; Hui Ding; Peter Scheuermann; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract This work addresses the problem of processing continuous nearest neighbor (NN)queries for moving objects trajectories when the exact position of a given object at aparticular time instant is not known; but is bounded by an uncertainty region. As has alreadybeen observed in the literature; the answers to continuous NN-queries in spatio-temporalsettings are time parameterized in the sense that the objects in the answer vary over time.Incorporating uncertainty in the model yields additional attributes that affect the semantics ofthe answer to this type of queries. In this work; we formalize the impact of uncertainty on theanswers to the continuous probabilistic NN-queries; provide a compact structure for theirrepresentation and efficient algorithms for constructing that structure. We also identifysyntactic constructs for several qualitative variants of continuous probabilistic NN-queries …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,88
A role and attribute based access control system using semantic web technologies,Lorenzo Cirio; Isabel F Cruz; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract We show how Semantic Web technologies can be used to build an access controlsystem. We follow the role-based access control approach (RBAC) and extend it withcontextual attributes. Our approach provides for the dynamic association of roles with users.A Description Logic (DL) reasoner is used to classify both users and resources; and verifythe consistency of the access control policies. We mitigate the limited expressive power ofthe DL formalism by refining the output of the DL reasoner with SPARQL queries. Finally; weprovide a proof-of-concept implementation of the system written in Java. TM,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,77
Structural alignment methods with applications to geospatial ontologies,Isabel F Cruz; William Sunna,Abstract We consider the problem of enabling interoperability and information sharingamong geospatial applications that use ontologies to describe their concepts and therelationships among them. We present two fully automatic alignment methods that use thegraph structures of a pair of ontologies to establish their alignment; that is; the semanticcorrespondences between their concepts. We have tested our methods on geospatialontologies pertaining to wetlands and four other pairs that belong to a repository that hasbeen used in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). Using these ontologies;we have compared the effectiveness (precision and recall) of our methods against theSimilarity Flooding Algorithm that was proposed by others and show that for each of thetested ontologies one of our methods is at least as effective as their method.

Efficient selection of mappings and automatic quality-driven combination of matching methods,Isabel F Cruz; Flavio Palandri Antonelli; Cosmin Stroe,Abstract. The AgreementMaker system for ontology matching includes an extensiblearchitecture that facilitates the integration and performance tuning of a variety of matchingmethods; an evaluation mechanism; which can make use of a reference matching or relysolely on “inherent” quality measures; and a multi-purpose user interface; which drives boththe matching methods and the evaluation strategies. In this paper; we focus on two mainfeatures of AgreementMaker. The former is an optimized method that performs the selectionof mappings given the similarities between entities computed by any matching algorithm; athreshold value; and the desired cardinalities of the mappings. Experiments show that ourmethod is more efficient than the typically adopted combinatorial method. The latter is theevaluation framework; which includes three “inherent” quality measures that can be used …,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Ontology Matching-Volume 551,2009,72
Handling semantic heterogeneities using declarative agreements,Isabel F Cruz; Afsheen Rajendran; William Sunna; Nancy Wiegand,Abstract The focus of this paper is on interoperability issues to achieve data integration indistributed databases for geographic applications. Our concrete application is in the contextof the State of Wisconsin Land Information System (WLIS). In WLIS; data is stored in XMLusing independently maintained local databases. However; answers to many queries mustspan several databases. Our approach is based on the existence of a central ontology andon declarative transformations; called\it agreements; between the schemas of the localdatabases and the central ontology. Using our approach; end users can seamlessly queryand aggregate semantically related data that is available throughout the state using a visualinterface. An expert at the site of the local database uses another visual interface to specifythe agreement between that database and the ontology.

A visual tool for ontology alignment to enable geospatial interoperability,Isabel F Cruz; William Sunna; Nalin Makar; Sujan Bathala,Abstract In distributed geospatial applications with heterogeneous databases; an ontology-driven approach to data integration relies on the alignment of the concepts of a globalontology that describe the domain; with the concepts of the ontologies that describe the datain the distributed databases. Once the alignment between the global ontology and eachdistributed ontology is established; agreements that encode a variety of mappings betweenconcepts are derived. In this way; users can potentially query hundreds of geospatialdatabases using a single query. Using our approach; querying can be easily extended tonew data sources and; therefore; to new regions. In this paper; we describe theAgreementMaker; a tool that displays the ontologies; supports several mapping layersvisually; presents automatically generated mappings; and finally produces the …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2007,71
3d graph drawing with simulated annealing,Isabel F Cruz; Joseph P Twarog,Abstract A recent trend in graph drawing is directed to the visualization of graphs in 3D [1; 5;6]. A promising research direction concerns the extension of proven 2D techniques to 3D.We present a system extending the simulated annealing algorithm of Davidson and Harel [2]for straight-line two-dimensional drawings of general undirected graphs to three dimensions.This system features an advanced 3D user interface that assists the user in choosing andmodifying the cost function and the optimization components on-line.,International Symposium on Graph Drawing,1995,67
Semi-automatic ontology alignment for geospatial data integration,Isabel F Cruz; William Sunna; Anjli Chaudhry,Abstract In geospatial applications with heterogeneous databases; an ontology-drivenapproach to data integration relies on the alignment of the concepts of a global ontology thatdescribe the domain; with the concepts of the ontologies that describe the data in the localdatabases. Once the alignment between the global ontology and each local ontology isestablished; users can potentially query hundreds of databases using a single query thathides the underlying heterogeneities. Using our approach; querying can be easily extendedto a new data source by aligning a local ontology with the global one. For this purpose; wehave designed and implemented a tool to align ontologies. The output of this tool is a set ofmappings between concepts; which will be used to produce the queries to the localdatabases once a query is formulated on the global ontology.

Visualizing queries and querying visualizations,Mariano P Consens; Isabel F Cruz; Alberto O Mendelzon,Suppose you are flipping channels on a TV set and flip into the middle of a film that you haveseen before. Most people can; within a few seconds; identify the film; recall the title and mainactors; and predict what is going to happen next. Alan Kay [Kay91] gives this example toshow the remarkable powers of storage and retrieval of visual information that humanbeings have. We may perhaps one day be able to duplicate some of this power in ourcomputing machines; although the challenges are enormous; in the meantime; computersystems that manage; retrieve and manipulate information should be designed to play to thestrengths of human information processing capabilities.

Peer-to-peer semantic integration of XML and RDF data sources,Isabel F Cruz; Huiyong Xiao; Feihong Hsu,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) data management systems combine traditional schema-basedintegration techniques with the P2P infrastructure. In this paper; we propose a P2P datamanagement framework named PEPSINT that semantically integrates heterogeneous XMLand RDF data sources; using a hybrid architecture and a global-as-view approach. Ourfocus is on the query processing techniques over heterogeneous data. Queries in PEPSINTare expressed in XQuery and in RDQL. We consider two types of queries; depending onwhether the query is first posed on the super peer or on one of the peers.,International Workshop on Agents and P2P Computing,2004,61

Integrating and exchanging XML data using ontologies,Huiyong Xiao; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract While providing a uniform syntax and a semistructured data model; XML does notexpress semantics but only structure such as nesting information. In this paper; we considerthe problem of data integration and interoperation of heterogeneous XML sources and usean ontology-based framework to address this problem at a semantic level. Ontologies areextensively used for domain knowledge representation; by virtue of their conceptualizationof the domain; which carries explicit semantics. In our approach; the global ontology isexpressed in RDF Schema (RDFS) and constructed using the global-as-view approach bymerging individual local ontologies; which represent XML source schemas. We provide aformal model for the mappings between XML schemas and local RDFS ontologies andthose between local ontologies and the global RDFS ontology. We consider two cases of …,*,2006,45

AgreementMakerLight results for OAEI 2013.,Daniel Faria; Catia Pesquita; Emanuel Santos; Isabel F Cruz; Francisco M Couto,Abstract. AgreementMakerLight (AML) is an automated ontology matching framework basedon element-level matching and the use of external resources as background knowledge.This paper describes the configuration of AML for the OAEI 2013 competition and discussesits results. Being a newly developed and still incomplete system; our focus in this year'sOAEI were the anatomy and large biomedical ontologies tracks; wherein backgroundknowledge plays a critical role. Nevertheless; AML was fairly successful in other tracks aswell; showing that in many ontology matching tasks; a lightweight approach based solely onelement-level matching can compete with more complex approaches.,OM,2013,41
A data model for trip planning in multimodal transportation systems,Joel Booth; Prasad Sistla; Ouri Wolfson; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract This paper introduces the problem of modeling urban transportation systems in adatabase where certain aspects of the data are probabilistic in nature. The transportationnetwork is composed of multiple modes (eg; automobile; bus; train; pedestrian) that the usercan alternate between. A trip--a path between an origin and destination subject to someconstraints--is the central concept. How these trips and the network can be represented asboth a graph and relational model; as well as the requirements for querying are the maincontributions of this paper. A set of operators are defined to work over these transportationconcepts and they are integrated within a SQL-like syntax to express queries over theuncertain transportation network. Additionally; the paper shows how this model can beintegrated within other moving objects and spatio-temporal data models; and how these …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,41
Semantic data integration in hierarchical domains,Isabel F Cruz; Afsheen Rajendran,A major challenge in building the Semantic Web is resolving differences amongheterogeneous databases. This article describes one approach for handling semantic dataintegration problems in hierarchical domains. It also describes a declarative approach forspecifying pairwise mappings between a centrally maintained ontology and each local datarepository maintained by an autonomous agency. In this context; it outlines a method forspecifying the mappings' semantics and encoding them to resolve heterogeneities. Itfocuses on XML-based applications in which entities in the centrally maintained ontologyare hierarchically related to those in the local data repositories.,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2003,41
Measuring structural similarity among web documents: preliminary results,Isabel F Cruz; Slava Borisov; Michael A Marks; Timothy R Webb,Abstract When we describe a Web page informally; we often use phrases like “it looks like anewspaper site”;“there are several unordered lists” or “it's just a collection of links”.Unfortunately; no Web search or classification tools provide the capability to retrieveinformation using such informal descriptions that are based on the appearance; ie; structure;of the Web page. In this paper; we take a look at the concept of structurally similar Webpages. We note that some structural properties can be identified with semantic properties ofthe data and provide measures for comparison between HTML documents.,*,1998,41
Ontology driven data integration in heterogeneous networks,Isabel F Cruz; Huiyong Xiao,Abstract We propose a layered framework for the integration of syntactically; schematically;and semantically heterogeneous networked data sources. Their heterogeneity stems fromdifferent models (eg; relational; XML; or RDF); different schemas within the same model; anddifferent terms associated with the same meaning. We use a semantic based approach thatuses a global ontology to mediate among the schemas of the data sources. In ourframework; a query is expressed in terms of one of the data sources or of the global ontologyand is then translated into subqueries on the other data sources using mappings based on acommon vocabulary. Metadata representation; global conceptualization; declarativemediation; mapping support; and query processing are addressed in detail in our discussionof a case study.,*,2009,38
Interactive user feedback in ontology matching using signature vectors,Isabel F Cruz; Cosmin Stroe; Matteo Palmonari,When compared to a gold standard; the set of mappings that are generated by an automaticontology matching process is neither complete nor are the individual mappings alwayscorrect. However; given the explosion in the number; size; and complexity of availableontologies; domain experts no longer have the capability to create ontology mappingswithout considerable effort. We present a solution to this problem that consists of making theontology matching process interactive so as to incorporate user feedback in the loop. Ourapproach clusters mappings to identify where user feedback will be most beneficial inreducing the number of user interactions and system iterations. This feedback process hasbeen implemented in the Agreement Maker system and is supported by visual analytictechniques that help users to better understand the matching process.

In particular; wesolve the problem of translating queries on a database schema into queries on anotherdatabase schema; using their relationship with an ontology. We use RDF schema to modelthe databases and the ontology. A common vocabulary expresses the mappings betweeneach database schema and the ontology.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2003.

Drawing graphs by example efficiently: Trees and planar acyclic digraphs,Isabel F Cruz; Ashim Garg,Abstract Constraint-based graph drawing systems provide expressive power and flexibility.Previously proposed approaches make use of general constraint solvers; which areinefficient; and of textual specification of constraints; which can be long and difficult tounderstand. In this paper we propose the use of a constraint-based visual language forconstructing planar drawings of trees; series-parallel graphs; and acyclic digraphs in lineartime. A graph drawing system based on our approach can therefore provide the power ofconstraint-based graph drawing; the simplicity of visual specifications; and thecomputational efficiency that is typical of the algorithmic-based approaches.,International Symposium on Graph Drawing,1994,32
Structure-based methods to enhance geospatial ontology alignment,William Sunna; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract In geospatial applications with heterogeneous classification schemes that describerelated domains; an ontology-driven approach to data sharing and interoperability relies onthe alignment of concepts across different ontologies. To enable scalability both in the sizeand the number of the ontologies involved; the alignment method should be automatic. Inthis paper; we propose two fully automatic alignment methods that use the structure of theontology graphs for contextual information; thus providing the matching process with moresemantics. We have tested our methods on a set of geospatial ontologies pertaining to thedomain of wetlands and on four sets that belong to an ontology repository that is becomingthe standard for testing ontology alignment techniques. We have compared the effectivenessand efficiency of the proposed methods against two previous approaches. The …,International Conference on GeoSpatial Sematics,2007,31

The answer to an NN query for certain trajectories is timeparameterized due to the continuous nature of the motion. As a consequence of uncertainty;there may be several objects that have a non-zero probability of being a nearest neighbor toa given querying object; and the continuous nature further complicates the semantics of theanswer. We capture the impact that the uncertainty of the trajectories has on the semantics ofthe answer to continuous NN queries and we propose a tree structure for representing theanswers; along with efficient algorithms to compute them. We also address the issue ofperforming NN queries when the motion of the objects is restricted to road networks. Finally;we formally define and show how to efficiently execute several variants of continuous NN …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,26

A constraint and attribute based security framework for dynamic role assignment in collaborative environments,Isabel F Cruz; Rigel Gjomemo; Benjamin Lin; Mirko Orsini,Abstract We investigate a security framework for collaborative applications that relies on therole-based access control (RBAC) model. In our framework; roles are pre-defined andorganized in a hierarchy (partial order). However; we assume that users are not previouslyidentified; therefore the actions that they can perform are dynamically determined based ontheir own attribute values and on the attribute values associated with the resources. Thosevalues can vary over time (eg; the user's location or whether the resource is open for visiting)thus enabling or disabling a user's ability to perform an action on a particular resource. Inour framework; constraint values form partial orders and determine the association of actionswith the resources and of users with roles. We have implemented our framework byexploring the capabilities of semantic web technologies; and in particular of OWL 1.1; to …,International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing,2008,22
A location aware role and attribute based access control system,Isabel F Cruz; Rigel Gjomemo; Benjamin Lin; Mirko Orsini,Abstract In this paper; we follow the role-based access control (RBAC) approach and extendit to provide for the dynamic association of roles with users. In our framework; privilegesassociated with resources are assigned depending on the attribute values of the resources;attribute values associated with users determine the association of users with privileges; anda location mapping function between physical and logical locations allows to enable/disableroles depending on the logical location of the users and thus preserve the privacy of thelocation. We use Semantic Web technologies and a graphical user interface based on theGoogle Maps API.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,22
Towards" On the Go" Matching of Linked Open Data Ontologies.,Isabel F Cruz; Matteo Palmonari; Federico Caimi; Cosmin Stroe,Abstract Creating links between the schemas of published datasets is a key part of theLinked Open Data (LOD) paradigm. The ability to discover these links “on the go” requiresfor ontology matching techniques to achieve sufficient precision and recall within acceptableexecution times. In this paper we add two methods to the AgreementMaker ontologymatching system (but that could be used together with other systems). A first method consistsof discovering a set of high-quality equivalence mappings based on concept similarity and ofinferring subclass mappings from that set. A second method is based on the adoption ofbackground terminology that serves as a mediator. Sets of synonyms and a hierarchy ofconcepts are taken into account; as well as subclass relationships involving externalconcepts that are imported into the ontologies being matched. Experimental results show …,LDH,2011,21
Semantic Mappings for the Integration of XML and RDF Sources,Huiyong Xiao; Isabel F Cruz; Feihong Hsu,Abstract. A huge amount of data on the Web may be heterogeneous with respect to syntax;schemata and semantics. For instance; XML and RDF provide two completely differentparadigms for modeling Web data. In this paper; we focus on the issue of mappingrepresentations in an ontology-based framework that aims at integrating XML and RDFsources. We propose a solution that utilizes a new mapping language called RDF MappingSchema; which is a meta-schema defined on top of RDF Schema.,Proc. of IIWEB-2004,2004,21
A user interface for distributed multimedia database querying with mediator supported refinement,Isabel F Cruz; Kimberly M James,The Delaunay/sup MM/system supports an interactive; customizable interface for queryingmultimedia distributed databases; such as digital libraries. Through this interface; usersselect virtual document styles that cater the display of query results to their needs; while alsooffering transparent preand post-query refinement and querying. Delaunay/sup MM/'s virtualdocuments preserve context by maintaining a single customizable interface for resultviewing. The advanced transparent query features rely on mediation to provide adeptaccess to information.

Information visualization,Tiziana Catarci; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract Information visualization; an increasingly important subdiscipline within the field ofHuman Computer Interaction (HCI)[13]; focuses on visual mechanisms designed tocommunicate clearly to the user the structure of information and improve on the cost ofaccess to large data repositories. In printed form; information visualization has included thedisplay of numerical data (eg; bar charts; plot charts; pie charts); combinatorial relations (eg;drawings of graphs); and geographic data (eg; encoded maps)[1; 9; 16]. In addition to these“static” displays; computer-based systems; such as the Information Visualizer [2] andDynamic Queries [15] have coupled powerful visualization techniques (eg; constraints; 3D;animation) with near real-time interactivity; ie; the ability of the system to respond quickly tothe user's direct manipulation commands. Another important aspect of computer-based …,ACM Sigmod Record,1996,20
User-defined visual query languages,Isabel F Cruz,Previous research in visual query languages has focused on pre-defined visualrepresentations of data and queries; which are suitable for specific applications; but difficultto extend and generalize. We propose a meta-language to query an object-orienteddatabase with user-defined pictures. By manipulating these pictures; the user can extractinformation about the data in a purely visual fashion. The proposed meta-language is rule-based and uses a constraint visual language that allows for complex displays such asgraphs; bar charts; pie charts; and plot charts to be specified. Our approach extends object-oriented concepts; such as inheritance and genericity to visual query languages. We provideexamples that illustrate the expressiveness of the user-defined visual languages to displayand query data.,Visual Languages; 1994. Proceedings.; IEEE Symposium on,1994,20
Building linked ontologies with high precision using subclass mapping discovery,Isabel F Cruz; Matteo Palmonari; Federico Caimi; Cosmin Stroe,Abstract The creation of links between schemas of published datasets is a key part of theLinked Open Data (LOD) paradigm. The ability to discover these links “on the go” requiresthat ontology matching techniques achieve good precision and recall within acceptableexecution times. In this paper; we add similarity-based and mediator-based ontologymatching methods to the Agreementmaker ontology matching system; which aim toefficiently discover high precision subclass mappings between LOD ontologies. Similarity-based matching methods discover subclass mappings by extrapolating them from a set ofhigh quality equivalence mappings and from the interpretation of compound concept names.Mediator-based matching methods discover subclass mappings by comparing polysemiclexical annotations of ontology concepts and by considering external web ontologies …,Artificial Intelligence Review,2013,18
As you like it: Personalized database visualization using a visual language,Isabel F Cruz; Peter S Leveille,Abstract The Delaunay system supports a visual language that is specifically geared to thequerying and visualization of databases. In this paper; we concentrate on the informationvisualization capabilities of the system. A distinctive feature of Delaunay is its fullpersonalization capabilities: users can define their visualizations from scratch withoutlimiting themselves to pre-defined visualization modes. Fine customization of thevisualization is achieved by the availability of a visual alphabet of atomic graphical symbolsand by the expressive power of the visual query language; which supports recursion. Wedescribe the key components of the Delaunay system; namely its interface modules; whichsupport advanced visualization techniques and principles; and its efficient constraint solver.The successful implementation of Delaunay demonstrates the feasibility of a powerful …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2001,18
Foundations of the DARE system for drawing adequate representations,Tiziana Catarci; Giuseppe Santucci; Maria Francesca Costabile; Isabel Cruz,We consider the problem of automatically visualizing information contained in a databaseand propose a framework that addresses the issues involved. Our approach does notdepend on the particular data model used; the size of the instance set; or the nature of thedata being represented. The aim of the framework is to produce a correct; complete; andpossibly highly effective visual representation. Such properties of the visual representationare made possible by the consistency of a set of logic rules contained in a knowledge base.These rules express facts and relationships about the visual domain; the data domain; themapping between both domains; and the perceptual domain.,Database Applications in Non-Traditional Environments; 1999.(DANTE'99) Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on,1999,18
Automatic background knowledge selection for matching biomedical ontologies,Daniel Faria; Catia Pesquita; Emanuel Santos; Isabel F Cruz; Francisco M Couto,Ontology matching is a growing field of research that is of critical importance for the semanticweb initiative. The use of background knowledge for ontology matching is often a key factorfor success; particularly in complex and lexically rich domains such as the life sciences.However; in most ontology matching systems; the background knowledge sources are eitherpredefined by the system or have to be provided by the user. In this paper; we present anovel methodology for automatically selecting background knowledge sources for any givenontologies to match. This methodology measures the usefulness of each backgroundknowledge source by assessing the fraction of classes mapped through it over thosemapped directly; which we call the mapping gain. We implemented this methodology in theAgreementMakerLight ontology matching framework; and evaluate it using the …,PloS one,2014,17
Ontology alignment for real-world applications,Isabel F Cruz; William Sunna; Anjli Chaudhry,Abstract An ontology-driven approach to data integration relies on the alignment of theconcepts of a global ontology that describe the domain; with the concepts of the ontologiesthat describe the data in the local databases. Once the alignment between the globalontology and each of the local ontologies is established; users can potentially queryhundreds of databases using a single query that hides the underlying heterogeneities.Using our approach; querying can be easily extended to a new database by aligning itsontology with the global one. For this purpose; we have designed and implemented asoftware tool to align ontologies. The output of this tool is a set of mappings betweenconcepts; which will be used to produce the queries to the local databases once a query isformulated on the global ontology.,Proceedings of the 2004 annual national conference on Digital government research,2004,17

Evaluating Web page color and layout adaptations,David C.  Brown; Esteban Burbano; Joel Minski; IE Cruz,An adaptive Web site molds itself to the user; creating a unique interaction; providing a moreenjoyable experience; and increasing the success of an interaction. We studied the effect ofWeb page adaptations on information-finding tasks. Although many user interfacecomponents; such as page content and Web links; can be altered to produce adaptations;we limited our work exclusively to altering color and layout. The hypothesis we studied in ourresearch was that these adaptations would let users complete tasks in a shorter time andthat this effect would occur whether the adaptations were used individually or together. Wedesigned a Web-based experiment that required each subject to answer three questions.The subjects could find the answer for each by searching through a local copy of a portion ofIBM's 2000 Sydney Olympics Web site.

What’s in a ‘nym’? Synonyms in Biomedical Ontology Matching,Catia Pesquita; Daniel Faria; Cosmin Stroe; Emanuel Santos; Isabel F Cruz; Francisco M Couto,Abstract To bring the Life Sciences domain closer to a Semantic Web realization it isfundamental to establish meaningful relations between biomedical ontologies. Thesuccessful application of ontology matching techniques is strongly tied to an effectiveexploration of the complex and diverse biomedical terminology contained in biomedicalontologies. In this paper; we present an overview of the lexical components of severalbiomedical ontologies and investigate how different approaches for their use can impact theperformance of ontology matching techniques. We propose novel approaches for exploringthe different types of synonyms encoded by the ontologies and for extending them basedboth on internal synonym derivation and on external ontologies.

Privacy-preserving schema matching using mutual information,Isabel F Cruz; Roberto Tamassia; Danfeng Yao,Abstract The problem of schema or ontology matching is to define mappings among schemaor ontology elements. Such mappings are typically defined between two schemas or twoontologies at a time. Ideally; using the defined mappings; one would be able to issue asingle query that will be rewritten automatically to all the databases; instead of manuallywriting a query to each database. In a centrally mediated architecture a query is written interms of a global schema or ontology that integrates all the database schemas or ontologies;while in a peer-to-peer architecture a query is written in terms of the schema or of theontology of any of the peer databases.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2007,15

Temporal synchronization in multimedia presentations,Isabel F Cruz; Parag S Mahalley,Designing high quality multimedia presentations is a tedious and time consuming task; evenfor skilled authors. This is particularly true when temporal media such as speech andanimation are involved. The focus of our research is to determine whether the multimediapresentation is synchronized or amenable to synchronization. We define a formal frameworkfor verifying temporal synchronization of a presentation; which is based on a modified all-pairs shortest path algorithm.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1999.

Automatic configuration selection using ontology matching task profiling,Isabel F Cruz; Alessio Fabiani; Federico Caimi; Cosmin Stroe; Matteo Palmonari,Abstract An ontology matching system can usually be run with different configurations thatoptimize the system's effectiveness; namely precision; recall; or F-measure; depending onthe specific ontologies to be aligned. Changing the configuration has potentially high impacton the obtained results. We apply matching task profiling metrics to automatically optimizethe system's configuration depending on the characteristics of the ontologies to be matched.Using machine learning techniques; we can automatically determine the optimalconfiguration in most cases. Even using a small training set; our system determines the bestconfiguration in 94% of the cases. Our approach is evaluated using the AgreementMakerontology matching system; which is extensible and configurable.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2012,14
BLOOMS on AgreementMaker: Results for OAEI 2010,Catia Pesquita; Cosmin Stroe; Isabel F Cruz; Francisco M Couto,Abstract. BLOOMS is an ontology matching method developed as part of an ontologyextension system for biomedical ontologies. It combines two lexical similarity measures withsimilarity propagation. These matchers are applied sequentially; following their precisionyield: first lexical similarity based on exact matches; followed by partial matches; and finallythese similarities are propagated throughout the ontologies. Partial matches are based onthe specificity of words within the ontologies vocabularies. Semantic propagation ofsimilarities is made according to the semantic distance between ontology concepts given bysemantic similarity measures. Alignments are extracted after each matcher; to favorprecision; since BLOOMS was specifically designed to be as automated as possible. For theparticipation in OAEI 2010 BLOOMS was integrated into the AgreementMaker system …,Ontology Matching,2010,14
A layered framework supporting personal information integration and application design for the semantic desktop,Isabel F Cruz; Huiyong Xiao,Abstract With the development of inexpensive storage devices; space usage is no longer abottleneck for computer users. However; the increasingly large amount of personalinformation poses a critical problem to those users: traditional file organization inhierarchical directories may not be suited to the effective management of personalinformation because it ignores the semantic associations therein and bears no connectionwith the applications that users will run. To address such limitations; we present our vision ofa semantic desktop; which relies on the use of ontologies to annotate and organize data andon the concept of personal information application (PIA); which is associated with a user'stask. The PIA designer is the tool that is provided for building a variety of PIAs consisting ofviews (eg; text; list; table; graph); which are spatially arranged and display interrelated …,The VLDB Journal,2008,14

Concept level matching of geospatial ontologies,Isabel F Cruz; William G Sunna; Kalyan Ayloo,In this paper we describe an ontology-based approach to bridge the semantic gap amongdistributed geospatial data. We assume that there is an ontology associated with eachdatabase that describes the hierarchical relationship between the database concepts.Because such ontologies are created independently from one another; they areheterogeneous. In particular; we focus on semantic heterogeneity; which arises whendifferent terms are used to describe the same concept or when the same term is used todescribe different concepts [3]. Our contribution is to the alignment process; which enablesexperts to establish mappings between related concepts in different ontologies; thusallowing for the integration of data across multiple databases. For example; using thosemappings; a query to one of the databases can be translated to a query to any of the other …,GIS Planet International Conference and Exhibition on Geographic Information,2005,14

Notably; it obtainedthe highest F-measure in all tasks of the Interactive Matching track while posing less queriesto the user than comparable participating systems.,OM,2015,13
A tree-structured query interface for querying semi-structured data,Scott Newman; Z Meral Ozsoyoglu,XML is a semistructured data format that is quickly becoming the standard means ofcommunication across the Internet. We introduce a simple; powerful; unambiguous tree-structured user-interface for querying semistructured data. It emphasizes ease-of-use andprovides generic access to XML repositories. An implementation of this interface called thePathways Explorer has been built in the context of biological pathways. The implementationillustrates some basic capabilities; such as selection; projection; equijoins; and self-joins. Itbuilds efficient queries using SQL; and it has been shown that XQuery's performance wouldbe comparable. Future implementations might allow semantic client-side caching;aggregation and grouping; recursion; and set operations.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004.

It will be a distributed Web-based system withheterogeneous data residing on local and state servers. One of the most important functionsfor WLIS is to integrate land use data across jurisdictions to enable decision-making forcomprehensive land use planning. Here; we describe the semantic problems of integratingland use codes. We then present the current state of our enhancements to an XML queryengine to provide query processing over heterogeneous data sets.

Pay-as-you-go multi-user feedback model for ontology matching,Isabel F Cruz; Francesco Loprete; Matteo Palmonari; Cosmin Stroe; Aynaz Taheri,Abstract Using our multi-user model; a community of users provides feedback in a pay-as-you-go fashion to the ontology matching process by validating the mappings found byautomatic methods; with the following advantages over having a single user: the effortrequired from each user is reduced; user errors are corrected; and consensus is reached.We propose strategies that dynamically determine the order in which the candidatemappings are presented to the users for validation. These strategies are based on mappingquality measures that we define. Further; we use a propagation method to leverage thevalidation of one mapping to other mappings. We use an extension of the AgreementMakerontology matching system and the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)Benchmarks track to evaluate our approach.

Spatial queries in disconnected mobile networks,Xinjuan Zhu; Bo Xu; Ouri Wolfson,Abstract In this paper we study in-network query processing in disconnected mobileenvironments; where both ad-hoc communication and infrastructure communication areavailable. Depending on how the infrastructure is utilized; various query-processingschemes are classified. Analytical models are developed to compute the average delay andthe average energy consumption for each of these schemes. Based on the analyticalmodels; the query processing schemes are compared under various environmentconditions. It is found that none of the studied schemes is optimal in all the conditions.Therefore the paper provides a method that allows the optimal scheme to be chosen for agiven set of environmental conditions.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,12

Tremendous amounts of data exist in life sciences along with many bio! ontologies.Though these databases contain important information about gene; proteins; functions; etc.;this information is not well utilized due to the heterogeneous formats of these databases.Therefore; ontology alignment (OA) is now very critical for life science domains. Our workutilizes AgreementMaker for OA and describes results; difficulties faced in the process; andlessons learned. We aligned two real! world ontologies; the Parasite Experiment Ontology(PEO) and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). The former is more application!oriented and the latter is a reference ontology for any biomedical or clinical investigations.Our study led to several enhancements to AgreementMaker: annotation profiling; mappingprovenance information; and tailored lexicon building.

Visual Analytics for Ontology Matching Using Multi-linked Views.,Jillian Aurisano; Amruta Nanavaty; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract. Ontology matching is the key to data integration on the Semantic Web. Advancedontology matching systems incorporate a variety of algorithms. However; they do not alwaysguarantee a complete and correct alignment (set of mappings). Hence; user involvement inthe matching process is essential for complex ontologies. In this paper; we explore thepower of multi-linked views; where actions in one view affect the display of the other views;thereby extending significantly the state of the art in ontology matching visualization ingeneral and that of visual analytics for ontology matching in particular.

Thetemporal threshold for the Quality of Data (QoD) tolerance is specified with respect to thetime that it takes for the packets to travel from the source to the sink along an optimal route.For these settings; we propose a methodology that enables controlling the spatio-temporalload balancing among the sensors around the optimal route. Given the QoD threshold; weuse it to derive a set of parameterized Bezier curves which serve as alternate routesbetween the (source; sink) pair; relieving the nodes along the optimal route; while ensuringa bound on the delay of packets delivery. We provide experimental results whichdemonstrate that our proposed methodology can prolong the sensor networks' lifetime for …,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

A layered architecture for the exploration of heterogeneous information using coordinated views,Isabel F Cruz; Yuan Feng Huang,In a real-world decision support application; users often want to search data from varioussources according to some criteria; build a visualization based on the data being retrieved;and use the visualization to explore the data. With our approach; these activities aresupported within the same workspace. Views are dynamically created by binding each dataset to a visualization template according to the user's preferences. The resulting views arethen arranged into a larger coordinated view. In our layered architecture; dataflows throughthe layers becoming encapsulated inside of metadata that describes the visual attributesbeing added; this metadata determines both the individual views and the dynamicinteractions within a coordinated view. Dynamic interactions are implemented using amediated notification services architecture,Visual Languages and Human Centric Computing; 2004 IEEE Symposium on,2004,9
RDF-based metadata management in peer-to-peer systems,Huiyong Xiao; I Cruz,Abstract. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) data integration combines the P2P infrastructure with traditionalschema-based data integration techniques. One of the primary problems in this researcharea is the automation of the process of interoperation among heterogeneous data sources.To facilitate this process; metadata are used to add rich semantics to the data sources. In thispaper; we propose an RDF-based layered approach to data interoperation in a P2Penvironment. We use RDF and its vocabulary language RDFS for representation of data andmetadata; which are distributed in different peers. For the representation of the mappings ofmetadata from peer to peer (called P2P mappings); we propose a mapping language; whichis an RDF-based meta-ontology (called RDFMS) that enables metadata management in adecentralized way. We also discuss a thesaurus-based mapping process and query …,Proceedings of the 2nd IST Workshop on Metadata Management in Grid and P2P Systems (MMGPS); London,2004,9
Exploring a new approach to the alignment of ontologies,Isabel F Cruz; Afsheen Rajendran,Abstract We address the issue of data integration over semantically-heterogeneous datasources using an ontology-based integration mechanism. The semiautomatic techniquesthat we explore are directed to helping experts establish mappings between ontologiesusing a combination of manual methods; which are needed for the accuracy of themappings; and automatic methods; which facilitate the experts' tasks. We illustrate ourapproach using examples from a geospatial application for querying land use patterns in theState of Wisconsin.,ISWC Workshop on Semantic Web Technologies for Searching and Retrieving Scientific Data,2003,9
Object interoperability for geospatial applications,Paul W Calnan; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract. In this paper; we analyze a geospatial application for visualizing US electionresults in order to show the problems that need to be solved in the mapping betweendifferent XML representations and their conceptual models. We propose a framework thatprovides a number of core classes that allow applications to treat XML documents as graphsand to evaluate XPath expressions against such document graphs. We also propose amechanism that allows information to be exchanged between document types. Our goal is toultimately attain an overall framework for interoperation where maintenance problems areminimized. To achieve this; we anticipate the need for introducing metadata in the semanticlayer that will guide the translation process between document types.,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Semantic Web Working,2001,9
Tailorable information visualization,Isabel F Cruz,Abstract: Information visualization is emerging as one of the most important topics in human-computer interaction. Existing systems have been successful at providing automatic ways todisplay information using sophisticated rendering techniques (eg; 3D; animation). We arguefor tools with which users can adapt visualizations to the application at hand and to their ownpreferences. Ideally; such tools should combine user-defined displays with automaticallygenerated displays and be integrated with search mechanisms capable of accessing data ina variety of information bases (eg; digital libraries; the WWW; databases). A combined effortof researchers in human-computer interaction and in information systems is thereforeneeded.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,9
A visual approach to graph drawing,Isabel F Cruz; Roberto Tamassia; Pascal Van Hentenryck,Work in graph drawing has traditionally focused on algorithmic approaches; where thelayout of the graph is generated according to a prespecified set of general rules or aestheticcriteria (such as planarity or area minimization) that are embodied in an algorithm. Perhapsthe most sophisticated graph drawing system based on the algorithmic approach is the onedeveloped by Di Battista et al.| BBL92]; which maintains a large database of graph drawingalgorithms and is able to select the one best suited to the needs of the user. The algorithmicapproach is computationally efficient; however; it does not naturally support constraints; ie;requirements that the user may want to impose on the drawing of a specific graph (eg;clustering or aligning a given set of vertices).

Interactive Visualization of Large Ontology Matching Results.,Yiting Li; Cosmin Stroe; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract. We add to the widely used AgreementMaker system the capability to visualize theresults of matching large ontologies with a user interface that supports navigation andsearch of the ontologies. The interface also supports user intervention when using afeedback loop strategy where users validate candidate mappings that have been computedautomatically by matching algorithms. The interface further displays properties of theconcepts to facilitate the decision process.,VOILA@ ISWC,2015,8
Semantic extraction of geographic data from web tables for big data integration,Isabel F Cruz; Venkat R Ganesh; Seyed Iman Mirrezaei,Abstract There are millions of web tables with geographic data that are pertinent for big dataintegration in a variety of domain applications; such as urban sustainability; transportationnetworks; policy studies; and public health. These tables; however; are heterogeneous instructure; concepts; and metadata. One of the challenges in semantically extractinggeographic data is the need to resolve these heterogeneities so as to uncover a conceptualhierarchy; metadata associated with instances; and geographic information---correspondingrespectively to ontologies; elements that we call features; and cell values that can be used toidentify geographic coordinates. In this paper; we present an architecture with methods to:(1)extract feature-rich web tables;(2) identify features;(3) construct a schema and instancesusing RDF;(4) perform geocoding. Preliminary experiments led to high accuracy in table …,Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval,2013,8
Application design and interoperability for managing personal information in the semantic desktop,Huiyong Xiao; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract. A number of semantic desktop frameworks have been proposed that addressdifferent issues in personal information management; including the organization;manipulation; and visualization of personal data. Our approach comprises a layered multi-ontology based framework; MOSE. In this paper; we describe how the architecture of MOSEsupports an application centered semantic approach to personal information management.In particular; we introduce a method based on the Model-View-Controller paradigm forpersonal information application (PIA) development; as enabled by the underlying semanticdata organization and specified by the PIA designer. We also introduce the notion ofparameterized channel and describe how it supports the interaction among multiplevisualizations in a PIA.

Quality-based model for effective and robust multi-user pay-as-you-go ontology matching 1,Isabel F Cruz; Matteo Palmonari; Francesco Loprete; Cosmin Stroe; Aynaz Taheri,Abstract Using a pay-as-you-go strategy; we allow for a community of users to validate orinvalidate mappings obtained by an automatic ontology matching system using consensusfor each mapping. The ultimate objectives are effectiveness–improving the quality of theobtained alignment (set of mappings) measured in terms of F-measure as a function of thenumber of user interactions–and robustness–making the system as much as possibleimpervious to user validation errors. Our strategy consists of two major steps: candidatemapping selection; which ranks mappings based on their perceived quality so that users arepresented first with those mappings with lowest quality; and feedback propagation; whichseeks to validate or invalidate those mappings that are perceived to be similar to themappings already presented to the users for validation. The purpose of these two …,Semantic Web,2016,7

Web rendering systems: Techniques; classification criteria and challenges,Stephen Kimani; Tiziana Catarci; Isabel Cruz,Abstract Access to information scattered all over the world is becoming increasingly commonsince the Web is the widest information repository. However; finding; organizing; andclassifying the information of interest among the massive amount of information are veryhard tasks. Other challenges include the broad user base; which mainly consists of userswith little or no background in computer science. The new goal is direct interaction with thefinal user (the person who is searching for information; and is not necessarily familiar withcomputer technology); for expressing information requests and conveying results. Directmanipulation is typically achieved in visual environments. The well-known high bandwidth ofthe human-vision channel allows both recognition and understanding of large quantities ofinformation in no more than a few seconds.,*,2003,7

The triplex approach for recognizing semantic relations from noun phrases; appositions; and adjectives,Seyed Iman Mirrezaei; Bruno Martins; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract Discovering knowledge from textual sources and subsequently expanding thecoverage of knowledge bases like DBpedia or Freebase currently requires either extensivemanual work or carefully designed information extractors. Information extractors capturetriples from textual sentences. Each triple consists of a subject; a predicate/property; and anobject. Triples can be mediated via verbs; nouns; adjectives; and appositions. We proposeTriplex; an information extractor that complements previous efforts; concentrating on noun-mediated triples related to nouns; adjectives; and appositions. Triplex automaticallyconstructs templates expressing noun-mediated triples from a bootstrapping set. Thebootstrapping set is constructed without manual intervention by creating templates thatinclude syntactic; semantic; and lexical constraints.

An interoperation framework for secure collaboration among organizations,Isabel F Cruz; Rigel Gjomemo; Greg Jarzab,Abstract In this paper we propose a framework for supporting interoperation between accesscontrol systems of different organizations in a collaborative environment. We assume thateach organization regulates access to resources using the role based access control(RBAC) model. We define the scope of collaboration as the set of shared resources; ofshared operations that those resources can execute; and of roles that can execute thoseoperations. We address collaborative scenarios in which the scope of collaboration changesbased on autonomous sharing policies of each organization. We assume that resources aremobile and that their operations can be executed only at the location in which they reside.Our framework supports queries about location of resources; of operations that thoseresources can execute; and of access rights that allow the execution of those operations …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2010,6
Data Integration for Querying Geospatial Sources.,Isabel F Cruz; Huiyong Xiao,Abstract Geospatial data management is fundamental for many applications including landuse planning and transportation and is critical in emergency management. However;geospatial data are distributed; complex; and heterogeneous due to being independentlydeveloped by various levels of government and the private sector.

Publication and customization of electronic documents using PANDA,Isabel F Cruz; Gerard T McGuire,Abstract The publication of conference proceedings and technical journals generates theneed for a consistent format or set of admissible formats; easily enforceable across thesubmissions of the authors. In this paper we present an approach for the integration ofelectronic documents; which is part of a system called PANDA. Our approach has benefitsfor editors; authors; and readers: it easily allows the editor to provide multiple user interfaceswith minimal overhead; while the authors can present their submissions using any of thepermitted different formats; and the readers can choose one of these formats or define theirown. The customization of the layout as provided by PANDA goes beyond that provided bywidely available tailorable interfaces; such as MyYahoo!. Currently our approach works onHTML files but is general enough to accommodate XML or other formats in the future.,Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Computer documentation,1999,6

A secure mediator for integrating multiple level access control policies,Isabel F Cruz; Rigel Gjomemo; Mirko Orsini,Abstract We present a method for mapping security levels among the components of adistributed system where data in the local sources are represented in XML. Distributed datais integrated using a semantic-based approach that maps each XML schema into an RDFschema and subsequently integrates those schemas into a global RDF schema using aglobal as view (GAV) approach. We transform the security levels defined on the XMLschema elements of each local source into security levels on the triples of the local RDFschemas; which form a lattice. We show how the merged data in the global schema can beclassified in different security classes belonging to the global partially ordered securitygraph.,International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems,2008,5

Ontology-based urban data exploration,Booma Sowkarthiga Balasubramani; Vivek R Shivaprabhu; Smitha Krishnamurthy; Isabel F Cruz; Tanu Malik,Abstract Cities are actively creating open data portals to enable predictive analytics of urbandata. However; the large number of observable patterns that can be extracted as rules bytechniques such as Association Rule Mining (ARM) makes the task of sifting throughpatterns a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper; we explore the use of domainontologies to:(i) filter and prune rules that are variations of a more general concept in theontology; and (ii) replace groups of rules by a single general rule with the intent ofdownsizing the number of initial rules while preserving the semantics. We show how thecombination of several methods reduces significantly the number of rules thus effectivelyallowing city administrators to use open data to generate patterns; use them for decisionmaking; and better direct limited government resources.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Smart Cities and Urban Analytics,2016,4

While AgreementMakerdid not compete in OAEI 2012; here we report on its performance in the 2012 anatomy task;using the same configurations of AgreementMaker submitted to OAEI 2011. Additionally; wealso test AgreementMaker using an updated version of the UBERON ontology as amediating ontology; and otherwise identical configurations. AgreementMaker achieved an F-measure of 91.8% with the 2011 configurations; and an F-measure of 92.2% with theupdated UBERON ontology. Thus; AgreementMaker would have been the second bestsystem had it competed in the anatomy task of OAEI 2012; and only 0.1% below the F-measure of the best system.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.1625,2012,3

Resolving schema and value heterogeneities for XML web querying,Nancy Wiegand; Naijun Zhou; Isabel F Cruz; William Sunna,Abstract To query XML data over the Web; query engines need to be able to resolvesemantic differences between heterogeneous attributes that are conceptually similar. Thisdemo presents a mapping tool and method to resolve semantic heterogeneity at the schemaand value levels for data sets that are part of a Web-based information system. The mappingtool automatically produces agreement files. We enhanced a base prototype XML Webquery system to include an ontology subsystem that generates subqueries using theagreement information. Other contributions include the use of minimal metadata to locatedata sets; a formal language construct to support query re-write called a GeoSpace; andpost-query aggregate statistics and spatial display.,Semantic Integration Workshop at the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC); Sanibel Island; Florida,2003,3
Object interoperability for geospatial applications: a case study,Isabel F Cruz; P Calnan,Abstract. In this paper; we analyze a geospatial application for visualizing US electionresults in order to show the problems that need to be solved in the mapping betweendifferent XML representations and their conceptual models. We propose a framework thatprovides a number of core classes that allow applications to treat XML documents as graphsand to evaluate XPath expressions against such document graphs. We also propose amechanism that allows information to be exchanged between document types. Our goal is toultimately attain an overall framework for interoperation where maintenance problems areminimized. To achieve this; we anticipate the need for introducing metadata in the semanticlayer that will guide the translation process between document types.,The Emerging Semantic Web,2002,3
Automatic generation of user‐defined virtual documents using query and layout templates,Isabel F Cruz; Wendy T Lucas,Abstract Delaunay MM is an authoring; querying; and visualization framework for multimediainformation retrieved from distributed repositories including the Web. Users compose virtualdocuments by specifying visually templates that contain both layout information and queryspecification. The query engine generates a set of similarly laid out pages for each template;whose number depends both on the number of retrieved objects that satisfy the queries andon the layout specification. In this paper we focus on the object-oriented data models; on thedeclarative query languages; and on the automatic generation of the virtual documents. Ourframework distinguishes itself from others in that it combines presentation with querying; inparticular by allowing for the customization of the layout by users and for the retrieval of thedistributed information using database object-oriented technology.© 1998 John Wiley & …,Theory and Practice of Object Systems,1998,3
User-De ned Visual Languages for Querying Data;",Isabel F Cruz,Abstract doodle is the rst language to be proposed for querying object-oriented databaseswith user-de ned visual languages. A doodle program de nes a visual language in a byexample fashion. In this paper we continue the preliminary expos e on doodle (SIGMOD'92).We re ne the language; and provide complex examples that illustrate the extensivecapabilities of doodle in a variety of applications. The contributions of doodle to other areasof Computer Science; such as constraint languages and graph drawing are also outlined.doodle explores the limits of declarative languages by making data and its manipulationvisual; while staying within the bounds of the formal database eld. The formal basis ofdoodle motivates the study of visual expressiveness and points to further research.,Manuscript; April,1993,3
Using the AgreementMaker to Align Ontologies for the OAEI Campaign 2009,Isabel F Cruz; Ulas C Keles; Angela Maduko; Flavio Palandri Antonelli; Cosmin Stroe,Abstract. Ontology matching; the task of finding the correspondences that exist betweenconcepts in two different ontologies; is a promising solution to the semantic heterogeneityproblem that is faced by the Semantic Web community. This paper describesAgreementMaker; a system for automatically aligning two ontologies. The AgreementMakersystem comprises an extensible architecture that allows for the integration and performancetuning of a variety of matching methods. The wide range of matching methods supportedaddresses different levels of granularity of the components being matched. AgreementMakeradopts an evaluation mechanism based on quality measures or based on the use of areference matching. It also has a multi-purpose user interface; which drives both thematching methods and the evaluation strategies. For the purpose of comparing amongst …,*,2007,2

Multimedia user interfaces,Isabel F Cruz,Work in advanced visual interfaces is facing a new challenge: the widespread use of multimediain applications; as in the World Wide Web and CD-ROMs. In such applications; visual interfacesrange from more "traditional" HTML-based Web browsers to more sophisticated visualizationtools that include animation and virtual reality. In this panel we wilt be discussing aspects relatedto the future of multimedia interfaces; as illustrated; for example; by interfaces to the World WideWeb. Web interfaces are evolving rapidly; eg; with the introduction of Java; which is becominga new standard for programming over the lnternet thus allowing for dynamic Web pages. Othernew standards are emerging; such as VRML which extends Web browsing to 3D. There are manybasic questions and techniques that have been addressed in research projects but are not yetwidely available.

Tackling the challenges of matching biomedical ontologies,Daniel Faria; Catia Pesquita; Isabela Mott; Catarina Martins; Francisco M Couto; Isabel F Cruz,Biomedical ontologies pose several challenges to ontology matching due both to thecomplexity of the biomedical domain and to the characteristics of the ontologies themselves.The biomedical tracks in the Ontology Matching Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) have spurred thedevelopment of matching systems able to tackle these challenges; and benchmarked theirgeneral performance. In this study; we dissect the strategies employed by matching systemsto tackle the challenges of matching biomedical ontologies and gauge the impact of thechallenges themselves on matching performance; using the AgreementMakerLight (AML)system as the platform for this study. We demonstrate that the linear complexity of the hash-based searching strategy implemented by most state-of-the-art ontology matching systems isessential for matching large biomedical ontologies efficiently. We show that accounting …,Journal of biomedical semantics,2018,1
Predictive Analytics Using Text Classification for Restaurant Inspections,Zhu Wang; Booma Sowkarthiga Balasubramani; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC); there are almost 48 millionpeople affected by foodborne diseases in the US every year; including 3;000 deaths. Themost effective way of avoiding food poisoning would be its prevention. However; completeprevention is not possible; therefore Public Health departments perform routine restaurantinspections; combined with the practice of inspecting specific restaurants once a diseaseoutbreak is identified. Following other health applications (eg; prediction of a flu outbreakusing Twitter); we use social media and a predictive analytics approach to identify the needfor targeted visits by city inspectors.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Smart Cities and Urban Analytics,2017,1

Location-Based Access Control Using Semantic Web Technologies,Rigel Gjomemo; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract Location-based applications are an important case within context-awareapplications. They pose interesting challenges when access control is considered for theymust satisfy requirements arising from the mobility of both users and resources. Furtherchallenges arise in collaborative environments where resources are shared by users ofdifferent organizations. In this paper we propose an access control framework based on theRole Based Access Control (RBAC) model where users and resources are abstracted assets of attributes that include their geospatial position. In our framework; collaboration isachieved through the interoperation of the access control systems of the collaboratingorganizations. We use Semantic Web languages; namely OWL and SPARQL. We argue thattheir expressive power can model a wide range of RBAC policies. In particular; reasoning …,*,2011,1

WebSA: Database support for efficient web site navigation,Isabel F Cruz; Lijun Leo Liu; Tony Y Wu,Abstract WebSA (Web Site Agent) is a web page recommendation system that helps usersnavigate efficiently within a web site. The system discovers the users' access patterns bymining the raw data from a web log file. The user interface of WebSA presents the weightedrecommendations in a separate frame of the web page. Two types of recommendations aregiven: one based on the user's access patterns and the other based on the overall pattern ofall the users of that web site. To support the visual interface and the discovery process;WebSA uses database technology to manage; query; update; and concurrently access theweb log data. The bulk of the computations for mining and updating the information are doneon a daily basis in advance.

Consequently; thesemantic web has grown with the continual creation of new ontologies and linked datacovering a wide variety of domains; and applications and analytical techniques using thisdata have been created. However; while physical data silos have waned; the lack ofsemantic links between ontologies and linked datasets; supports; in effect; invisible virtualsilos preventing these resources from being queried; browsed; or leveraged in a trulyuniform way.

Middleware forgeographic applications is particularly important because required information may havescale dependent relationships; which may cascade to cause problems related to level ofgeneralization; dimension change; and categorical precision. The challenge of supportinginteroperability is especially vexing when multiple types of data (from various sources andwith variable error characteristics) must be meaningfully integrated for use in distributedapplications. In this position paper we set out a general geographic information processingproblem as a way to motivate discussion about the use of middleware to support analyses indistributed; heterogeneous Grid computing environments.,Report of the NCGIA Specialist Meeting on Spatial Webs,2005,*

Position Statement,Nancy Wiegand; Isabel Cruz; Naijun Zhou; William Sunna,Our Computer Science and interdisciplinary backgrounds are being applied to a researchproject for a proposed Web-based statewide Wisconsin Land Information System. We areworking on semantic integration over distributed; heterogeneous spatial and nonspatial datasets to enable DBMS-type querying. Our goal of DBMS querying is an extension of theclearinghouse vision of the original working group. Our research also includes methods forlocating data sets and consideration of separate metadata files that describe data sources.We developed a tool to map theme-based ontologies to local schemas; and; in particular;included the ability to map at the value level; in addition to the attribute level. This wasnecessary because various attributes in our data sources are conceptually similar; but theirvalues are drawn from domains that differ in detail and expression.

A Framework for the Dynamic Presentation of Fused Multimedia Databases.,Isabel F Cruz; Haiyan Lin; Yuan Feng Huang,Abstract We present a multi-layered framework for the visual presentation of information thatresults from the fusion of multimedia databases. The visual presentation allows for thedynamic interaction among the views that form that presentation. By manipulating elementsin a view; the other views may change dynamically; thus allowing for interactively queryingand browsing related database objects. This dynamic interaction is established by thesemantic relationships among the objects in the multimedia databases; which originate fromthe fusion layer and percolate to the presentation layer. Data objects; visual objects; andrelationships in each layer of the framework are stored in XML format.,Multimedia Information Systems,2003,*

Delaunay MM,Isabel F Cruz; Wendy T Lucas,Abstract We introduce a visualization framework called Delaunay MM for querying andpresenting multimedia information in distributed databases. Users can tailor the layout ofvirtual documents containing multimedia information at the same time as they specify theircontents in an intuitive yet formal way; using a Web-available interface. The data model thatwe propose is object-oriented; and the query and presentation languages are declarativeand incorporate layout constraints. Our framework encompasses the retrieval ofheterogeneous distributed information whose data model does not need to conform to theone used by Delaunay MM.,Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages; VL97,1997,*
An Interchange Format for Declaratively Specified Visualizations with Constraints,Isabel F Cruz; Wendy Lucas,1 Abstract This paper defines the file structure and corresponding syntax for storing thetextual representations of visual data and queries created by users of the databaselanguage DOODLE [1]. Users of DOODLE manipulate various visual objects to createsymbolic representations of the data elements and relationships in their own object-orienteddatabases. While the data structures of the visual objects themselves have been welldefined [1]; the file structure for storing the composite pictures in textual form has yet to bespecified. This paper presents a proposed file structure along with examples demonstratingits use.,*,1996,*

Ontology Alignment for Geospatial Information Systems,Isabel F Cruz; William Sunna; Kalyan Ayloo,Abstract The problem of querying heterogeneous geospatial databases in distributedenvironment can be resolved through alignment of ontologies. That is establishingmappings between related concepts in the different ontologies without combining them.Ontology alignment facilitates the propagation of a single query written in terms of a specificontology to other databases in terms of their own ontologies. For this purpose; we haveimplemented a tool that allows database experts to semi-automatically map concepts fromone ontology to concepts in a different ontology. Our tool utilizes semi-automatic methods forpropagating such mappings along the ontologies. In this paper we present theimplementation of our tool and the principles behind our semi-automatic methods.,*,*,*

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department,Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia; Hui Ding; Peter Scheuermann; Isabel Cruz,Abstract This report presents our solution to the problem of processing continuous NearestNeighbor (NN) queries for moving objects trajectories when the exact position of a givenobject at a particular time instant is not known; but is bounded by an uncertainty region. Ashas already been observed in the literature; the answers to continuous NN-queries inspatiotemporal settings are time parameterized in the sense that the objects constituting theanswer vary over time. Incorporating uncertainty in the model yields additional attributes thataffect the semantics of the answer to this type of queries. In this report; we firstly formalize theimpact of uncertainty on the answers to the continuous probabilistic NN-queries (ie; thesemantics of the answer to such queries); and we provide a compact structure for itsrepresentation. Then; we propose efficient algorithms for constructing that structure. For …,*,*,*

Other features of theproposed language include:(1) simplicity and genericity of the basic constructs;(2) ability tospecify a variety of displays (graphs; bar charts; pie charts; etc.);(3) compatibility with theobject-oriented framework of the database language doodle. We provide the syntax and thesemantics of the language; and examples of applications that demonstrate theexpressiveness of our language.,*,*,*

Secure Personal Information Management for Mobile Devices,Isabel F Cruz,More than six decades after Vannevar Bush put forward Memex [3]; his vision of a personalinformation management (PIM) framework; most computer users are still constrained by arigid hierarchical file organization; where the semantic relationships among data are notemphasized. The semantic desktop leverages the potential of the semantic web to addressthe challenges of complex PI spaces; which are composed of syntactically and semanticallyheterogeneous data [11]. In the semantic desktop; ontologies assign meaning to data. In thisposition paper; we list security issues that arise when the semantic desktop is madeavailable in mobile devices; which may communicate with one another using the peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm [12; 19]. The need to consider PIM in mobile devices using a semanticweb approach has also been recently recognized by others [16]. In addition; we consider …,*,*,*

The semantic model is then used to interpret ambiguous languagebased on the user's real-world context.,*,*,*
Ontology Alignment for the Semantic Integration of Heterogeneous Geospatial Data Sets,Isabel F Cruz,As a growing amount of networked information is becoming available; the potential of alarge variety of applications accessing that data in a flexible and transparent way using asingle query is far reaching. Particularly important is the case where hundreds of such datasources need to be queried in geospatial; scientific; educational; and e-commerceapplications. For example; in homeland security applications; queries on a variety ofdifferent domains; eg; geospatial; biological; and governmental; should be deployed withrelatively little effort. A fundamental issue is the integration of data whose schemas displaysemantic heterogeneities. We have been working on an approach where no a prioriintegration of all the data schemas involved is needed. Instead; querying can be easilyextended to a new data source [3; 5]. Our approach has been used in real-world …,*,*,*
Context-Aware Access Control for Mobile Users,Isabel F Cruz,We consider collaborative applications of wireless mobile devices where users (possiblyfrom different organizations) are not previously identified; therefore the actions that they canperform are dynamically determined based on their own attribute values (eg; location;acceleration; movement pattern; delegated credentials) and on the attribute valuesassociated with computational (eg; data; web services) or physical (eg; hospital; armycompound) resources. In what follows; we further detail some of the research issues andapproaches. Security Model. We extend the role-based access control (RBAC) model whereroles are organized in a hierarchy. Also; in our model; users are not statically identified;therefore the actions that they can perform are determined based on the associationbetween their own attribute values and the attribute values of the resources [1].

Graph Drawing by the Magnetic Spring Model by Kozo Sugiyama and Kazuo Misue.,Isabel F Cruz; Peter Eades,The declarative approach proposed in this paper is based on a model where vertices andedges are replaced with rings and magnetic springs. Like in other spring algorithms;repulsive and attractive forces are de ned among rings. After an initial placement; the ringsare iteratively moved according to the forces; until a locally stable state is reached. Unlikeother spring algorithms; which were developed for undirected graphs only; the magneticforces introduced in this model control the orientation of the directed edges. For example; aparallel magnetic eld causes an acyclic digraph to be drawn with all the edges pointingdownward.,*,*,*
Preserving Contextual Navigation in Hypermedia Querying,Isabel F Cruz; Kimberly M James,Abstract Navigating query results is a highly volatile task; usually requiring much effort fromthe users; while not providing a firm reference point for further queries or refinement. Manyusers accessing traditional search engines are confronted with lengthy pages of hypertextlinks; through which relevant information must be found. Accessing each link can bring auser closer or farther from the information they seek; in either case; the context between thequery results and the current web page can be lost. DelaunayMM addresses these issues bycreating virtual documents through which all query results are displayed in a meaningful andorganized fashion; and that reference the originating web page; thus providing semanticbrowsing and hypermedia navigation without loss of context.,*,*,*
