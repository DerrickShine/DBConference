Mindreader: Querying databases through multiple examples,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Ravishankar Subramanya; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Users often can not easily express their queries. For example; in amultimedia/image by content setting; the user might want photographs with sunsets; incurrent systems; like QBIC; the user has to give a sample query; and to specify the relativeimportance of color; shape and texture. Even worse; the user might want correlationsbetween attributes; like; for example; in a traditional; medical record database; a medicalresearcher might want to nd\mildly overweight patients"; where the implied query wouldbe\weight/height 4 lb/inch". Our goal is to provide a user-friendly; but theoretically solidmethod; to handle such queries. We allow the user to give several examples; and;optionally; their'goodness' scores; and we propose a novel method to\guess" whichattributes are important; which correlations are important; and with what weight.

Evaluation of signature files as set access facilities in OODBs,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract Object-oriented database systems (OODBs) need efficient support for manipulationof complex objects. In particular; support of queries involving evaluations of set predicates isoften required in handling complex objects. In this paper; we propose a scheme to applysignature file techniques; which were originally invented for text retrieval; to the support ofset value accesses; and quantitatively evaluate their potential capabilities. Two signature fileorganizations; the sequential signature file and the bit-sliced signature file; are consideredand their performance is compared with that of the nested index for queries involving the setinclusion operator (⊆). We develop a detailed cost model and present analytical resultsclarifying their retrieval; storage; and update costs. Our analysis shows that the bit-slicedsignature file is a very promising set access facility in OODBs.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1993,159
Skyline queries based on user locations and preferences for making location-based recommendations,Kazuki Kodama; Yuichi Iijima; Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Due to the recent development of mobile computing and communication networktechnologies; information services for mobile phone users and car navigation systems havebecomeof some importance. Since these mobile devices have limited display sizes; we oftenneed to select carefully the appropriate information to be presented to the user. However; itis not easy to select the" appropriate" information because users have different contexts andpreferences. In this paper; we present an approach to recommending items such asrestaurants to a mobile user taking into account his current location and preferences. In ourframework; a user initially provides a profile; which records preferences as relative orderswithin predefined categories such as food types and prices. We then select items to berecommended from the database based on the user's profile as well as the current …,Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks,2009,61
Extracting Mobility Statistics from Indexed Spatio-Temporal Datasets.,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yuichi Tsukamoto; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract With the recent progress of spatial information technologies and mobile computingtechnologies; spatio-temporal databases that store information of moving objects havegained a lot of research interests. In this paper; we propose an algorithm to extract mobilitystatistics from indexed spatiotemporal datasets for interactive analysis of huge collections ofmoving object trajectories. We focus on mobility statistics called the Markov transitionprobability; which is based on a cell-based organization of a target space and the Markovchain model. The algorithm computes the specified Markov transition probabilities efficientlywith the help of an R-tree spatial index. It reduces the statistics computation task to a kind ofconstraint satisfaction problem and uses internal structure of an R-tree in an efficientmanner.,STDBM,2004,47
Spatial range querying for Gaussian-based imprecise query objects,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yuichi Iijima; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In sensor environments and moving robot applications; the position of an object is oftenknown imprecisely because of measurement error and/or movement of the object. In thispaper; we present query processing methods for spatial databases in which the position ofthe query object is imprecisely specified by a probability density function based on aGaussian distribution. We define the notion of a probabilistic range query by extending thetraditional notion of a spatial range query and present three strategies for query processing.Since the qualification probability evaluation of target objects requires numerical integrationby a method such as the Monte Carlo method; reduction of the number of candidate objectsthat should be evaluated has a large impact on query performance. We compare threestrategies and their combinations in terms of the experiments and evaluate their …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,39
A novelty-based clustering method for on-line documents,Sophoin Khy; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract In this paper; we describe a document clustering method called novelty-baseddocument clustering. This method clusters documents based on similarity and novelty. Themethod assigns higher weights to recent documents than old ones and generates clusterswith the focus on recent topics. The similarity function is derived probabilistically; extendingthe conventional cosine measure of the vector space model by incorporating a documentforgetting model to produce novelty-based clusters. The clustering procedure is a variationof the K-means method. An additional feature of our clustering method is an incrementalupdate facility; which is applied when new documents are incorporated into a documentrepository. Performance of the clustering method is examined through experiments.Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.,World Wide Web,2008,36
Efficient error-tolerant query autocompletion,Chuan Xiao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Koji Tsuda; Kunihiko Sadakane,Abstract Query autocompletion is an important feature saving users many keystrokes fromtyping the entire query. In this paper we study the problem of query autocompletion thattolerates errors in users' input using edit distance constraints. Previous approaches indexdata strings in a trie; and continuously maintain all the prefixes of data strings whose editdistance from the query are within the threshold. The major inherent problem is that thenumber of such prefixes is huge for the first few characters of the query and is exponential inthe alphabet size. This results in slow query response even if the entire query approximatelymatches only few prefixes. In this paper; we propose a novel neighborhood generation-based algorithm; IncNGTrie; which can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup overexisting methods for the error-tolerant query autocompletion problem.

An on-line document clustering method based on forgetting factors,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yibing Chen; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract With the rapid development of on-line information services; informationtechnologies for on-line information processing have been receiving much attentionrecently. Clustering plays important roles in various on-line applications such as extractionof useful information from news feeding services and selection of relevant documents fromthe incoming scientific articles in digital libraries. In on-line environments; users generallyhave interests on newer documents than older ones and have no interests on obsolete olddocuments. Based on this observation; we propose an on-line document clustering methodF 2 ICM (Forgetting-Factor-based Incremental Clustering Method) that incorporates thenotion of a forgetting factor to calculate document similarities. The idea is that everydocument gradually losses its weight (or memory) as time passes according to this factor …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2001,34
Anonymizing user location and profile information for privacy-aware mobile services,Masanori Mano; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Due to the growing use of mobile devices; location-based services have becomepopular. A location service often requires the user's exact location to provide appropriateservices and this brings the risk of threats to privacy. In this paper; we propose ananonymization method for users of location-based services in mobile environments. Theanonymization approach is based on the well-known k-anonymity concept; but hasadditional features. We consider the situation that a mobile service (eg; mobileadvertisement) utilizes mobile users' profiles for its service. Since a profile contains privacyinformation such as the age and address of the user; the use of profile information bringsanother kind of privacy threat.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks,2010,31
Pattern discovery in data streams under the time warping distance,Machiko Toyoda; Yasushi Sakurai; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Subsequence matching is a basic problem in the field of data stream mining. Inrecent years; there has been significant research effort spent on efficiently findingsubsequences similar to a query sequence. Another challenging issue in relation tosubsequence matching is how we identify common local patterns when both sequences areevolving. This problem arises in trend detection; clustering; and outlier detection. Dynamictime warping (DTW) is often used for subsequence matching and is a powerful similaritymeasure. However; the straightforward method using DTW incurs a high computation costfor this problem. In this paper; we propose a one-pass algorithm; CrossMatch; that achievesthe above goal. CrossMatch addresses two important challenges:(1) how can we identifycommon local patterns efficiently without any omission?(2) how can we find common …,The VLDB Journal,2013,30
Direction-based spatial skylines,Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yunjun Gao,Abstract Traditional location-based services recommend nearest objects to the user byconsidering their spatial proximity. However; an object not only has its distance but also hasits direction which originates from the user to it. In this paper; we study direction-basedspatial skyline queries (DSS queries) which retrieve nearest objects around the user fromdifferent directions. The closer object is better than or dominates the further object if they arein the same direction. The objects that cannot be dominated by any other object are includedin the direction-based spatial skyline (DSS). We propose algorithms to answer snapshotqueries which find objects on the DSS according to the user's current position. We alsodevelop algorithms to support continuous queries which retrieve objects on the DSS whilethe user is moving linearly.

Efficient processing of graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applicationsin bioinformatics; chemistry; social networks; pattern recognition; etc. A recent trend is totolerate noise arising from various sources such as erroneous data entries and find similaritymatches. In this paper; we study graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints.Inspired by the q-gram idea for string similarity problems; our solution extracts paths fromgraphs as features for indexing. We establish a lower bound of common features to generatecandidates. Efficient algorithms are proposed to handle three types of graph similarityqueries by exploiting both matching and mismatching features as well as degree informationto improve the filtering and verification on candidates. We demonstrate the proposedalgorithms significantly outperform existing approaches with extensive experiments on …,The VLDB Journal,2013,26
Estimation of false drops in set-valued object retrieval with signature files,Hiroyuki Kitagawa; Yoshiaki Fukushima; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract Advanced database systems have to support complex data structures as treated inobject-oriented data models and nested relational data models. In particular; efficientprocessing of set-valued object retrieval (simply; set retrieval) is indispensable for suchsystems. In the previous paper [6]; we proposed the use of signature files as efficient setretrieval facilities and showed their potential capabilities based on a disk page access costmodel. Retrieval with signature files is always accompanied by mismatches called falsedrops; and it is very important in designing signature files to properly control the false drops.In this paper; we present an in-depth study of false drops in set retrieval with signature files.We derive formulas estimating false drops in four types of set retrieval based on the “has-subset;”“is-subset;”“has-intersection;” and “is-equal” relationships.

T-scroll: Visualizing trends in a time-series of documents for interactive user exploration,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Mikine Hasegawa,Abstract On the Internet; a large number of documents such as news articles and onlinejournals are delivered everyday. We often have to review major topics and topic transitionsfrom a large time-series of documents; but it requires much time and effort to browse andanalyze the target documents. We have therefore developed an information visualizationsystem called T-Scroll (Trend/Topic-Scroll) to visualize the transition of topics extracted fromthose documents. The system takes periodical outputs of the underlying clustering systemfor a time-series of documents then visualizes the relationships between clusters as a scroll.Using its interaction facility; users can grasp the topic transitions and the details of topics forthe target time period. This paper describes the idea; the functions; the implementation; andthe evaluation of the T-Scroll system.,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2007,22
Direction-based surrounder queries for mobile recommendations,Xi Guo; Baihua Zheng; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yunjun Gao,Abstract Location-based recommendation services recommend objects to the user based onthe user's preferences. In general; the nearest objects are good choices considering theirspatial proximity to the user. However; not only the distance of an object to the user but alsotheir directional relationship are important. Motivated by these; we propose a new spatialquery; namely a direction-based surrounder (DBS) query; which retrieves the nearestobjects around the user from different directions. We define the DBS query not only in a two-dimensional Euclidean space E but also in a road network R. In the Euclidean space E; weconsider two objects a and b are directional close wrt a query point q iff the included angle∠ aqb is bounded by a threshold specified by the user at the query time. In a road networkR; we consider two objects a and b are directional close iff their shortest paths to q …,The VLDB Journal,2011,20
Effective top-k keyword search in relational databases considering query semantics,Yanwei Xu; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Jihong Guan,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases has recently emerged as a new researchtopic. As a search result is often assembled from multiple relational tables; existing IR-styleranking strategies can not be applied directly. In this paper; we propose a novel IR rankingstrategy considering query semantics for effective keyword search. The experimental resultson a large-scale real database demonstrate that our method results in significantimprovement in terms of retrieval effectiveness as compared to previous ranking strategies.,*,2009,18
Novelty-based incremental document clustering for on-line documents,Sophoin Khy; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Document clustering has been used as a core technique in managing vast amount of dataand providing needed information. In on-line environments; generally new information gainsmore interests than old one. Traditional clustering focuses on grouping similar documentsinto clusters by treating each document with equal weight. We proposed a novelty-basedincremental clustering method for on-line documents that has biases on recent documents.In the clustering method; the notion of 'novelty'is incorporated into a similarity function and aclustering method; a variant of the K-means method; is proposed. We examine the efficiencyand behaviors of the method by experiments.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006. Proceedings. 22nd International Conference on,2006,18
Continual neighborhood tracking for moving objects using adaptive distances,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa; Tooru Kawashima,Based on the recent progress of digital cartography; global positioning systems (GPSs); andhand-held devices; there are growing needs of technology that provides neighborhoodinformation to moving objects according to their locations and trajectories. In this paper wepropose spatial query generation models that take account of the current position and thepast/future trajectories of a moving object to provide appropriate neighborhood informationto it. For this purpose; we introduce an influence model of trajectory points and deriveneighborhood query generation models using adaptive ellipsoid distances. We describequery processing strategies for these query generation models and show incremental queryupdate procedures to support continual query facilities with low processing cost. Finally; wepresent experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2002. Proceedings. International,2002,18
Processing all k-nearest neighbor queries in hadoop,Takuya Yokoyama; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yu Suzuki,Abstract A k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) query; which retrieves nearest k points from adatabase is one of the fundamental query types in spatial databases. An all k-nearestneighbor query (A k NN query); a variation of ak-NN query; determines the k-nearestneighbors for each point in the dataset in a query process. In this paper; we propose amethod for processing A k NN queries in Hadoop. We decompose the given space into cellsand execute a query using the MapReduce framework in a distributed and parallel manner.Using the distribution statistics of the target data points; our method can process givenqueries efficiently.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2012,16
Finding probabilistic nearest neighbors for query objects with imprecise locations,Yuichi Iijima; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,A nearest neighbor query is an important notion in spatial databases and moving objectdatabases. In the emerging application fields of moving object technologies; such as mobilesensors and mobile robotics; the location of an object is often imprecise due to noise andestimation errors. We propose techniques for processing a nearest neighbor query when thelocation of the query object is specified by an imprecise Gaussian distribution. First; weconsider two query processing strategies for pruning candidate objects; which can reducethe number of objects that require numerical integration for computing the qualificationprobabilities. In addition; we consider a hybrid approach that combines the two strategies.The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using test data.,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009.

A number of query languages for XML documents have been proposed up to thepresent. Some of them enable tag-based powerful document structure manipulation.However; their contents processing capability is very limited. Here; the contents processingimplies the similarity-based selection; ranking; summary generation; topic extraction; and soon; as well as simple string-based pattern matching.

Monitoring aggregate k-nn objects in road networks,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract In recent years; there is an increasing need to monitor k nearest neighbor (k-NN) ina road network. There are existing solutions on either monitoring k-NN objects from a singlequery point over a road network; or computing the snapshot k-NN objects over a roadnetwork to minimize an aggregate distance function with respect to multiple query points. Inthis paper; we study a new problem that is to monitor k-NN objects over a road network frommultiple query points to minimize an aggregate distance function with respect to the multiplequery points. We call it a continuous aggregate k-NN (CANN) query. We propose a newapproach that can significantly reduce the cost of computing network distances whenmonitoring aggregate k-NN objects on road networks. We conducted extensive experimentalstudies and confirmed the efficiency of our algorithms.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,15

A dynamic mobility histogram construction method based on Markov chains,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yoji Machida; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,With the recent progress of spatial information technologies and communicationtechnologies; it has become easier to track positions of a large number of moving objects inreal-time. Mobility statistics plays an important role in the interactive analysis of a largecollection of moving objects trajectories and its use of movement pattern prediction.

A semantic caching method based on linear constraints,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Because performance is a crucial issue in database systems; data caching techniques havebeen studied in the database research field; especially in client-server databases anddistributed databases. Recently; the idea of semantic caching has been proposed. Theapproach uses semantic information to describe cached data items so that it tries to exploitnot only temporal locality but also semantic locality to improve query response time. Wepropose linear constraint-based semantic caching as a new approach to semantic caching.Based on the idea of constraint databases; we describe the semantic information about thecached relational tuples as compact constraint tuples.

Traceable P2P record exchange based on database technologies,Fengrong Li; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Information exchanges in P2P networks have become very popular in recent years.However; tracing how data circulates between peers and how data modifications areperformed during the circulation before reaching the destination are not easy because datareplications and modifications are performed independently by peers. This creates a lack ofreliability among the records exchanged. To provide reliable and flexible informationexchange facilities in P2P networks; we propose a framework for a record exchange systembased on database technologies. The system consists of three layers: a user layer; a logicallayer and a physical layer. Its tracing operations are executed as distributed recursivequeries among cooperating peers in a P2P network.

Animal models of myasthenia gravis: utility and limitations,Renato Mantegazza; Chiara Cordiglieri; Alessandra Consonni; Fulvio Baggi,Abstract Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by the immuneattack of the neuromuscular junction. Antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor(AChR) induce receptor degradation; complement cascade activation; and postsynapticmembrane destruction; resulting in functional reduction in AChR availability. Besides anti-AChR antibodies; other autoantibodies are known to play pathogenic roles in MG. Theexperimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) models have been of great help over the years inunderstanding the pathophysiological role of specific autoantibodies and T helperlymphocytes and in suggesting new therapies for prevention and modulation of the ongoingdisease.

Our wrapping target is information retrieval systems (IRSs) that provideaccess to structured documents. We describe a wrapper construction method for such IRSswith limited functionality. A constructed wrapper enhances retrieval facilities of theunderlying IRS and provides an object database view to the mediator. We focus ondetermining whether the underlying IRS can support a given query. Then we discuss someresearch issues related to our wrapping architecture.,*,1997,7

A combination dominates another combination if it is not worse than anther onein all attributes and better than another one in one attribute at least. The combinations; whichcannot be dominated by any other combinations; are optimal.

However; it is not easy for users to directly specifyECA rules and to verify them. In this paper; we propose a scheme to specify new informationdelivery services using the framework of the relational algebra. We discuss some importantproperties of the specification and show how we can derive ECA rules to implement the …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001. Proceedings.

Processing probabilistic range queries over Gaussian-based uncertain data,Tingting Dong; Chuan Xiao; Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Probabilistic range query is an important type of query in the area of uncertain datamanagement. A probabilistic range query returns all the objects within a specific range fromthe query object with a probability no less than a given threshold. In this paper we assumethat each uncertain object stored in the databases is associated with a multi-dimensionalGaussian distribution; which describes the probability distribution that the object appears inthe multi-dimensional space. A query object is either a certain object or an uncertain objectmodeled by a Gaussian distribution. We propose several filtering techniques and an R-tree-based index to efficiently support probabilistic range queries over Gaussian objects.Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,5
Query processing in a traceable P2P record exchange framework,Fengrong Li; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,As the spread of high-speed networks and the development of network technologies; P2Ptechnologies are actively used today for information exchange in the network. Whileinformation exchange in a P2P network is quite flexible; there is an important problem--lackof reliability. Since we cannot know the details of how the data was obtained; it is hard tofully rely on it. To ensure the reliability of exchanged data; we have proposed the frameworkof a traceable P2P record exchange based on database technologies. In this framework;records are exchanged among autonomous peers; and each peer stores its exchange andmodification histories in it. The framework supports the function of tracing queries to querythe details of the obtained data. A tracing query is described in datalog and executed as arecursive query in the P2P network. In this paper; we focus on the query processing …,IEICE transactions on information and systems,2010,5

Source description-based approach for the modeling of spatial information integration,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract Rapid development of information technology such as mobile terminals and GPSsystems enabled information services that provide location-oriented information based onusers' positions. In this paper; we propose an approach for the modeling of informationintegration applications that incorporate spatial information sources in addition toconventional information sources to provide appropriate location-oriented information tousers. First; we present our approach to the modeling of spatial information sources basedon the source description framework. It provides a way to represent the content and thequery capability of a spatial information source in a descriptive manner. Then we show aquery processing scheme that finds a combination of information sources to respond togiven queries and to evaluate them efficiently.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2001,5

Local similarity search for unstructured text,Pei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Xiaoyang Zhang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract With the growing popularity of electronic documents; replication can occur for manyreasons. People may copy text segments from various sources and make modifications. Inthis paper; we study the problem of local similarity search to find partially replicated text.Unlike existing studies on similarity search which find entirely duplicated documents; ourtarget is to identify documents that approximately share a pair of sliding windows which differby no more than τ tokens. Our problem is technically challenging because for slidingwindows the tokens to be indexed are less selective than entire documents; rendering setsimilarity join-based algorithms less efficient. Our proposed method is based onenumerating token combinations to obtain signatures with high selectivity. In order to strike abalance between signature and candidate generation; we partition the token universe …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4
Scalable top-k keyword search in relational databases,Yanwei Xu; Jihong Guan; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent yearsbecause it does not require users neither to master a certain structured query language norto know the complex underlying database schemas. There would be a huge number of validresults for a keyword query in a large database. However; only the top 10 or 20 mostrelevant matches for the keyword query–according to some definition of “Relevance”–aregenerally of interest. In this paper; we propose an efficient method for answering top-kkeyword queries over relational databases. The proposed method is built on an existingscheme of keyword search on relational data streams; but incorporates the rankingmechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two improvements to supporttop-k keyword search in relational databases.

Efficient continual top-k keyword search in relational databases,Yanwei Xu; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Jihong Guan,抄録 Keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent yearsbecause it requires users neither to master a certain structured query language nor to knowthe complex underlying database schemas. Most existing methods focus on answeringsnapshot keyword queries in static databases. In practice; however; databases are updatedfrequently; and users may have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with suchsituations; it is necessary to build effective and efficient facilities in a database system tosupport continual keyword queries. In this paper; we propose an efficient method foranswering continual keyword queries over relational databases. The proposed methodconsists of two core algorithms.

Privacy Preservation for Location-Based Services Based on Attribute Visibility.,Masanori Mano; Xi Guo; Tingting Dong; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,ABSTRACT To provide a high-quality mobile service in a safe way; many techniques forlocation anonymity have been proposed in recent years. Advanced location-based servicessuch as mobile advertisement services may use not only users' locations but also users'attributes. However; the existing location anonymization methods do not consider attributeinformation and may result in low-quality privacy protection. In this paper; we propose thenotion of visibility; which describes the degree that an adversary can infer the identity of theuser by an observation. Then we present an anonymization method which considers notonly location information but also users' attributes. We show several strategies for theanonymization process and evaluate them based on the experiments.,IMMoA,2012,4
An index structure for spatial range querying on Gaussian distributions,Kazuki Kodama; Tingting Dong; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,ABSTRACT In the research area of spatial databases; query processing based on uncertainlocation information has become an important research topic. In this paper; we propose anindex structure for the case that the locations of a query object and target objects areimprecise and specified by Gaussian distributions with different parameters. The indexstructure efficiently supports probabilistic spatial range queries; which is an enhancedversion of traditional spatial range queries; by considering the properties of Gaussiandistributions. We implement the proposed index structure using GiST; a generalized indexstructure; and we evaluate its performance based on the experiments.,Proc.

“Pay-as-You-Go” Processing for Tracing Queries in a P2P Record Exchange System,Fengrong Li; Takuya Iida; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract In recent years; data provenance or lineage tracing has become an acute issue inthe database research. Our target is the data provenance issue in peer-to-peer (P2P)networks where duplicates and modifications of data occur independently in autonomouspeers. To ensure reliability among the exchanged data in P2P networks; we have proposeda reliable record exchange framework with tracing facilities based on database technologiesin [5; 6]. The framework is based on the “pay-as-you-go” approach in which the systemmaintains the minimum amount of information for tracing with low maintenance cost and auser pays the cost when he or she issues a tracing query to the system. This paper focuseson its two alternative query processing strategies and compare their characteristicsaccording to the performance.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,4
Record extraction based on user feedback and document selection,Jianwei Zhang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract In recent years; the research of record extraction from large document data isbecoming popular. However there still exist some problems in record extraction. 1) whenlarge document data is used for the target of information extraction; the process usuallybecomes very expensive. 2) it is also likely that extracted records may not pertain to theuser's interest on the aspect of the topic. To address these problems; in this paper wepropose a method to efficiently extract those records whose topics agree with the user'sinterest. To improve the efficiency of the information extraction system; our method identifiesdocuments from which useful records are probably extracted. We make use of user feedbackon extraction results to find topic-related documents and records. Our experiments show thatour system achieves high extraction accuracy across different extraction targets.,*,2007,4
Processing XML view queries including user-defined foreign functions on relational databases,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Jun Kawada; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,With the increased popularity of XML; XML publishing of RDBs has been attracting a lot ofresearch interest. One of the typical approaches is to use a middleware system to renderXML views over RDBs and to allow users to access data with XML query languages such asXQuery. The query processing is done efficiently by making the best of the querying powerof RDBMSs. Namely; XML queries are translated into SQL queries and tagging operations;which are processed by the RDBMSs and middleware; respectively. In some XML querylanguages including XQuery; use of user-defined foreign functions is enabled or planned asan extension feature to cope with domain dependent semantics. Foreign functions aredefined for XML fragments; and their implementations are often given by codes in a generalprogramming language.

Frequent Subgraph Mining Based on Pregel,Xiang Zhao; Yifan Chen; Chuan Xiao; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Jiuyang Tang,Abstract Graph is an increasingly popular way to model complex data; and the size of singlegraphs is growing toward massive. Nonetheless; executing graph algorithms efficiently andat scale is surprisingly challenging. As a consequence; distributed programming frameworkshave emerged to empower large graph processing. Pregel; as a popular computationalmodel for processing billion-vertex graphs; has been employed to improve the scalability ofmany algorithms. In this paper; we investigate frequent subgraph mining on single largegraphs using Pregel. We present the first distributed algorithm based on Pregel for singlemassive graphs. In addition; two optimizations are proposed to enhance the algorithm;reducing communication cost and distribution overhead.

Dynamic mapping of dense geo-tweets and web pages based on spatio-temporal analysis,Yuanyuan Wang; Goki Yasui; Yukiko Kawai; Toyokazu Akiyama; Kazutoshi Sumiya; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Twitter evidently stirred a popular trend of personal update sharing. Twitter userscan be kept up to date with current information from Twitter; however; users cannot obtainthe most recent information; while they browse web pages since these are not updated inreal time. Meanwhile; Twitter users are difficult to gain useful information about their currentlocations since these are often posted on web pages. To solve them; it is important to enrichtraditional web pages with real time tweets. Therefore; we developed a novel tweet mappingsystem to support web and Twitter user communication through both the contents of tweetsand web pages based on spatio-temporal analysis. Our system maps geo-tagged tweets toweb pages by matching their location names; and categorizes tweets based on categorynames of floors from web pages according to different time frames. Thus; our system can …,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,3
Content-based element search for presentation slide reuse,Jie Zhang; Chuan Xiao; Toyohide Watanabe; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Presentation slide composition is an important job for knowledge workers. Instead of startingfrom scratch; users tend to make new presentation slides by reusing existing ones. A primarychallenge in slide reuse is to select desired materials from a collection of existing slides. Thestate-of-the-art solution utilizes texts and images in slides as well as file names to help usersto retrieve the materials they want. However; it only allows users to choose an entire slide asa query but does not support the search for a single element such as a few keywords; asentence; an image; or a diagram. In this paper; we investigate content-based search for avariety of elements in presentation slides. Users may freely choose a slide element as aquery.

We propose a two-step method to solve this problem efficiently. We firstretrieve frequent movement patterns of categories from the transformed database ofsequential categories; and then cluster dense trajectories in a growth-type way for allmovement patterns. Moreover; we define a new metric distance function on trajectories. Wealso use M-tree to cluster trajectories more efficiently.

Clustering Editors of Wikipedia by Editor's Biases,Akira Nakamura; Yu Suzuki; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Wikipedia is an Internet encyclopedia where any user can edit articles. Becauseeditors act on their own judgments; editors' biases are reflected in edit actions. When editors'biases are reflected in articles; the articles should have low credibility. However; it is difficultfor users to judge which parts in articles have biases. In this paper; we propose a method ofclustering editors by editors' biases for the purpose that we distinguish texts' biases by usingeditors' biases and aid users to judge the credibility of each description. If each text isdistinguished such as by colors; users can utilize it for the judgments of the text credibility.Our system makes use of the relationships between editors: agreement and disagreement.We assume that editors leave texts written by editors that they agree with; and delete textswritten by editors that they disagree with. In addition; we can consider that editors who …,Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)-Volume 01,2013,2

In our proposed framework; theprovenance/lineage of the exchanged data can be available by issuing tracing queries.Processing for tracing queries was based on the “pay-as-you-go” approach. The frameworkcan achieve low maintenance cost since each peer only maintains minimum amount ofinformation for tracing.

Efficient continuous top-k keyword search in relational databases,Yanwei Xu; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Jihong Guan,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent years.Most of the previous studies focus on how to answer an instant keyword query. In this paper;we focus on how to find the top-k answers in relational databases for continuous keywordqueries efficiently. As answering a keyword query involves a large number of join operationsbetween relations; reevaluating the keyword query when the database is updated is ratherexpensive. We propose a method to compute a range for the future relevance score of queryanswers. For each keyword query; our method computes a state of the query evaluationprocess; which only contains a small amount of data and can be used to maintain top-kanswers when the database is continually growing. The experimental results show that ourmethod can be used to solve the problem of responding to continuous keyword searches …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,2

An On-line Document Clustering Method Based on Forgetting Factors (long version),Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yibing Chen; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract. With the rapid development of on-line information services; informationtechnologies for on-line information processing have been receiving much attentionrecently. Clustering plays important roles in various on-line applications such as extractionof useful information from news feeding services and selection of relevant documents fromthe incoming scientific articles in digital libraries. In on-line environments; users generallyhave interests on newer documents than older ones and have no interests on obsolete olddocuments. Based on this observation; we propose an on-line document clustering method,*,2001,2
Design and performance analysis of indexing schemes for set retrieval of nested objects,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Efficient retrieval of nested objects is an important issue in advanced database systems. Sofar; a number of indexing methods for nested objects have been proposed. However; theydo not consider retrieval of nested objects based on the set comparison operators such as<sg00019. gif> and< sg00004. gif>. Previouly; we proposed four set access facilities fornested objects and compared their performance in terms of retrieval cost; storage cost; andupdate cost. In this paper; we extend the study and present refined algorithms and costformulas applicable to more generalized situations. Our cost models and analysis not onlycontribute to the study of set-valued retrieval but also to cost estimation of various indexingmethods for nested objects in general.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,1995,2
QUERYING GEOGRAPHIC DATA IN XML VIA EXTENSIBLE XML QUERY LANGUAGE X ¾ QL,Norihide Shinagawa; Takaaki Nagai; Hiroyuki Kitagawa; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,ABSTRACT XML has attracted a great deal of attention as standard data exchange format;and XML representing geographic information such as G-XML has been developed. In nearfuture; geographic data written in XML will be exchanged through the Internet. Therefore; itwill become a very important issue to efficiently query geographic data in XML. To querygeographic data in XML; spatial operations such as distance calculation and spatialcontainment test need be provided in query languages. However; in general; XML querylanguages do not support such spatial operations.

Extraction of Frequent Patterns Based on Users' Interests from Semantic Trajectories with Photographs,Yoshiaki Takimoto; Kento Sugiura; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Along with the popularization of location-based social networking (LBSN); semantictrajectories; which are trajectories with additional information such as photographs and texts;are increasing; and their utilization is required. We consider frequent pattern extraction asapplicable to analysis of semantic trajectories and extraction of regions of interest (ROIs). Inthis research; we propose SimDBSCAN; which considers both spatial density and similarityof points; by extending DBSCAN; which uses density-based clustering; in order to captureusers' interests. Since SimDBSCAN identifies points that are interested in the same object inthe neighborhood as ROIs; it is possible to detect not only known ROIs such as tourist sitesbut also unknown ROIs.

Top-k Pattern Matching Using an Information-Theoretic Criterion over Probabilistic Data Streams,Kento Sugiura; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract As the development of data mining technologies for sensor data streams; moresophisticated methods for complex event processing are demanded. In the case of eventrecognition; since event recognition results may contain errors; we need to deal with theuncertainty of events. We therefore consider probabilistic event data streams withoccurrence probabilities of events; and develop a pattern matching method based onregular expressions. In this paper; we first analyze the semantics of pattern matching overnon-probabilistic data streams; and then propose the problem of top-k pattern matching overprobabilistic data streams. We introduce the use of an information-theoretic criterion to selectappropriate matches as the result of pattern matching. Then; we present an efficientalgorithm to detect top-k matches; and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using …,Asia-Pacific Web (APWeb) and Web-Age Information Management (WAIM) Joint Conference on Web and Big Data,2017,1
Consistencies of fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML documents,Zongmin Ma; Luyi Bai; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Li Yan,Abstract Researches on spatiotemporal data based on XML has received increasingattention due to that XML has a lot of advantages such as extensibility and flexibility.Although XML has been employed to model and handle spatiotemporal data; relatively littlework has been carried out to further investigate the consistencies of spatiotemporal data;especially fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML documents.

A recent trend is to support the error-tolerant autocompletion;which increases the usability significantly by matching prefixes of database strings andallowing a small number of errors. In this article; we systematically study the queryprocessing problem for error-tolerant autocompletion with a given edit distance threshold.We propose a general framework that encompasses existing methods and characterizesdifferent classes of algorithms and the minimum amount of information they need to maintainunder different constraints. We then propose a novel evaluation strategy that achieves theminimum active node size by eliminating ancestor-descendant relationships among activenodes entirely.

An automatic video reinforcing system based on popularity rating of scenes and level of detail controlling,Yuanyuan Wang; Yukiko Kawai; Kazutoshi Sumiya; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,With the advance of video-on-demand (VOD) services such as Netfix; users are able towatch many kinds of videos anytime and anywhere. While watching a video; recently; usersoften search related information about it through the Web by using mobile PC. However;users cannot satisfactorily understand and enjoy it because the video keeps playing whenthey search about it. It is necessary to detect various questions of the video to supplementtheir related information about each scene for automatic search. However; only one videoincludes various topics of each scene; furthermore; viewers have different levels ofknowledge. Therefore; we have developed a novel automatic video reinforcing system;called TV-Binder; it generates new video contents from one video stream related to viewers'interests and knowledge by adding other related contents (ie; YouTube videos; images or …,Multimedia (ISM); 2015 IEEE International Symposium on,2015,1
Reverse direction-based surrounder queries,Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Aziguli Wulamu; Yonghong Xie,Abstract This paper proposes a new spatial query called the reverse direction-basedsurrounder (RDBS) query; which retrieves a user who is seeing a point of interest (POI) asone of their direction-based surrounders (DBSs). According to a user; one POI can bedominated by a second POI if the POIs are directionally close and the first POI is farther fromthe user than the second is. Two POIs are directionally close if their included angle withrespect to the user is smaller than an angular threshold; θ. If a POI cannot be dominated byanother POI; it is a DBS of the user. We also propose an extended query called thecompetitor RDBS query. POIs that share the same RDBSs with another POI are defined ascompetitors of that POI. We design algorithms to answer the RDBS queries and competitorqueries. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can answer the …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2015,1
Grouping methods for pattern matching in probabilistic data streams,Kento Sugiura; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yuya Sasaki,Abstract In recent years; complex event processing has attracted considerable interest inresearch and industry. Pattern matching is used to find complex events in data streams. Inprobabilistic data streams; however; the system may find multiple matches in a given timeinterval. This may result in inappropriate matches; because multiple matches maycorrespond to a single event. We therefore propose grouping methods of matches forprobabilistic data streams; and call such merged matches a group. We describe thedefinitions and generation methods of groups; propose an efficient approach for calculatingan occurrence probability of a group; and compare the proposed approach with a naïve oneby experiment. The results demonstrate the properties and effectiveness of the proposedmethod.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,1

Using materialized views to enhance a traceable P2P record exchange framework,Fengrong Li; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract—P2P technologies are drawing increasing attention nowadays; and have beenwidely deployed on the Internet for various purposes. Unlike the traditional client-serverarchitecture; a P2P network allows all computers to communicate and share resources asequals and does not depend on a central server for control. In such an environment; tracinghow data is copied between peers and how data modifications are performed are not easybecause data replications and modifications are performed independently by autonomouspeers. This creates inconsistencies in exchanged information and results in a lack oftrustworthiness. To provide reliable and flexible information exchange facility in P2Pnetworks; we have proposed a framework for enabling traceable record exchange.

Direction-based spatial skylines (long version),Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yunjun Gao,ABSTRACT Traditional location-based services recommend nearest objects to the user byconsidering their spatial proximity. However; an object not only has its distance but also hasits direction which originates from the user to it. In this paper; we study direction-basedspatial skyline queries (DSS queries) which retrieve nearest objects around the user fromdifferent directions. The closer object is better than or dominates the further object if they arein the same direction. The objects that cannot be dominated by any other object are includedin the direction-based spatial skyline (DSS). We propose algorithms to answer snapshotqueries which find objects on the DSS according to the user's current position. We alsodevelop algorithms to support continuous queries which retrieve objects on the DSS whilethe user is moving linearly. Extensive experiments verify the performance of our proposed …,*,2010,1
Querying topic evolution in time series document clusters,Sophoin Khy; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,抄録 A document clusteringmethod for time series documents produces a sequence ofclustering results over time. Analyzing the contents and trends in a long sequence ofclustering results is a hard and tedious task since there are too many number of clusters. Inthis paper; we propose a framework to find clusters of users' topics of interest and evolutionpatterns called transition patterns involving the topics. A cluster in a clustering result maycontinue to appear in or move to another cluster; branch into more than one cluster; mergewith other clusters to form one cluster; or disappear in the adjacent clustering result. Thisresearch aims at providing users facilities to retrieve specific transition patterns in theclustering results. For this purpose; we propose a query language for time series documentclustering results and an approach to query processing.

Feature-based distributed object search using signatures in Peer-to-Peer environments,Ryo Matsushita; Hiroyuki Kitagawa; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology has attracted a lot of attention in recent years.Efficient object search is an important research issue in P2P environments; especially inthose without centralized global indexes. Although a number of hash-based basic objectsearch schemes are known to alleviate the problem; they cannot provide flexible feature-based object searches. This paper proposes a novel object search method using distributedframe sliced signatures; and looks at an appropriate choice of parameters to adapt theconfiguration to the object search and registration workload. It shows object search andregistration schemes that take into account the number of messages and response times.Effectiveness of these schemes is evaluated through simulation experiments.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,1
Transforming XPath Queries for Bottom-Up Query Processing.,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Takaaki Nagai; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,ABSTRACT The widespreading of XML as a content-description language on the Webrequires advanced processing and management techniques for huge XML databases.XPath is a standard language for extracting the specified elements from XML documents;and its efficient support is one of the key issues in the current XML database technology. Inthis paper; we propose an XPath query transformation method for the efficient queryprocessing. It transforms top-down; navigation-based XPath queries into equivalent bottom-up query plans by using schema information. Based on this technique; we can achieveefficient set-oriented processing of XPath queries with the support of index mechanisms.,ISDB,2002,1
Integration of spatial information sources based on source description framework,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Gihyong Ryu; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Recent progress of digital cartography and Internet technologies enabled new types ofservices on the network such as search engines that provide information within somespecific geographic areas and retrieval services which allow map-oriented query interfaces.We call such services spatial information sources. In this paper; we propose a framework tointegrate heterogeneous spatial information sources to provide an integrated view to users.Our main focus is heterogeneity of spatial information sources-since existing spatialinformation sources differ in their contents and query capabilities; integration of suchsources requires an appropriate framework to describe their contents and query capabilities.In this paper; we show such a description framework and illustrate query processingstrategies that utilize source descriptions of spatial information sources.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001.

Grouping Methods for Pattern Matching over Probabilistic Data Streams,Kento Sugiura; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yuya Sasaki,As the development of sensor and machine learning technologies has progressed; it hasbecome increasingly important to detect patterns from probabilistic data streams. In thispaper; we focus on complex event processing based on pattern matching. When we applypattern matching to probabilistic data streams; numerous matches may be detected at thesame time interval because of the uncertainty of data. Although existing methods distinguishbetween such matches; they may derive inappropriate results when some of the matchescorrespond to the real-world event that has occurred during the time interval. Thus; wepropose two grouping methods for matches. Our methods output groups that indicate theoccurrence of complex events during the given time intervals.

Direction-based spatial skyline queries (データ工学),Xi Guo; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,抄録 A location-based service provides a mobile user real-time suggestions by using thespatial information such as his current position and the possible destinations. Traditionally;this service regards the user's position and his possible destinations as points in theEuclidean space and chooses closer points to the query as better destinations. In practice;however; the direction for a destination is an important factor for the user's decision.Therefore; our framework chooses better points considering not only the distance aspect butalso the direction aspect. The better points are defined in terms of an extended notion of theskyline concept; no other points can defeat them in both aspects. We propose efficientmethods to respond instantaneous and continuous direction-based spatial skyline queriesand search for better points in terms of both aspects.,電子情報通信学会技術研究報告. DE; データ工学,2009,*
Efficient incremental top-k keyword search in relational databases (データ工学),Yanwei Xu; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,抄録 Keyword search in relational databases has attracted a lot of research interests inrecent yeas. It is widely realized that supporting keyword search in relational databases willprovide a large range of high quality services. As involving a large number of join operationsbetween relations when answering a keyword query; efficiency issue is one of the mostimportant facts to consider when developing such a keyword search system; especiallywhen the database is updating frequently at the same time. In this paper; we study how toefficiently answer keyword search in relational databases in an incremental way. At the endof the query evaluation; a snapshot of the process is taken and stored. The snapshot can beused to restart the process after the database is updated.

In this paper; we propose a framework to find clusters of userinterest and change patterns called transition patterns involving the clusters. A cluster in aclustering result may persist in another cluster; branch into more than one cluster; mergewith other clusters to form one cluster; or disappear in the adjacent clustering result.

Organization and analysis of access facilities for set-valued objects based on signature files,Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Set is a fundamental data structure and plays important role in data modeling notonly for traditional database applications but for advanced ones. The main issue of thisdissertation is indexing methods for set-valued objects. Set has several inherent comparisonoperators such as inclusion () and membership (3). Therefore; indexing methods for set-valued objects must support e cient retrieval of objects under such set retrieval conditions. Inthis dissertation; superimposed-coded signature les; popular methods in text retrieval area;are proposed as promising indexing methods for set-valued objects. Such signature les arecalled set-based signature les. In this dissertation; several issues of set-based signature les;such as organization schemes; retrieval/update algorithms; and availability; are investigated.,*,1995,*

実データの分析に基づくクラスタリングパラメータ,Sophoin KHY; Yoshiharu ISHIKAWA; Hiroyuki KITAGAWA,Abstract In our previous papers; we have proposed a novelty-based document clusteringmethod. The clustering method generates clusters reflecting current trend of recent topics.However; the problem with this clustering method is the setting of the exponential decayingfactor parameter through which a document loses its value as time passes. In the clusteringmethod; the parameter value is assumed a user-specified parameter and only one value isused for all types of docu-ments regardless of which categories they are in. In this paper; wewill show an analytical study on the real dataset The objective of this study is to find therelationship between the decaying behavior of each document with their correspondingcategory types which will be helpful in the setting of parameter values in the novelty-baseddocument clustering method.,*,*,*

Visualization of Dense Tweets based on Locations for Web and Twitter User Communication,Yuanyuan Wang; Yukiko Kawai; Toyokazu Akiyama; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Kazutoshi Sumiya,ABSTRACT This paper presents a tweet visualization system to support simultaneouscommunication between web and Twitter users through both the contents of tweets and webpages based on locations. The system provides a question answering interface attached toweb pages; which allows web users to chat with Twitter users while presenting tweets thatare associated with web pages. In order to map tweets to web pages; the system matcheslocation names retrieved from geo-tagged tweets and web pages. Furthermore; we detectfloor information from tweets; and categorizes tweets based on category names of floorinformation from web pages. Thus; our system can effectively present most related tweetsand their summary information to help web users easily gain more detailed current situationin real time; and it also can effectively present messages from web users to help Twitter …,*,*,*
Efficient Autocompletion with Error tolerance,Sheng HU; Chuan XIAO; Yoshiharu ISHIKAWA,Abstract Most popular search engines have provided query autocompletion features in theirsystems. When a user issues a query; without inputting complete keywords; the searchengine will prompt several options which complete the remaining part of the queryautomatically. This research will focus on investigating novel techniques for error-tolerantquery autocompletion by addressing several key issues of this feature; and eventuallyimprove the efficiency and the accuracy of the query processing. In our work; we proposedan improve expansion algorithm based on current state-of-the-art work. Moreover; we alsoimprove the index reduction method to reduce the index size as much as possible.Experiment results show that our new method can improve the algorithm efficiency andreduce the index size very well.,*,*,*

Incremental Clustering Based on Novelty of On-line Documents-Experiments and Evaluation,Sophoin KHY; Yoshiharu ISHIKAWA; Hiroyuki KITAGAWA,Abstract Due to increased requirement of managing and extracting useful information frommyriad data; clustering has been widely used as a fundamental technique in data miningand as a preprocessing step for other algorithms such as characterization and classification.Various clustering researches have been conducted since decades ago. In our researchabout clustering; a novelty-based incremental document clustering method which takes intoconsideration novelty of documents in a similarity measure and performs clustering basedon an extended algorithm of the К-means method was proposed.

In this paper; we propose a method called LocalRank to rank web pages byintegrating the web and a user database containing information on a specific geographicalarea. LocalRank is a rank value for a web page to assess its relevance degree to databaseentries considering geographical locality and its popularity on a local web space. In ourmethod; we first construct a linked graph structure using entries contained in the database.The nodes of this graph consist of database entries and their related web pages. The edgesin the graph are composed of semantic links including geographical links between thesenodes; in addition to conventional hyperlinks. Then a link analysis is performed to compute aLocalRank value for each node. LocalRank can represent user's interest since this grapheffectively integrates the web and the user database. Our experimental results for a local …,*,*,*
