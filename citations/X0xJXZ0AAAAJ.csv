Redefining the transparency order,Kaushik Chakraborty; Sumanta Sarkar; Subhamoy Maitra; Bodhisatwa Mazumdar; Debdeep Mukhopadhyay; Emmanuel Prouff,Abstract In this paper; we consider the multi-bit Differential Power Analysis (DPA) in theHamming weight model. In this regard; we revisit the definition of Transparency Order (TOTO) from the work of Prouff (FSE 2005) and find that the definition has certain limitations.Although this work has been quite well referred in the literature; surprisingly; theselimitations remained unexplored for almost a decade. We analyse the definition from scratch;modify it and finally provide a definition with better insight that can theoretically capture DPAin Hamming weight model for hardware implementation with precharge logic. At the end; weconfront the notion of (revised) transparency order with attack simulations in order to study towhat extent the low transparency order of an s-box impacts the efficiency of a side channelattack against its processing. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first time that such a …,Designs; Codes and Cryptography,2017,24
Arbitrarily long relativistic bit commitment,Kaushik Chakraborty; André Chailloux; Anthony Leverrier,Abstract We consider the recent relativistic bit commitment protocol introduced by Lunghi etal.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115; 030502 (2015)] and present a new security analysis againstclassical attacks. In particular; while the initial complexity of the protocol scales doubleexponentially with the commitment time; our analysis shows that the correct dependence isonly linear. This has dramatic implications in terms of implementation: in particular; thecommitment time can easily be made arbitrarily long; by only requiring both parties tocommunicate classically and perform efficient classical computation.,Physical review letters,2015,17
Practical position-based quantum cryptography,Kaushik Chakraborty; Anthony Leverrier,Abstract We study a general family of quantum protocols for position verification and presenta class of attacks based on the Clifford hierarchy. These attacks outperform currentstrategies based on port-based teleportation for a large class of practical protocols. We thenintroduce the interleaved product protocol; a scheme for position verification involving onlythe preparation and measurement of single qubit states for which the best available attackshave a complexity exponential in the number of classical bits transmitted.,Physical Review A,2015,14
Differential power analysis in hamming weight model: How to choose among (extended) affine equivalent s-boxes,Sumanta Sarkar; Subhamoy Maitra; Kaushik Chakraborty,Abstract From the first principle; we concentrate on the Differential Power Analysis (DPA) inthe Hamming weight model. Based on the power related data of an (n; n) permutation S-box;we propose a spectrum (we call it Relative Power Spectrum; RPS in short) at 2^ n pointseach providing a vector containing n coordinates. Each coordinate contains the data relatedto single-bit DPA; and taking them together we provide relevant results in the domain of multi-bit DPA. For two affine equivalent (n; n) permutation S-boxes F and G; such that G (x)= F (Ax⊕ b); where A is a linear permutation (nonsingular binary matrix) and b is an n-bit vector; theRPSs of F and G are permutations of each other. However; this is not true in general when Fand G are affine or extended affine equivalent; ie; G (x)= B (F (Ax ⊕ b)) ⊕ L (x) ⊕ c; where Bis a linear permutation; L is a linear mapping; and c is an n-bit vector. In such a case; the …,International Conference in Cryptology in India,2014,4
Efficient quantum algorithms to construct arbitrary Dicke states,Kaushik Chakraborty; Byung-Soo Choi; Arpita Maitra; Subhamoy Maitra,Abstract In this paper; we study several quantum algorithms toward the efficient constructionof arbitrary arbitrary Dicke state. The proposed algorithms use proper symmetric Booleanfunctions that involve manipulation with Krawtchouk polynomials. Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm;Grover algorithm; and the parity measurement technique are stitched together to devise thecomplete algorithm. In addition to that we explore how the biased Hadamard transformationcan be utilized into our strategy; motivated by the work of Childs et al.(Quantum Inf Comput 2(3): 181–191; 2002).,Quantum information processing,2014,3

Improved quantum test for linearity of a Boolean function,Kaushik Chakraborty; Subhamoy Maitra,Abstract: Let a Boolean function be available as a black-box (oracle) and one likes to devisean algorithm to test whether it has certain property or it is $\epsilon $-far from having thatproperty. The efficiency of the algorithm is judged by the number of calls to the oracle so thatone can decide; with high probability; between these two alternatives. The best knownquantum algorithm for testing whether a function is linear or $\epsilon $-far$(0<\epsilon<\frac {1}{2}) $ from linear functions requires $ O (\epsilon^{-\frac {2}{3}}) $ manycalls [Hillery and Andersson; Physical Review A 84; 062329 (2011)]. We show that this canbe improved to $ O (\epsilon^{-\frac {1}{2}}) $ by using the Deutsch-Jozsa and the GroverAlgorithms.

CSHR: Selection of Cryptographically Suitable Hybrid Cellular Automata Rule,Kaushik Chakraborty; Dipanwita Roy Chowdhury,Abstract In this paper a new procedure has been proposed to synthesize cellular automata(CA) with hybrid rulesets which are very well suited for designing cryptographic primitives.These rulesets are analyzed with respect to nonlinearity; algebraic degree; d-monomial testetc. A new graph theoretic property has also been proposed to analyze the cryptographicstrength of cellular automata rules. The randomness of the sequences generated by therulesets has been tested by NIST test-suite. The experimental results are compared with theexisting related works and have shown to be out-performed.,International Conference on Cellular Automata,2012,2
Application of Grover’s algorithm to check non-resiliency of a Boolean function,Kaushik Chakraborty; Subhamoy Maitra,Abstract In this paper; we explore quantum algorithms to check the resiliency property of aBoolean function (in particular; when it is non-resilient). First we explain that Deutsch-Jozsaalgorithm can be immediately used for this purpose. We further analyse how the quadraticimprovement in query complexity can be obtained using Grover's technique. While the worstcase quantum query complexity to check the resiliency order is exponential in the number ofinput variables of the Boolean function; in our strategy one requires polynomially manymeasurements only. We also describe a subset of n-variable Boolean functions for which thealgorithm works in polynomially many steps; ie; we can achieve an exponential speed-upover best known classical algorithms.,Cryptography and Communications,2016,*
Attack strategies for position-based quantum cryptography based on the Clifford Hierarchy,Kaushik Chakraborty; Anthony Leverrier,The goal of position-based cryptography is for an honest party to use her spatio-temporalposition as her only credential in a cryptographic protocol. In particular; Position-Verificationaims at verifying that a certain party; called the prover; holds a given position in space-time.Such a protocol typically goes as follows: a set of verifiers will coordinate and send somechallenge to the prover; and it is expected that only someone sitting in the supposed positionof the prover can successfully pass the challenge. Such protocols have been studied in theclassical setting where the challenges are described by classical information; and it wasshown by [1] that information-theoretic security could never be obtained in the standard(Vanilla) model. More precisely; it is always possible for a coalition of adversaries toconvince the verifiers; even if none of the adversary sits in the spatio-temporal region …,QuPa (Quantum Paris),2015,*
Efficient quantum algorithm to construct arbitrary Dicke states (Full version at http://arxiv. org/abs/1209.5932),Kaushik Chakraborty; Byung-Soo Choi; Arpita Maitra; Subhamoy Maitra,Abstract In this paper; we study efficient algorithms towards the construction of any arbitraryDicke state. Our contribution is to use proper symmetric Boolean functions that involvemanipulations with Krawtchouk polynomials. Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm; Grover algorithm andthe parity measurement technique are stitched together to devise the complete algorithm.Further; motivated by the work of Childs et al (2002); we explore how one can plug thebiased Hadamard transformation in our strategy. Our work compares fairly with the results ofChilds et al (2002). Multipartite entanglement is one of the important areas in the field ofquantum information that has many applications including quantum secret sharing. In thispaper; we focus on the Dicke states [5]; which are useful building blocks in realizingmultipartite entanglement. The n-qubit weight w Dicke state;| Dn,*,*,*
