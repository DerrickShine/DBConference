A foundation for representing and querying moving objects,Ralf Hartmut Güting; Michael H Böhlen; Martin Erwig; Christian S Jensen; Nikos A Lorentzos; Markus Schneider; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Spatio-temporal databases deal with geometries changing over time. The goal ofour work is to provide a DBMS data model and query language capable of handling suchtime-dependent geometries; including those changing continuously that describe movingobjects. Two fundamental abstractions are moving point and moving region; describingobjects for which only the time-dependent position; or position and extent; respectively; areof interest. We propose to present such time-dependent geometries as attribute data typeswith suitable operations; that is; to provide an abstract data type extension to a DBMS datamodel and query language. This paper presents a design of such a system of abstract datatypes. It turns out that besides the main types of interest; moving point and moving region; arelatively large number of auxiliary data types are needed. For example; one needs a line …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2000,955
Novel approaches to the indexing of moving object trajectories.,Dieter Pfoser; Christian S Jensen; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract The domain of spatiotemporal applications is a treasure trove of new types of dataand queries. However; work in this area is guided by related research from the spatial andtemporal domains; so far; with little attention towards the true nature of spatiotemporalphenomena. In this work; the focus is on a spatiotemporal sub-domain; namely thetrajectories of moving point objects. We present new types of spatiotemporal queries; as wellas algorithms to process those. Further; we introduce two access methods this kind of data;namely the Spatio-Temporal R-tree (STR-tree) and the Trajectory-Bundle tree (TB-tree). Theformer is an R-tree based access method that considers the trajectory identity in the index aswell; while the latter is a hybrid structure; which preserves trajectories as well as allows for R-tree typical range search in the data. We present performance studies that compare the …,VLDB,2000,941

Capturing the uncertainty of moving-object representations,Dieter Pfoser; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Spatiotemporal applications; such as fleet management and air traffic control;involving continuously moving objects are increasingly at the focus of research efforts. Therepresentation of the continuously changing positions of the objects is fundamentallyimportant in these applications. This paper reports on on-going research in therepresentation of the positions of moving-point objects. More speciffically; object positionsare sampled using the Global Positioning System; and interpolation is applied to determinepositions in-between the samples. Special attention is given in the representation to thequantification of the position uncertainty introduced by the sampling technique and theinterpolation. In addition; the paper considers the use for query processing of the proposedrepresentation in conjunction with indexing. It is demonstrated how queries involving …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1999,635
Efficient retrieval of the top-k most relevant spatial web objects,Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Dingming Wu,Abstract The conventional Internet is acquiring a geo-spatial dimension. Web documents arebeing geo-tagged; and geo-referenced objects such as points of interest are beingassociated with descriptive text documents. The resulting fusion of geo-location anddocuments enables a new kind of top-k query that takes into account both location proximityand text relevancy. To our knowledge; only naive techniques exist that are capable ofcomputing a general web information retrieval query while also taking location into account.This paper proposes a new indexing framework for location-aware top-k text retrieval. Theframework leverages the inverted file for text retrieval and the R-tree for spatial proximityquerying. Several indexing approaches are explored within the framework. The frameworkencompasses algorithms that utilize the proposed indexes for computing the top-k query …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,502

Query and update efficient B+-tree based indexing of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract A number of emerging applications of data management technology involve themonitoring and querying of large quantities of continuous variables; eg; the positions ofmobile service users; termed moving objects. In such applications; large quantities of statesamples obtained via sensors are streamed to a database. Indexes for moving objects mustsupport queries efficiently; but must also support frequent updates. Indexes based onminimum bounding regions (MBRs) such as the R-tree exhibit high concurrency overheadsduring node splitting; and each individual update is known to be quite costly. This motivatesthe design of a solution that enables the B+-tree to manage moving objects. We representmoving-object locations as vectors that are timestamped based on their update time. Byapplying a novel linearization technique to these values; it is possible to index the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,404
Discovery of convoys in trajectory databases,Hoyoung Jeung; Man Lung Yiu; Xiaofang Zhou; Christian S Jensen; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract As mobile devices with positioning capabilities continue to proliferate; datamanagement for so-called trajectory databases that capture the historical movements ofpopulations of moving objects becomes important. This paper considers the querying ofsuch databases for convoys; a convoy being a group of objects that have traveled togetherfor some time. More specifically; this paper formalizes the concept of a convoy query usingdensity-based notions; in order to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoydiscovery is relevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and carpoolingof vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on trajectories in the literature;none of this can be applied to retrieve correctly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this;we develop three efficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known filter …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,382
Spacetwist: Managing the trade-offs among location privacy; query performance; and query accuracy in mobile services,Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen; Xuegang Huang; Hua Lu,In a mobile service scenario; users query a server for nearby points of interest but they maynot want to disclose their locations to the service. Intuitively; location privacy may beobtained at the cost of query performance and query accuracy. The challenge addressed ishow to obtain the best possible performance; subjected to given requirements for locationprivacy and query accuracy. Existing privacy solutions that use spatial cloaking employcomplex server query processing techniques and entail the transmission of large quantitiesof intermediate result. Solutions that use transformation-based matching generally fall shortin offering practical query accuracy guarantees. Our proposed framework; calledSpaceTwist; rectifies these shortcomings for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries. Starting witha location different from the user's actual location; nearest neighbors are retrieved …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,380

A foundation for capturing and querying complex multidimensional data,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems considerably improve data analysisand are finding wide-spread use. OLAP systems typically employ multidimensional datamodels to structure their data. This paper identifies 11 modeling requirements formultidimensional data models. These requirements are derived from an assessment ofcomplex data found in real-world applications. A survey of 14 multidimensional data modelsreveals shortcomings in meeting some of the requirements. Existing models do not supportmany-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions; lack built-in mechanisms forhandling change and time; lack support for imprecision; and are generally unable to insertdata with varying granularities. This paper defines an extended multidimensional datamodel and algebraic query language that address all 11 requirements. The model reuses …,Information Systems,2001,340
Multidimensional data modeling for complex data,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems considerably ease the process of analyzingbusiness data and have become widely used in industry. Such systems primarily employmultidimensional data models to structure their data. However current multidimensional datamodels fall short in their abilities to model the complex data found in some real worldapplication domains. The paper presents nine requirements to multidimensional datamodels; each of which is exemplified by a real world; clinical case study. A survey of theexisting models reveals that the requirements not currently met include support for many-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions; built-in support for handling chance andtime; and support for uncertainty as well as different levels of granularity in the data.

Collective spatial keyword querying,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging; spatial web objects thatpossess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence;and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining inprominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individualobjects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in agroup collectively satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatial webobjects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that objects arenearest to the query location and have the lowest inter-object distances. Specifically; westudy two variants of this problem; both of which are NP-complete.

Mining significant semantic locations from GPS data,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the increasing deployment and use of GPS-enabled devices; massiveamounts of GPS data are becoming available. We propose a general framework for themining of semantically meaningful; significant locations; eg; shopping malls and restaurants;from such data. We present techniques capable of extracting semantic locations from GPSdata. We capture the relationships between locations and between locations and users witha graph. Significance is then assigned to locations using random walks over the graph thatpropagates significance among the locations. In doing so; mutual reinforcement betweenlocation significance and user authority is exploited for determining significance; as areaspects such as the number of visits to a location; the durations of the visits; and thedistances users travel to reach locations.

Nearest neighbor and reverse nearest neighbor queries for moving objects,Rimantas Benetis; Christian S Jensen; Gytis Karciauskas; Simonas Saltenis,With the proliferation of wireless communications and the rapid advances in technologies fortracking the positions of continuously moving objects; algorithms for efficiently answeringqueries about large numbers of moving objects increasingly are needed. One such query isthe reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query that returns the objects that have a query objectas their closest object. While algorithms have been proposed that compute RNN queries fornon-moving objects; there have been no proposals for answering RNN queries forcontinuously moving objects. Another such query is the nearest neighbor (NN) query; whichhas been studied extensively and in many contexts. Like the RNN query; the NN query hasnot been explored for moving query and data points. This paper proposes an algorithm foranswering RNN queries for continuously moving points in the plane. As a part of the …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2002. Proceedings.

Indexing of moving objects for location-based services,Simonas Saltenis; Christian S Jensen,Visionaries predict that the Internet will soon extend to billions of wireless devices; orobjects; a substantial fraction of which will offer their changing positions to location-basedservices. This paper assumes an Internet-service scenario where objects that have notreported their position within a specified duration of time are expected to no longer beinterested in; or of interest to; the service. Due to the possibility of many" expiring" objects; ahighly dynamic database results. The paper presents an R-tree based technique for theindexing of the current positions of such objects.

Multidimensional database technology,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Multidimensional database technology is a key factor in the interactive analysis of largeamounts of data for decision making purposes. In contrast to previous technologies; thesedatabases view data as multidimensional cubes that are particularly well suited for dataanalysis. Multidimensional models categorize data either as facts with associated numericalmeasures or as textual dimensions that characterize the facts. Queries aggregate measurevalues over a range of dimension values to provide results such as total sales per month of agiven product. Multidimensional database technology is being applied to distributed dataand to new types of data that current technology often cannot adequately analyze. Forexample; classic techniques such as preaggregation cannot ensure fast query responsetimes when data-such as that obtained from sensors or GPS-equipped moving objects …,Computer,2001,267
Temporal Entity-Relationship models-a survey,Heidi Gregersen; Christian S Jensen,The entity-relationship (ER) model; using varying notations and with some semanticvariations; is enjoying a remarkable and increasing popularity in both the researchcommunity-the computer science curriculum-and in industry. In step with the increasingdiffusion of relational platforms; ER modeling is growing in popularity. It has been widelyrecognized that temporal aspects of database schemas are prevalent and difficult to modelusing the ER model. As a result; how to enable the ER model to properly capture time-varying information has; for a decade and a half; been an active area in the databaseresearch community. This has led to the proposal of close to a dozen temporally enhancedER models. This paper surveys all temporally enhanced ER models known to the authors.

-Supporting Frequent Updates in R-Trees: A Bottom-Up Approach,Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Christian S Jensen; Bin Cui; Keng Lik Teo,This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy ismotivated by the class of monitoring applications; which are characterized by large volumesof updates; and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easilybe applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques; as it preservesthe index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves therobustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging fromlocal to global—during updates; thus using expensive top-down updates only whennecessary. This chapter presents a compact main-memory summary structure along withefficient bottom-up algorithms that reduce the numbers of disk accesses and CPU resourcesused for update and querying. Empirical studies indicate that the new strategy …,*,2003,237
On the semantics of “now” in databases,James Clifford; Curtis Dyreson; Tomás Isakowitz; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract Although “now” is expressed in SQL and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP within queries;this value cannot be stored in the database. How ever; this notion of an ever-increasingcurrent-time value has been reflected in some temporal data models by inclusion ofdatabase-resident variables; such as “now”“until-changed;”“**;”“@;” and “-”. Time variablesare very desirable; but their used also leads to a new type of database; consisting of tupleswith variables; termed a variable database.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1997,237
Techniques for efficient road-network-based tracking of moving objects,Alminas Civilis; Christian S Jensen; Stardas Pakalnis,With the continued advances in wireless communications; geo-positioning; and consumerelectronics; an infrastructure is emerging that enables location-based services that rely onthe tracking of the continuously changing positions of entire populations of service users;termed moving objects. This scenario is characterized by large volumes of updates; forwhich reason location update technologies become important. A setting is assumed in whicha central database stores a representation of each moving object's current position. Thisposition is to be maintained so that it deviates from the user's real position by at most a giventhreshold. To do so; each moving object stores locally the central representation of itsposition. Then; an object updates the database whenever the deviation between its actualposition (as obtained from a GPS device) and the database position exceeds the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,227

Retrieving top-k prestige-based relevant spatial web objects,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The location-aware keyword query returns ranked objects that are near a querylocation and that have textual descriptions that match query keywords. This query occursinherently in many types of mobile and traditional web services and applications; eg; YellowPages and Maps services. Previous work considers the potential results of such a query asbeing independent when ranking them. However; a relevant result object with nearbyobjects that are also relevant to the query is likely to be preferable over a relevant objectwithout relevant nearby objects. The paper proposes the concept of prestige-basedrelevance to capture both the textual relevance of an object to a query and the effects ofnearby objects. Based on this; a new type of query; the Location-aware top-k Prestige-basedText retrieval (LkPT) query; is proposed that retrieves the top-k spatial web objects ranked …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,214
Skyline queries against mobile lightweight devices in MANETs,Zhiyong Huang; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Skyline queries are well suited when retrieving data according to multiple criteria.

We present techniques that aim to reduce the costs of communication amongmobile devices and reduce the execution time on each single mobile device. For the former;skyline query requests are forwarded among mobile devices in a deliberate way; such thatthe amount of data to be transferred is reduced.

Because advances in disk capacitiescontinue to outperform Moore's Law; it becomes increasingly feasible to store online all theposition information obtained from the moving e-service users. With the much sloweradvances in I/O speeds and many concurrent users; indexing techniques are of the essencein this scenario. Existing indexing techniques come in two forms. Some techniques capturethe position of an object up until the time of the most recent position sample; while othertechniques represent an object's position as a constant or linear function of time and capturethe position from the current time and into the (near) future.

Spatial keyword query processing: an experimental evaluation,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Dingming Wu,Abstract Geo-textual indices play an important role in spatial keyword querying. The existinggeo-textual indices have not been compared systematically under the same experimentalframework. This makes it difficult to determine which indexing technique best supportsspecific functionality. We provide an all-around survey of 12 state-of-the-art geo-textualindices. We propose a benchmark that enables the comparison of the spatial keyword queryperformance. We also report on the findings obtained when applying the benchmark to theindices; thus uncovering new insights that may guide index selection as well as furtherresearch.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,179

Pad: privacy-area aware; dummy-based location privacy in mobile services,Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract Location privacy in mobile services has the potential to become a serious concernfor service providers and users. Existing privacy protection techniques that use k-anonymityconvert an original query into an anonymous query that contains the locations of multipleusers. Such techniques; however; generally fail in offering guaranteed large privacy regionsat reasonable query processing costs. In this paper; we propose the PAD approach that iscapable of offering privacy-region guarantees. To achieve this; PAD uses so-called dummylocations that are deliberately generated according to either a virtual grid or circle. Thesecover a user's actual location; and their spatial extents are controlled by the generationalgorithms. The PAD approach only requires a lightweight server-side front-end in order for itto be integrated into an existing client/server mobile service system.

Semantics of time-varying information,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive study of the underlyingsemantics of temporal databases; summarizing the results of an intensive collaborationbetween the two authors over the last five years. We first examine how facts may beassociated with time; most prominently with one or more dimensions of valid time andtransaction time. One common case is that of a bitemporal relation; in which facts areassociated with timestamps from exactly one valid-time and one transaction-time dimension.These two times may be related in various ways; yielding temporal specialization. Multipletransaction times arise when a fact is stored in one database; then later replicated ortransferred to another database. By retaining the transaction times; termed temporalgeneralization; the original relation can be effectively queried by referencing only the final …,*,1996,165
Unifying temporal data models via a conceptual model,Christian S Jensen; Michael D Soo; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract To add time support to the relational model; both first normal form (1NF) and non-1NF data models have been proposed. Each has associated advantages anddisadvantages. For example; remaining within 1NF when time support is added mayintroduce data redundancy. On the other hand; well-established storage organization andquery evaluation techniques require atomic attribute values; and are thus intended for 1NFmodels; utilizing a non-1NF model may degrade performance. This paper describes a newtemporal data model designed with the single purpose of capturing the time-dependentsemantics of data. Here; tuples of bitemporal relations are stamped with sets of two-dimensional chronons in transaction-time/valid-time space. We use the notion of snapshotequivalence to map temporal relation instances and temporal operators of one existing …,Information systems,1994,155

Indexing of network constrained moving objects,Dieter Pfoser; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the proliferation of mobile computing; the ability to index efficiently themovements of mobile objects becomes important. Objects are typically seen as moving intwo-dimensional (x; y) space; which means that their movements across time may beembedded in the three-dimensional (x; y; t) space. Further; the movements are typicallyrepresented as trajectories; sequences of connected line segments. In certain cases;movement is restricted; and specifically in this paper; we aim at exploiting that movementsoccur in transportation networks to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Continuous clustering of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,This paper considers the problem of efficiently maintaining a clustering of a dynamic set ofdata points that move continuously in two-dimensional Euclidean space. This problem hasreceived little attention and introduces new challenges to clustering. The paper proposes anew scheme that is capable of incrementally clustering moving objects. This proposalemploys a notion of object dissimilarity that considers object movement across a period oftime; and it employs clustering features that can be maintained efficiently in incrementalfashion. In the proposed scheme; a quality measure for incremental clusters is used foridentifying clusters that are not compact enough after certain insertions and deletions. Anextensive experimental study shows that the new scheme performs significantly faster thantraditional ones that frequently rebuild clusters. The study also shows that the new …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,134
Location-related privacy in geo-social networks,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Dario Freni; Claudio Bettini; Christian S Jensen,Geo-social networks (GeoSNs) provide context-aware services that help associate locationwith users and content. The proliferation of GeoSNs indicates that they're rapidly attractingusers. GeoSNs currently offer different types of services; including photo sharing; friendtracking; and" check-ins." However; this ability to reveal users' locations causes new privacythreats; which in turn call for new privacy-protection methods. The authors study four privacyaspects central to these social networks-location; absence; co-location; and identity privacy-and describe possible means of protecting privacy in these circumstances.,IEEE Internet Computing,2011,132
Spatial keyword querying,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Qiang Qu; Anders Skovsgaard; Dingming Wu; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract The web is increasingly being used by mobile users. In addition; it is increasinglybecoming possible to accurately geo-position mobile users and web content. Thisdevelopment gives prominence to spatial web data management. Specifically; a spatialkeyword query takes a user location and user-supplied keywords as arguments and returnsweb objects that are spatially and textually relevant to these arguments. This paper reviewsrecent results by the authors that aim to achieve spatial keyword querying functionality that iseasy to use; relevant to users; and can be supported efficiently. The paper covers differentkinds of functionality as well as the ideas underlying their definition.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,130
Google fusion tables: data management; integration and collaboration in the cloud,Hector Gonzalez; Alon Halevy; Christian S Jensen; Anno Langen; Jayant Madhavan; Rebecca Shapley; Warren Shen,Abstract Google Fusion Tables is a cloud-based service for data management andintegration. Fusion Tables enables users to upload tabular data files (spreadsheets; CSV;KML); currently of up to 100MB. The system provides several ways of visualizing the data(eg; charts; maps; and timelines) and the ability to filter and aggregate the data. It supportsthe integration of data from multiple sources by performing joins across tables that maybelong to different users. Users can keep the data private; share it with a select set ofcollaborators; or make it public and thus crawlable by search engines. The discussionfeature of Fusion Tables allows collaborators to conduct detailed discussions of the data atthe level of tables and individual rows; columns; and cells. This paper describes the innerworkings of Fusion Tables; including the storage of data in the system and the tight …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM symposium on Cloud computing,2010,129
The islands approach to nearest neighbor querying in spatial networks,Xuegang Huang; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Much research has recently been devoted to the data management foundations oflocation-based mobile services. In one important scenario; the service users are constrainedto a transportation network. As a result; query processing in spatial road networks is ofinterest. We propose a versatile approach to k nearest neighbor computation in spatialnetworks; termed the Islands approach. By offering flexible yet simple means of balancing re-computation and pre-computation; this approach is able to manage the trade-off betweenquery and update performance. The result is a single; efficient; and versatile approach to knearest neighbor computation that obviates the need for using several k nearest neighborapproaches for supporting a single service scenario. The experimental comparison with theexisting techniques uses real-world road network data and considers both I/O and CPU …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,122
Spatio-temporal models and languages: An approach based on data types,Ralf Hartmut Güting; Michael H Böhlen; Martin Erwig; Christian S Jensen; Nikos Lorentzos; Enrico Nardelli; Markus Schneider; Jose RR Viqueira,Abstract In this chapter we develop DBMS data models and query languages to deal withgeometries changing over time. In contrast to most of the earlier work on this subject; thesemodels and languages are capable of handling continuously changing geometries; ormoving objects. We focus on two basic abstractions called moving point and moving region.A moving point can represent an entity for which only the position in space is relevant. Amoving region captures moving as well as growing or shrinking regions. Examples formoving points are people; polar bears; cars; trains; or air planes; examples for movingregions are hurricanes; forest fires; or oil spills in the sea.,*,2003,122
Efficient continuously moving top-k spatial keyword query processing,Dingming Wu; Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen; Gao Cong,Web users and content are increasingly being geo-positioned. This development givesprominence to spatial keyword queries; which involve both the locations and textualdescriptions of content. We study the efficient processing of continuously moving top-kspatial keyword (MkSK) queries over spatial keyword data. State-of-the-art solutions formoving queries employ safe zones that guarantee the validity of reported results as long asthe user remains within a zone. However; existing safe zone methods focus solely on spatiallocations and ignore text relevancy. We propose two algorithms for computing safe zonesthat guarantee correct results at any time and that aim to optimize the computation on theserver as well as the communication between the server and the client. We exploit tight andconservative approximations of safe zones and aggressive computational space pruning …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,120
Path prediction and predictive range querying in road network databases,Hoyoung Jeung; Man Lung Yiu; Xiaofang Zhou; Christian S Jensen,Abstract In automotive applications; movement-path prediction enables the delivery ofpredictive and relevant services to drivers; eg; reporting traffic conditions and gas stationsalong the route ahead. Path prediction also enables better results of predictive rangequeries and reduces the location update frequency in vehicle tracking while preservingaccuracy. Existing moving-object location prediction techniques in spatial-network settingslargely target short-term prediction that does not extend beyond the next road junction. To gobeyond short-term prediction; we formulate a network mobility model that offers a conciserepresentation of mobility statistics extracted from massive collections of historical objecttrajectories. The model aims to capture the turning patterns at junctions and the travelspeeds on road segments at the level of individual objects. Based on the mobility model …,The VLDB Journal,2010,120
Incremental implementation model for relational databases with transaction time,Christian S Jensen; Leo Mark; Nick Roussopoulos,An implementation model for the standard relational data model extended with transactiontime is presented. The implementation model integrates techniques of view materialization;differential computation; and deferred update into a coherent whole. It is capable of storingany view (reflecting past or present states) and subsequently using stored views as outsetsfor incremental and decremental computations of requested views; making it more flexiblethan previously proposed partitioned storage models. The working and the expressivenessof the model are demonstrated by sample queries that show how historical data areretrieved.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1991,119
Efficient tracking of moving objects with precision guarantees,Alminas Civilis; Christian S Jensen; Jovita Nenortaite; Stardas Pakalnis,Sustained advances in wireless communications; geo-positioning; and consumerelectronics pave the way to a kind of location-based service that relies on the tracking of thecontinuously changing positions of an entire population of service users. This type of serviceis characterized by large volumes of updates; giving prominence to techniques for locationrepresentation and update. This paper presents several representations; along withassociated update techniques; that predict the present and future positions of movingobjects. An update occurs when the deviation between the predicted and the actual positionof an object exceeds a given threshold. For the case where the road network; in which anobject is moving; is known; we propose a so-called segment-based policy that predicts anobject's movement according to the road's shape.

Point-versus interval-based temporal data models,Michael H Bohlen; Renato Busatto; Christian S Jensen,The association of timestamps with various data items such as tuples or attribute values isfundamental to the management of time varying information. Using intervals in timestamps;as do most data models; leaves a data model with a variety of choices for giving a meaningto timestamps. Specifically; some such data models claim to be point based while other datamodels claim to be interval based. The meaning chosen for timestamps is important it has apervasive effect on most aspects of a data model; including database design; a variety ofquery language properties; and query processing techniques; eg; the availability of queryoptimization opportunities. The paper precisely defines the notions of point based andinterval based temporal data models; thus providing a new formal basis for characterizingtemporal data models and obtaining new insights into the properties of their query …,Data Engineering; 1998.

Adding valid time to SQL/temporal,Richard T Snodgrass; Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Andreas Steiner,This change proposal introduces additions to SQL/Temporal to add valid-time support toSQL3. We outline a four-level approach for the integration of time. We motivate and discusseach level in turn; and we define the syntactic extensions that correspond to each level. Wewill see that the extensions are fairly minimal. Each level is described via a quick tourconsisting of a set of examples. These examples have been tested in a prototype which ispublicly available [14]. The proposed language constructs ensure temporal upwardcompatibility; sequenced valid semantics; and non-sequenced semantics; importantproperties that will be discussed in detail in Section 5.,ANSI X3H2-96-501r2; ISO/IEC JTC,1996,114
Extending practical pre-aggregation in on-line analytical processing,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) based on a dimensional view of data isbeing used increasingly in traditional business applications as well as in applications suchas health care for the purpose of analyzing very large amounts of data. Pre-aggregation; theprior materialization of aggregate queries for later use; is an essential technique for ensuringadequate response time during data analysis. Full pre-aggregation; where all combinationsof aggregates are materialized; is infeasible. Instead; modern OLAP systems adopt thepractical pre-aggregation approach of materializing only select combinations of aggregatesand then re-use these for efficiently computing other aggregates. However; this re-use ofaggregates is contingent on the dimension hierarchies and the relationships between factsand dimensions satisfying stringent constraints. This severely limits the scope of the …,*,1999,112
Routing questions to the right users in online communities,Yanhong Zhou; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen; Junjie Yao,Online forums contain huge amounts of valuable user-generated content. In current forumsystems; users have to passively wait for other users to visit the forum systems andread/answer their questions. The user experience for question answering suffers from thisarrangement. In this paper; we address the problem of" pushing" the right questions to theright persons; the objective being to obtain quick; high-quality answers; thus improving usersatisfaction. We propose a framework for the efficient and effective routing of a givenquestion to the top-k potential experts (users) in a forum; by utilizing both the content andstructures of the forum system. First; we compute the expertise of users according to thecontent of the forum system—-this is to estimate the probability of a user being an expert fora given question based on the previous question answering of the user.

Effective density queries on continuouslymoving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Rui Zhang,This paper assumes a setting where a population of objects move continuously in theEuclidean plane. The position of each object; modeled as a linear function from time topoints; is assumed known. In this setting; the paper studies the querying for dense regions.In particular; the paper defines a particular type of density query with desirable propertiesand then proceeds to propose an algorithm for the efficient computation of density queries.While the algorithm may exploit any existing index for the current and near-future positionsof moving objects; the Bx-tree is used.

Extending existing dependency theory to temporal databases,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass; Michael D Soo,Normal forms play a central role in the design of relational databases. Several normal formsfor temporal relational databases have been proposed. These definitions are particular tospecific temporal data models; which are numerous and incompatible. The paper attempts torectify this situation. We define a consistent framework of temporal equivalents of theimportant conventional database design concepts: functional dependencies; primary keys;and third and Boyce-Codd normal forms. This framework is enabled by making a cleardistinction between the logical concept of a temporal relation and its physical representation.As a result; the role played by temporal normal forms during temporal database designclosely parallels that of normal forms during conventional database design. These newnormal forms apply equally well to all temporal data models that have timeslice operators …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,109
Research issues in clinical data warehousing,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Medical informatics has been an important area for the application of computing anddatabase technology for at least four decades. This area may benefit from the functionalityoffered by data warehousing. However; the special nature of clinical applications posesdifferent and new requirements to data warehousing technologies; over those posed byconventional data warehouse applications. This article presents a number of exciting newresearch challenges posed by clinical applications; to be met by the database researchcommunity. These include the need for complex data modeling features; advanced temporalsupport; advanced classification structures; continuously valued data; dimensionallyreduced data; and the integration of very complex data. In addition; the support for clinicaltreatment protocols and medical research are interesting areas for research.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1998. Proceedings.

Computational data modeling for network-constrained moving objects,Laurynas Speičvcys; Christian S Jensen; Augustas Kligys,Abstract Advances in wireless communications; positioning technology; and other hardwaretechnologies combine to enable a range of applications that use a mobile user's geo-spatialdata to deliver online; location-enhanced services; often referred to as location-basedservices. Assuming that the service users are constrained to a transportation network; thispaper develops data structures that model road networks; the mobile users; and stationaryobjects of interest. The proposed framework encompasses two supplementary road networkrepresentations; namely a two-dimensional representation and a graph representation.These capture aspects of the problem domain that are required in order to support thequerying that underlies the envisioned location-based services.,Proceedings of the 11th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2003,106
Efficient evaluation of the valid-time natural join,Michael D Soo; Richard T Snodgrass; Christian S Jensen,Joins are arguably the most important relational operators. Poor implementations aretantamount to computing the Cartesian product of the input relations. In a temporaldatabase; the problem is more acute for two reasons. First; conventional techniques aredesigned for the optimization of joins with equality predicates; rather than the inequalitypredicates prevalent in valid-time queries. Second; the presence of temporally-varying datadramatically increases the size of the database. These factors require new techniques toefficiently evaluate valid-time joins. The authors address this need for efficient joinevaluation in databases supporting valid-time. A new temporal-join algorithm based on tuplepartitioning is introduced. This algorithm avoids the quadratic cost of nested-loop evaluationmethods; it also avoids sorting. Performance comparisons between the partition-based …,Data Engineering; 1994.

Indeterminacy and Spatiotemporal Data: basic definitions and case study,Dieter Pfoser; Nectaria Tryfona; Christian S Jensen,Abstract For some spatiotemporal applications; it can be assumed that the modeled world isprecise and bounded; and that also our record of it is precise. While these simplifyingassumptions are sufficient in applications like a land information system; they areunnecessarily crude for many other applications that manage data with spatial and/ortemporal extents; such as navigational applications. This work explores fuzziness anduncertainty; subsumed under the term indeterminacy; in the spatiotemporal context. Tobetter illustrate the basic spatiotemporal concepts of change or evolution; it is shown howthe fundamental modeling concepts of spatial objects; attributes; and relationships and timepoints and periods are influenced by indeterminacy and how they can be combined. Inparticular; the focus is on the change of spatial objects and their geometries across time …,GeoInformatica,2005,105
Enabling search services on outsourced private spatial data,Man Lung Yiu; Gabriel Ghinita; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Cloud computing services enable organizations and individuals to outsource themanagement of their data to a service provider in order to save on hardware investmentsand reduce maintenance costs. Only authorized users are allowed to access the data.Nobody else; including the service provider; should be able to view the data. For instance; areal-estate company that owns a large database of properties wants to allow its payingcustomers to query for houses according to location. On the other hand; the untrustedservice provider should not be able to learn the property locations and; eg; selling theinformation to a competitor. To tackle the problem; we propose to transform the locationdatasets before uploading them to the service provider.

Temporal specialization and generalization,Christian S.  Jensen; Richard Snodgrass,A standard relation has two dimensions: attributes and tuples. A temporal relation containstwo additional orthogonal time dimensions: valid time records when facts are true in themodeled reality; and transaction time records when facts are stored in the temporal relation.Although there are no restrictions between the valid time and transaction time associatedwith each fact; in many practical applications the valid and transaction times exhibitrestricted interrelationships that define several types of specialized temporal relations. Thispaper examines areas where different specialized temporal relations are present.

CQA archives contain very largevolumes of valuable user-generated content and have become important informationresources on the Web. To make the body of knowledge accumulated in CQA archivesaccessible; effective and efficient question search is required. Question search in a CQAarchive aims to retrieve historical questions that are relevant to new questions posed byusers. This paper proposes a category-based framework for search in CQA archives.

Efficient indexing of the historical; present; and future positions of moving objects,Dan Lin; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Although significant effort has been put into the development of efficient spatio-temporal indexing techniques for moving objects; little attention has been given to thedevelopment of techniques that efficiently support queries about the past; present; and futurepositions of objects. The provisioning of such techniques is challenging; both because of thenature of the data; which reflects continuous movement; and because of the types of queriesto be supported. This paper proposes the BB x-index structure; which indexes the positionsof moving objects; given as linear functions of time; at any time. The index stores linearizedmoving-object locations in a forest of B+-trees. The index supports queries that selectobjects based on temporal and spatial constraints; such as queries that retrieve all objectswhose positions fall within a spatial range during a set of time intervals.

Initially; important requirements to atdiscussed. The proposal then describes the language additions necessary emporal systemthat may facilitate such a transition are motivated and to add valid-time support to SQL3while fulfilling these requirements. The constructs of the language are divided into fourlevels; with each level adding increased temporal functionality to its predecessor.

Temporal statement modifiers,Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract A wide range of database applications manage time-varying data. Many temporalquery languages have been proposed; each one the result of many carefully made yetsubtly interacting design decisions. In this article we advocate a different approach toarticulating a set of requirements; or desiderata; that directly imply the syntactic structure andcore semantics of a temporal extension of an (arbitrary) nontemporal query language. Thesedesiderata facilitate transitioning applications from a nontemporal query language and datamodel; which has received only scant attention thus far. The paper then introduces thenotion of statement modifiers that provide a means of systematically adding temporalsupport to an existing query language. Statement modifiers apply to all query languagestatements; for example; queries; cursor definitions; integrity constraints; assertions; views …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2000,90
A generalized framework of exploring category information for question retrieval in community question answer archives,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular type of servicewhere users ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer pairs. CQAarchives contain very large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchy of categories.As an essential function of CQA services; question retrieval in a CQA archive aims to retrievehistorical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. In this paper; wepresent a new approach to exploiting category information of questions for improving theperformance of question retrieval; and we apply the approach to existing question retrievalmodels; including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model.

Preserving location and absence privacy in geo-social networks,Dario Freni; Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Sergio Mascetti; Claudio Bettini; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Online social networks often involve very large numbers of users who share verylarge volumes of content. This content is increasingly being tagged with geo-spatial andtemporal coordinates that may then be used in services. For example; a service may retrievephotos taken in a certain region. The resulting geo-aware social networks (GeoSNs) poseprivacy threats beyond those found in location-based services. Content published in aGeoSN is often associated with references to multiple users; without the publisher beingaware of the privacy preferences of those users. Moreover; this content is often accessible tomultiple users. This renders it difficult for GeoSN users to control which information aboutthem is available and to whom it is available. This paper addresses two privacy threats thatoccur in GeoSNs: location privacy and absence privacy. The former concerns the …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,86
A framework for efficient spatial web object retrieval,Dingming Wu; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The conventional Internet is acquiring a geospatial dimension. Web documents arebeing geo-tagged and geo-referenced objects such as points of interest are beingassociated with descriptive text documents. The resulting fusion of geo-location anddocuments enables new kinds of queries that take into account both location proximity andtext relevancy. This paper proposes a new indexing framework for top-k spatial text retrieval.The framework leverages the inverted file for text retrieval and the R-tree for spatial proximityquerying. Several indexing approaches are explored within this framework. The frameworkencompasses algorithms that utilize the proposed indexes for computing location-aware aswell as region-aware top-k text retrieval queries; thus taking into account both text relevancyand spatial proximity to prune the search space.

A benchmark for evaluating moving object indexes,Su Chen; Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin,Abstract Progress in science and engineering relies on the ability to measure; reliably and indetail; pertinent properties of artifacts under design. Progress in the area of database-indexdesign thus relies on empirical studies based on prototype implementations of indexes. Thispaper proposes a benchmark that targets techniques for the indexing of the current and near-future positions of moving objects. This benchmark enables the comparison of existing andfuture indexing techniques. It covers important aspects of such indexes that have notpreviously been covered by any benchmark. Notable aspects covered include updateefficiency; query efficiency; concurrency control; and storage requirements.

Requirements and research issues in geographic data modeling,Anders Friis-Christensen; Nectaria Tryfona; Christian S Jensen,Abstract It is well-documented in the literature that geographic data have specialcharacteristics that make the use of extensions to standard modeling languages andtechniques; such as the Unified Modeling Language; attractive. Based on a real-worldapplication from the Danish National Survey and Cadastre; this paper presentsrequirements to geographic data modeling notations. Existing notations are then evaluatedagainst the requirements; and a case study is carried out.

Probabilistic threshold k nearest neighbor queries over moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Bin Yang; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The availability of indoor positioning renders it possible to deploy location-basedservices in indoor spaces. Many such services will benefit from the efficient support for knearest neighbor (kNN) queries over large populations of indoor moving objects. However;existing kNN techniques fall short in indoor spaces because these differ from Euclidean andspatial network spaces and because of the limited capabilities of indoor positioningtechnologies. To contend with indoor settings; we propose the new concept of minimalindoor walking distance (MIWD) along with algorithms and data structures for distancecomputing and storage; and we differentiate the states of indoor moving objects based on apositioning device deployment graph; utilize these states in effective object indexingstructures; and capture the uncertainty of object locations. On these foundations; we study …,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on extending database technology,2010,83
R-tree based indexing of now-relative bitemporal data,Rasa Bliujute; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Saltenis; Giedrius Slivinskas,Abstract The databases of a wide range of applications; eg; in data warehousing; storemultiple states of time-evolving data. These databases contain a substantial part of now-relative data: data that became valid at some past time and remains valid until the currenttime. More specifically; two temporal aspects of data are frequently of interest; namely validtime; when data is true; and transaction time; when data is current in the database. The latteraspect is essential in all applications where accountability or trace-ability are required.When both aspects are captured; data is termed bitemporal. A number of indices have beendevised for the efficient support of operations on time-varying data with one time dimension;but only little work; based mostly on R-trees; has addressed the indexing of two-or higher-dimensional temporal data.

Joint top-k spatial keyword query processing,Dingming Wu; Man Lung Yiu; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Web users and content are increasingly being geopositioned; and increased focus is beinggiven to serving local content in response to web queries. This development calls for spatialkeyword queries that take into account both the locations and textual descriptions of content.We study the efficient; joint processing of multiple top-k spatial keyword queries. Such jointprocessing is attractive during high query loads and also occurs when multiple queries areused to obfuscate a user's true query. We propose a novel algorithm and index structure forthe joint processing of top-k spatial keyword queries. Empirical studies show that theproposed solution is efficient on real data sets.

In theresearch community as well as in industry; it is common knowledge that the temporalaspects of the mini-world are pervasive and important; but are also difficult to capture usingthe ER model. Not surprisingly; several enhancements to the ER model have beenproposed in an attempt to more naturally and elegantly support the modeling of temporalaspects of information. Common to the existing temporally extended ER models; few or nospecific requirements to the models were given by their designers. With the existingproposals; an ontological foundation; and novel requirements as its basis; this paper …,*,1998,78
Querying the trajectories of on-line mobile objects,Dieter Pfoser; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Position data is expected to play a central role in a wide range of mobile computingapplications; including advertising; leisure; safety; security; tourist; and traffic applications.Applications such as these are characterized by large quantities of wirelessly Internet-worked; position-aware mobile objects that receive services where the objects' position isessential. The movement of an object is captured via sampling; resulting in a trajectoryconsisting of a sequence of connected line segments for each moving object. This paperpresents a technique for querying these trajectories. The technique uses indices for theprocessing of spatiotemporal range queries on trajectories. If object movement isconstrained by the presence of infrastructure; eg; lakes; park areas; etc.; the technique iscapable of exploiting this to reduce the range query; the purpose being to obtain better …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2001,75

Supporting imprecision in multidimensional databases using granularities,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Online analytical processing (OLAP) technologies are being used widely; but the lack ofeffective means of handling data imprecision; which occurs when exact values are notknown precisely or are entirely missing; represents a major obstacle in applying thesetechnologies in many domains. The paper develops techniques for handling imprecisionthat aim to maximally reuse existing OLAP modeling constructs such as dimensionhierarchies and granularities. With imprecise data available in the database; queries aretested to determine whether or not they may be answered precisely given the available data;if not; alternative queries unaffected by the imprecision are suggested. When processingqueries affected by imprecision; techniques are proposed that take into account theimprecision in the grouping of the data; in the subsequent aggregate computation; and in …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1999.

Effectively indexing uncertain moving objects for predictive queries,Meihui Zhang; Su Chen; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Moving object indexing and query processing is a well studied research topic; withapplications in areas such as intelligent transport systems and location-based services.While much existing work explicitly or implicitly assumes a deterministic object movementmodel; real-world objects often move in more complex and stochastic ways. This paperinvestigates the possibility of a marriage between moving-object indexing and probabilisticobject modeling. Given the distributions of the current locations and velocities of movingobjects; we devise an efficient inference method for the prediction of future locations. Wedemonstrate that such prediction can be seamlessly integrated into existing index structuresdesigned for moving objects; thus improving the meaningfulness of range and nearestneighbor query results in highly dynamic and uncertain environments.

Indexing the trajectories of moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,Abstract Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. With appropriateindoor positioning; eg; Bluetooth and RFID; in place; large amounts of trajectory data resultthat may serve as a foundation for a wide variety of applications; eg; space planning; wayfinding; and security. This scenario calls for the indexing of indoor trajectories. Based on anappropriate notion of indoor trajectory and definitions of pertinent types of queries; the paperproposes two R-tree based structures for indexing object trajectories in symbolic indoorspace. The RTR-tree represents a trajectory as a set of line segments in a space spanned bypositioning readers and time. The TP 2 R-tree applies a data transformation that yields arepresentation of trajectories as points with extension along the time dimension.

Hybrid indoor positioning with wi-fi and bluetooth: Architecture and performance,Artur Baniukevic; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu,Reliable indoor positioning is an important foundation for emerging indoor location basedservices. Most existing indoor positioning proposals rely on a single wireless technology; eg;Wi-Fi; Bluetooth; or RFID. A hybrid positioning system combines such technologies andachieves better positioning accuracy by exploiting the different capabilities of the differenttechnologies. In a hybrid system based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; the former works as the maininfrastructure to enable fingerprint based positioning; while the latter (via hotspot devices)partitions the indoor space as well as a large Wi-Fi radio map. As a result; the Wi-Fi basedonline position estimation is improved in a divide-and-conquer manner. We study threeaspects of such a hybrid indoor positioning system. First; to avoid large positioning errorscaused by similar reference positions that are hard to distinguish; we design a …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,67

Users wish to share location data through an(untrusted) service provider such that trusted friends can perform spatial queries on the data.We solve the problem by transforming the location data before uploading them. Wecontribute spatial transformations that re-distribute locations in space and a transformationthat employs cryptographic techniques. The data owner selects transformation keys andshares them with the trusted friends. Without the keys; it is infeasible for an attacker toreconstruct the exact original data points from the transformed points.

In-route skyline querying for location-based services,Xuegang Huang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the emergence of an infrastructure for location-aware mobile services; theprocessing of advanced; location-based queries that are expected to underlie such servicesis gaining in relevance. While much work has assumed that users move in Euclidean space;this paper assumes that movement is constrained to a road network and that points ofinterest can be reached via the network. More specifically; the paper assumes that thequeries are issued by users moving along routes towards destinations. The paper defines in-route nearest-neighbor skyline queries in this setting and considers their efficientcomputation. The queries take into account several spatial preferences; and they intuitivelyreturn a set of most interesting results for each result returned by the corresponding non-skyline queries.

Transaction timestamping in (temporal) databases,Christian Jensen; David Lomet,Abstract Many database applications need accountability and trace-ability that necessitateretaining previous database states. For a transaction-time database supporting this; thechoice of times used to timestamp database records; to establish when records are or werecurrent; needs to be consistent with a committed transaction serialization order. Previoussolutions have chosen timestamps at commit time; selecting a time that agrees with commitorder. However; SQL standard databases can require an earlier choice because a statementwithin a transaction may request “current time.” Managing timestamps chosen before aserialization order is established is the challenging problem we solve here. By building ontwo-phase locking concurrency control; we can delay a transaction's choice of a timestamp;reducing the chance that transactions may need to be aborted in order keep timestamps …,*,2001,65
Outsourced similarity search on metric data assets,Man Lung Yiu; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis,This paper considers a cloud computing setting in which similarity querying of metric data isoutsourced to a service provider. The data is to be revealed only to trusted users; not to theservice provider or anyone else. Users query the server for the most similar data objects to aquery example. Outsourcing offers the data owner scalability and a low-initial investment.The need for privacy may be due to the data being sensitive (eg; in medicine); valuable (eg;in astronomy); or otherwise confidential. Given this setting; the paper presents techniquesthat transform the data prior to supplying it to the service provider for similarity queries on thetransformed data. Our techniques provide interesting trade-offs between query cost andaccuracy. They are then further extended to offer an intuitive privacy guarantee. Empiricalstudies with real data demonstrate that the techniques are capable of offering privacy …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,64
Similarity-based prediction of travel times for vehicles traveling on known routes,Dalia Tiesyte; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The use of centralized; real-time position tracking is proliferating in the areas oflogistics and public transportation. Real-time positions can be used to provide up-to-dateinformation to a variety of users; and they can also be accumulated for uses in subsequentdata analyses. In particular; historical data in combination with real-time data may be used topredict the future travel times of vehicles more accurately; thus improving the experience ofthe users who rely on such information. We propose a Nearest-Neighbor Trajectory (NNT)technique that identifies the historical trajectory that is the most similar to the current; partialtrajectory of a vehicle. The historical trajectory is then used for predicting the futuremovement of the vehicle. The paper's specific contributions are two-fold. First; we definedistance measures and a notion of nearest neighbor that are specific to trajectories of …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,64
Adaptable query optimization and evaluation in temporal middleware,*,Time-referenced data are pervasive in most real-world databases. Recent advances intemporal query languages show that such database applications may benefit substantiallyfrom built-in temporal support in the DBMS. To achieve this; temporal query optimization andevaluation mechanisms must be provided; either within the DBMS proper or as a sourcelevel translation from temporal queries to conventional SQL. This invention proposes a newapproach: using a middleware component on top of a conventional DBMS. This componentaccepts temporal SQL statements and produces a corresponding query plan consisting ofalgebraic as well as regular SQL parts. The algebraic parts are processed by themiddleware; while the SQL parts are processed by the DBMS. The middleware usesperformance feedback from the DBMS to adapt its partitioning of subsequent queries into …,*,2004,64
Capturing and querying multiple aspects of semistructured data,Curtis E Dyreson; Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Motivated to a large extent by the substantial and growing prominence of the World-Wide Web and the potential benefits that may be obtained by applying database conceptsand techniques to web data management; new data models and query languages haveemerged that contend with the semistructured nature of web data. These models organizedata in graphs. The nodes in a graph denote objects or values; and each edge is labeledwith a single word or phrase. Nodes are described by the labels of the paths that lead tothem; and these descriptions serve as the basis for querying. This paper proposes anextensible framework for capturing and querying properties in a semistructured data model.The paper considers temporal properties of data; prices associated with data access; qualityratings associated with the data; and access restrictions on the data.

Adding transaction time to sql/temporal,Richard T Snodgrass; Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Andreas Steiner,Transaction time identifies when data was asserted in the database. If transaction time issupported; the states of the database at all previous points of time are retained and updatesare append-only. Unlike valid time; transaction time cannot be entirely simulated with tableswith explicit timestamp columns. The reason is that tables with transaction-time support areappend-only: they grow monotonically. While the query functionality can be simulated ontable with no temporal support; in the same way that valid-time query functionality can betranslated into queries on table with no temporal support; there is no way to restrict the userto modifications that ensure the table is appendonly. While one can revoke permission touse DELETE; it is still possible for the user to corrupt the transaction timestamp via databaseupdates and insertions. This means that the user can never be sure that what the table …,ISO-ANSI SQL/Temporal Change Proposal; ANSI X3H2-96-152r ISO/IEC JTC1/SC21/WG3 DBL,1996,64
Effective timestamping in databases,Kristian Torp; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract Many existing database applications place various timestamps on their data;rendering temporal values such as dates and times prevalent in database tables. During thepast two decades; several dozen temporal data models have appeared; all with timestampsbeing integral components. The models have used timestamps for encoding two specifictemporal aspects of database facts; namely transaction time; when the facts are current inthe database; and valid time; when the facts are true in the modeled reality. However; withfew exceptions; the assignment of timestamp values has been considered only in the contextof individual modification statements. This paper takes the next logical step: It considers theuse of timestamping for capturing transaction and valid time in the context of transactions.The paper initially identifies and analyzes several problems with straightforward …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2000,62

Notions of upward compatibility of temporal query languages,John Bair; Michael H.  Boehlen; Christian S.  Jensen; Richard T.  Snodgrass,Abstract Migrating applications from conventional to temporal database managementtechnology has received scant mention in the research literature. This paper formally definesthree increasingly restrictive notions of upward compatibility which capture properties of atemporal SQL with respect to conventional SQL that; when satisfied; provide for a smoothmigration of legacy applications to a temporal system. The notions of upward compatibilitydictate the semantics of conventional SQL statements and constrain the semantics ofextensions to these statements. The paper evaluates the seven extant temporal extensionsto SQL; all of which are shown to complicate migration through design decisions that violateone or more of these notions. We then outline how SQL–92 can be systematically extendedto become a temporal query language that satisfies all three notions.,Wirtschaftsinformatik,1997,61

Travel cost inference from sparse; spatio temporally correlated time series using Markov models,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The monitoring of a system can yield a set of measurements that can be modeledas a collection of time series. These time series are often sparse; due to missingmeasurements; and spatiotemporally correlated; meaning that spatially close time seriesexhibit temporal correlation. The analysis of such time series offers insight into theunderlying system and enables prediction of system behavior. While the techniquespresented in the paper apply more generally; we consider the case of transportation systemsand aim to predict travel cost from GPS tracking data from probe vehicles. Specifically; eachroad segment has an associated travel-cost time series; which is derived from GPS data. Weuse spatio-temporal hidden Markov models (STHMM) to model correlations among differenttraffic time series.

The availability of easy-to-use and low-cost indoor positioning servicesis essential in also enabling indoor LBSs. Existing indoor positioning services typically use asingle technology such as Wi-Fi; RFID or Bluetooth. Wi-Fi based indoor positioning isrelatively easy to deploy; but does often not offer good positioning accuracy. In contrast; theuse of RFID or Bluetooth for positioning requires considerable investments in equipment inorder to ensure good positioning accuracy. Motivated by these observations; we propose ahybrid approach to indoor positioning.

Main-memory operation buffering for efficient R-tree update,Laurynas Biveinis; Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Emerging communication and sensor technologies enable new applications ofdatabase technology that require database systems to efficiently support very high rates ofspatial-index updates. Previous works in this area require the availability of large amounts ofmain memory; do not exploit all the main memory that is indeed available; or do not supportsome of the standard index operations. Assuming a setting where the index updates neednot be written to disk immediately; we propose an R-tree-based indexing technique thatdoes not exhibit any of these drawbacks. This technique exploits the buffering of updateoperations in main memory as well as the grouping of operations to reduce disk I/O. Inparticular; operations are performed in bulk so that multiple operations are able to share I/O.The paper presents an analytical cost model that is shown to be accurate by empirical …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,54
Hyper-local; directions-based ranking of places,Petros Venetis; Hector Gonzalez; Christian S Jensen; Alon Halevy,Abstract Studies find that at least 20% of web queries have local intent; and the fraction ofqueries with local intent that originate from mobile properties may be twice as high. Theemergence of standardized support for location providers in web browsers; as well as ofproviders of accurate locations; enables so-called hyper-local web querying where thelocation of a user is accurate at a much finer granularity than with IP-based positioning. Thispaper addresses the problem of determining the importance of points of interest; or places;in local-search results. In doing so; the paper proposes techniques that exploit loggeddirections queries. A query that asks for directions from a location a to a location b is taken tosuggest that a user is interested in traveling to b and thus is a vote that location b isinteresting. Such user-generated directions queries are particularly interesting because …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,53
Indoor-A New Data Management Frontier.,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,Abstract Much research has been conducted on the management of outdoor moving objects.In contrast; relatively little research has been conducted on indoor moving objects. Theindoor setting differs from outdoor settings in important ways; including the following two.First; indoor spaces exhibit complex topologies. They are composed of entities that areunique to indoor settings; eg; rooms and hallways that are connected by doors. As a result;conventional Euclidean distance and spatial network distance are inapplicable in indoorspaces. Second; accurate; GPS-like positioning is typically unavailable in indoor spaces.Rather; positioning is achieved through the use of technologies such as Bluetooth; Infrared;RFID; or Wi-Fi. This typically results in much less reliable and accurate positioning. Thispaper covers some preliminary research that explicitly targets an indoor setting …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2010,53
Spatio-temporal database support for legacy applications,Michael Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Bjørn Skjellaug,ABSTRACT In areas such as finance; marketing; and property and resource management;many database applications manage spatio-temporal data. These applications typically runon top of a relational DBMS and manage spatio-temporal data either using the DBMS; whichprovides little support; or employ the services of a proprietary system that co-exists with theDBMS; but is separate from and not integrated with the DBMS. This wealth of applicationsmay benefit substantially from built-in; integrated spatio-temporal DBMS support. Providing afoundation for such support is an important and substantial challenge. This paper initiallydefines technical requirements to a spatio-temporal DBMS aimed at protecting businessinvestments in the existing legacy applications and at reusing personnel expertise.

The tsql2 data model,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass; Michael D Soo,Abstract Adding time to the relational model has been a daunting task [Bolour et al. 1982;McKenzie 1986; Soo 1991; Stam & Snodgrass 1988]. More than two dozen time-extendedrelational data models have been proposed over the last fifteen years [Snodgrass 1992].Most of these are valid-time models. Each fact in a valid-time relation has associated thetime when it is true in the modeled reality. Other models support transaction-time relationswhere each fact has associated the time when it is current in the database. A few supportboth valid and transaction time [Ben-Zvi 1982; Bhargava & Gadia 1989A; Snodgrass 1987;Snodgrass et al. 1993; Thompson 1991]; such models are termed bitemporal. As a whole;these data models are referred to as temporal data models [Jensen et al. 1994].,*,1995,53

Parallel main-memory indexing for moving-object query and update workloads,Darius Šidlauskas; Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract We are witnessing a proliferation of Internet-worked; geo-positioned mobile devicessuch as smartphones and personal navigation devices. Likewise; location-related servicesthat target the users of such devices are proliferating. Consequently; server-sideinfrastructures are needed that are capable of supporting the location-related query andupdate workloads generated by very large populations of such moving objects. This paperpresents a main-memory indexing technique that aims to support such workloads. Thetechnique; called PGrid; uses a grid structure that is capable of exploiting the parallelismoffered by modern processors. Unlike earlier proposals that maintain separate structures forupdates and queries; PGrid allows both long-running queries and rapid updates to operateon a single data structure and thus offers up-to-date query results.

Stochastic skyline route planning under time-varying uncertainty,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Manohar Kaul; Shuo Shang,Different uses of a road network call for the consideration of different travel costs: in routeplanning; travel time and distance are typically considered; and green house gas (GHG)emissions are increasingly being considered. Further; travel costs such as travel time andGHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses; we proposetechniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost; time-dependent; uncertain graph(MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the roadnetwork. Based on the MTUG; we define stochastic skyline routes that consider multiplecosts and time-dependent uncertainty; and we propose efficient algorithms to retrievestochastic skyline routes for a given source-destination pair and a start time.

Ecomark: evaluating models of vehicular environmental impact,Chenjuan Guo; Yu Ma; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen; Manohar Kaul,Abstract The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation is essentialfor achieving politically agreed upon emissions reduction targets that aim to combat globalclimate change. So-called eco-routing and eco-driving are able to substantially reduce GHGemissions caused by vehicular transportation. To enable these; it is necessary to be able toreliably quantify the emissions of vehicles as they travel in a spatial network. Thus; a numberof models have been proposed that aim to quantify the emissions of a vehicle based on GPSdata from the vehicle and a 3D model of the spatial network the vehicle travels in. Wedevelop an evaluation framework; called EcoMark; for such environmental impact models. Inaddition; we survey all eleven state-of-the-art impact models known to us.

Location privacy techniques in client-server architectures,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract A typical location-based service returns nearby points of interest in response to auser location. As such services are becoming increasingly available and popular; locationprivacy emerges as an important issue. In a system that does not offer location privacy; usersmust disclose their exact locations in order to receive the desired services. We view locationprivacy as an enabling technology that may lead to increased use of location-basedservices. In this chapter; we consider location privacy techniques that work in traditionalclient-server architectures without any trusted components other than the client's mobiledevice. Such techniques have important advantages. First; they are relatively easy toimplement because they do not rely on any trusted third-party components. Second; theyhave potential for wide application; as the client-server architecture remains dominant for …,*,2009,45
Extending OLAP querying to external object databases,Torben Bach Pedersen; Arie Shoshani; Junmin Gu; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems based on a multidimensionalview of data have found widespread use in business applications and are being usedincreasingly in non-standard applications. These systems provide good performance andease-of-use. However; the complex structures and relationships inherent in data in non-standard applications are not accommodated well by OLAP systems. In contrast; objectdatabase systems are built to handle such complexity; but do not support OLAP-typequerying well. This paper presents the concepts and techniques underlying a flexible;“multi-model” federated system that enables OLAP users to exploit simultaneously the features ofOLAP and object database systems. The system allows data to be handled using the mostappropriate data model and technology: OLAP systems for multidimensional data and …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,45
Using abstractions for spatio-temporal conceptual modeling,Nectaria Tryfona; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT Conceptual data modeling for complex applications; such as multimedia andspatiotemporal applications; often results in large; complicated and difficult-to-comprehenddiagrams. These diagrams frequently involve repetition of autonomous; semanticallymeaningful parts that capture similar situations and characteristics. By recognizing suchparts and treating them as modeling units; it is possible to simplify the diagrams; as well asthe conceptual modeling process. In this paper; based on requirements drawn from realapplications; we present a set of modeling units that capture spatial; temporal; andspatiotemporal aspects. To facilitate the conceptual design process; these units areabbreviated in the conceptual diagrams by corresponding spatial; temporal; andspatiotemporal modeling abstractions. The result is more elegant and less-detailed …,Proceedings of the 2000 ACM symposium on Applied computing-Volume 1,2000,45
Effective caching of shortest paths for location-based services,Jeppe Rishede Thomsen; Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Web search is ubiquitous in our daily lives. Caching has been extensively used toreduce the computation time of the search engine and reduce the network traffic beyond aproxy server. Another form of web search; known as online shortest path search; is populardue to advances in geo-positioning. However; existing caching techniques are ineffective forshortest path queries. This is due to several crucial differences between web search resultsand shortest path results; in relation to query matching; cache item overlapping; and querycost variation. Motivated by this; we identify several properties that are essential to thesuccess of effective caching for shortest path search. Our cache exploits the optimal subpathproperty; which allows a cached shortest path to answer any query with source and targetnodes on the path. We utilize statistics from query logs to estimate the benefit of caching a …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,44
A foundation for efficient indoor distance-aware query processing,Hua Lu; Xin Cao; Christian S Jensen,Indoor spaces accommodate large numbers of spatial objects; eg; points of interest (POIs);and moving populations. A variety of services; eg; location-based services and securitycontrol; are relevant to indoor spaces. Such services can be improved substantially if theyare capable of utilizing indoor distances. However; existing indoor space models do notaccount well for indoor distances. To address this shortcoming; we propose a datamanagement infrastructure that captures indoor distance and facilitates distance-awarequery processing. In particular; we propose a distance-aware indoor space model thatintegrates indoor distance seamlessly. To enable the use of the model as a foundation forquery processing; we develop accompanying; efficient algorithms that compute indoordistances for different indoor entities like doors as well as locations. We also propose an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,44
Scalable continuous range monitoring of moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Bin Yang; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. The continuousrange monitoring of such objects can be used as a foundation for a wide variety ofapplications; eg; space planning; way finding; and security. Indoor space differs fromoutdoor space in that symbolic locations; eg; rooms; rather than Euclidean positions orspatial network locations are important. In addition; positioning based on presence sensingdevices; rather than; eg; GPS; is assumed. Such devices report the objects in their activationranges. We propose an incremental; query-aware continuous range query processingtechnique for objects moving in this setting. A set of critical devices is determined for eachquery; and only the observations from those devices are used to continuously maintain thequery result. Due to the limitations of the positioning devices; queries contain certain and …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,44

Multi-dimensional aggregation for temporal data,Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Business Intelligence solutions; encompassing technologies such as multi-dimensional data modeling and aggregate query processing; are being applied increasinglyto non-traditional data. This paper extends multi-dimensional aggregation to apply to datawith associated interval values that capture when the data hold. In temporal databases;intervals typically capture the states of reality that the data apply to; or capture when the dataare; or were; part of the current database state. This paper proposes a new aggregationoperator that addresses several challenges posed by interval data. First; the intervals to beassociated with the result tuples may not be known in advance; but depend on the actualdata. Such unknown intervals are accommodated by allowing result groups that arespecified only partially. Second; the operator contends with the case where an interval …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,44
Conceptual models for spatio-temporal applications,Nectaria Tryfona; Rosanne Price; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Improved support for modeling information systems involving time-varying;georeferenced information; termed spatio-temporal information; has been a longterm userrequirement in a variety of areas; such as cadastral systems that capture the histories oflandparcels; routing systems computing possible routes of vehicles; and weather forecastingsystems. This chapter concerns the conceptual database design phase for such spatio-temporal information systems and presents two models; namely the spatio-temporal EntityRelationship (ER) Model and the Extended spatio-temporal Unified Modeling Language(UML) as proposed in [33; 34] and [26]; respectively.,*,2003,44
Light-weight indexing of general bitemporal data,Rasa Bliujute; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Saltenis; Giedrius Slivinskas,Most data managed by existing; real-world database applications is time referenced. Often;two temporal aspects of data are of interest; namely valid time; when data is true in the mini-world; and transaction time; when data is current in the database; resulting in so-calledbitemporal data. Like spatial data; bitemporal data thus has associated two-dimensionalregions. Such data is in part naturally now-relative: some data is true until the current time;and some data is part of the current database state. So; unlike for spatial data; bitemporaldata regions may grow continuously. Existing indices; eg; B/sup+/and R-trees; typically donot contend well with even small amounts of now-relative data. In contrast; the 4-R indexpresented in the paper is capable of indexing general bitemporal data efficiently.

Design and analysis of a ranking approach to private location-based services,Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen; Jesper Møller; Hua Lu,Abstract Users of mobile services wish to retrieve nearby points of interest without disclosingtheir locations to the services. This article addresses the challenge of optimizing the queryperformance while satisfying given location privacy and query accuracy requirements. Thearticle's proposal; SpaceTwist; aims to offer location privacy for k nearest neighbor (kNN)queries at low communication cost without requiring a trusted anonymizer. The solution canbe used with a conventional DBMS as well as with a server optimized for location-basedservices. In particular; we believe that this is the first solution that expresses the server-sidefunctionality in a single SQL statement. In its basic form; SpaceTwist utilizes well-knownincremental NN query processing on the server. When augmented with a server-sidegranular search technique; SpaceTwist is capable of exploiting relaxed query accuracy …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,43
Research Challenges in Location-enabled M-services,Christian S Jensen,Rapid; sustained advances in key computing hardware technologies combine to enable anew class of computing services that aim to meet the needs of mobile users. Theseubiquitous and intelligent services adapt to each user's particular preferences and currentcircumstances; ie; they are personalized. The services exploit data available front multiplesources; including data on past interactions with users; data accessible via the Internet; anddata obtained from sensors. The user's geographical location is particularly central to theseservices. We outline some of the research challenges that aim to meet the computing of suchservices.

A foundation for vacuuming temporal databases,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen; Leo Mark,Abstract A wide range of real-world database applications; including financial and medicalapplications; are faced with accountability and traceability requirements. Theserequirements lead to the replacement of the usual update-in-place policy by an append-onlypolicy that retain all previous states in the database. This policy result in so-calledtransaction-time databases which are ever-growing. A variety of physical storage structuresand indexing techniques as well as query languages have been proposed for transaction-time databases; but the support for physical removal of data; termed vacuuming; has onlyreceived little attention. Such vacuuming is called for by; eg; the laws of many countries andthe policies of many businesses.

Stratum approaches to temporal DBMS implementation,Kristian Torp; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Previous approaches to implementing temporal DBMSs have assumed that a temporalDBMS must be built from scratch; employing an integrated architecture and using newtemporal implementation techniques such as temporal indexes and join algorithms.However; this is a very large and time-consuming task. The paper explores approaches toimplementing a temporal DBMS as a stratum on top of an existing non-temporal DBMS;rendering implementation more feasible by reusing much of the functionality of theunderlying conventional DBMS. More specifically; the paper introduces three stratum meta-architectures; each with several specific architectures. Based on a new set of evaluationcriteria; advantages and disadvantages of the specific architectures are identified.

Building accurate 3d spatial networks to enable next generation intelligent transportation systems,Manohar Kaul; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,The use of accurate 3D spatial network models can enable substantial improvements invehicle routing. Notably; such models enable eco-routing; which reduces the environmentalimpact of transportation. We propose a novel filtering and lifting framework that augments astandard 2D spatial network model with elevation information extracted from massive aeriallaser scan data and thus yields an accurate 3D model. We present a filtering technique thatis capable of pruning irrelevant laser scan points in a single pass; but assumes that the 2Dnetwork fits in internal memory and that the points are appropriately sorted. We also providean external-memory filtering technique that makes no such assumptions. During lifting; atriangulated irregular network (TIN) surface is constructed from the remaining points. The 2Dnetwork is projected onto the TIN; and a 3D network is constructed by means of …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,41
Evaluating the Completeness of TSQL2,Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract The question of what is a well-designed temporal data model and query languageis a difficult; but also an important one. The consensus temporal query language TSQL2attempts to take advantage of the accumulated knowledge gained from designing andstudying many of the earlier models and languages. In this sense; TSQL2 represents aconstructive answer to this question. Others have provided analytical answers by developingcriteria; formulated as completeness properties; for what is a good model and language.This paper applies important existing completeness notions to TSQL2 in order to evaluatethe design of TSQL2. It is shown that TSQL2 satisfies only a subset of these completenessnotions.,*,1995,41
Personalized trajectory matching in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search andmatching is increasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel problem calledpersonalized trajectory matching (PTM). In contrast to conventional trajectory similaritysearch by spatial distance only; PTM takes into account the significance of each samplepoint in a query trajectory. A PTM query takes a trajectory with user-specified weights foreach sample point in the trajectory as its argument. It returns the trajectory in an argumentdata set with the highest similarity to the query trajectory. We believe that this type of querymay bring significant benefits to users in many popular applications such as route planning;carpooling; friend recommendation; traffic analysis; urban computing; and location-basedservices in general.

Scalable top-k spatio-temporal term querying,Anders Skovsgaard; Darius Sidlauskas; Christian S Jensen,With the rapidly increasing deployment of Internet-connected; location-aware mobiledevices; very large and increasing amounts of geo-tagged and timestamped user-generatedcontent; such as microblog posts; are being generated. We present indexing; update; andquery processing techniques that are capable of providing the top-k terms seen in posts in auser-specified spatio-temporal range. The techniques enable interactive response times inthe millisecond range in a realistic setting where the arrival rate of posts exceeds today'saverage tweet arrival rate by a factor of 4-10. The techniques adaptively maintain the mostfrequent items at various spatial and temporal granularities. They extend existing frequentitem counting techniques to maintain exact counts rather than approximations.

S-GRID: A versatile approach to efficient query processing in spatial networks,Xuegang Huang; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Mobile services is emerging as an important application area for spatio-temporaldatabase management technologies. Service users are often constrained to a spatialnetwork; eg; a road network; through which points of interest; termed data points; areaccessible. Queries that implement services will often concern data points of some specifictype; eg; Thai restaurants or art museums. As a result; the relatively few data points arerelevant to a query in comparison to the number of network edges; meaning that queries; eg;k nearest-neighbor queries; must access large portions of the network. Existing queryprocessing techniques pre-compute distances between data points and network vertices forimproving the performance. However; pre-computation becomes problematic when thenetwork or data points must be updated; possibly concurrently with the querying; and if …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,38
Using incomplete information for complete weight annotation of road networks,Bin Yang; Manohar Kaul; Christian S Jensen,We are witnessing increasing interests in the effective use of road networks. For example; toenable effective vehicle routing; weighted-graph models of transportation networks areused; where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated with traversing the edge;eg; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graphmodel for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHGemissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However;GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all edges. Thispaper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in a road network withtravel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover only a small fraction ofthe edges; each with an associated ground-truth travel cost.

Introduction to temporal database research,Christian S Jensen,A wide range of database applications manage time-varying data. In contrast; existingdatabase technology provides little support for managing such data. The research area oftemporal databases aims to change this state of affairs by characterizing the semantics oftemporal data and providing expressive and efficient ways to model; store; and querytemporal data. This chapter offers a brief introduction to temporal database research. Itconcisely introduces fundamental temporal database concepts; surveys state-of-the-artsolutions to challenging aspects of temporal data management; and also offers a look intothe future of temporal database research.,Temporal database management,2000,37

Several integratedrepresentations; which capture different aspects of the same infrastructure; are needed.Furthermore; all other content that can be related to geographic space must be integratedwith the infrastructure representations.

An extensible notation for spatiotemporal index queries,Vassilis J Tsotras; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract Temporal; spatial and spatiotemporal queries are inherently multidimensional;combining predicates on explicit attributes with predicates on time dimension (s) and spatialdimension (s). Much confusion has prevailed in the literature on access methods becauseno consistent notation exists for referring to such queries. As a contribution towardseliminating this problem; we propose a new and simple notation for spatiotemporal queries.The notation aims to address the selection-based spatiotemporal queries commonly studiedin the literature of access methods. The notation is extensible and can be applied to moregeneral multidimensional; selection-based queries.,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,36

Temporal extensions of SQL offer substantial benefits over SQLwhen managing time-varying data. The topic of this paper is the effective implementation oftemporally extended SQL's. Traditionally; it has been assumed that a temporal DBMS mustbe built from scratch; utilizing new technologies for storage; indexing; query optimization;concurrency control; and recovery. In contrast; this paper explores the concepts andtechniques involved in implementing a temporally enhanced SQL while maximally reusingthe facilities of an existing SQL implementation.

This paper studiesthe use of such processors for the processing of update-intensive moving-object workloadsthat contain very frequent updates as well as contain queries. The non-trivial challengeaddressed is that of avoiding contention between long-running queries and frequentupdates. Specifically; the paper proposes a grid-based indexing technique. A static gridindexes a near up-to-date snapshot of the data to support queries; while a live grid supportsupdates. An efficient cloning technique that exploits the memcpy system call is used tomaintain the static grid. An empirical study conducted with three modern processors findsthat very frequent cloning; on the order of tens of milliseconds; is feasible; that the …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,35
Toward personalized; context-aware routing,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Yu Ma; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A driver's choice of a route to a destination may depend on the route's length andtravel time; but a multitude of other; possibly hard-to-formalize aspects; may also factor intothe driver's decision. There is evidence that a driver's choice of route is context dependent;eg; varies across time; and that route choice also varies from driver to driver. In contrast;conventional routing services support little in the way of context dependence; and theydeliver the same routes to all drivers. We study how to identify context-aware drivingpreferences for individual drivers from historical trajectories; and thus how to providefoundations for personalized navigation; but also professional driver education and trafficplanning. We provide techniques that are able to capture time-dependent and uncertainproperties of dynamic travel costs; such as travel time and fuel consumption; from …,The VLDB Journal,2015,34

Adaptable query optimization and evaluation in temporal middleware,Giedrius Slivinskas; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract Time-referenced data are pervasive in most real-world databases. Recentadvances in temporal query languages show that such database applications may benefitsubstantially from built-in temporal support in the DBMS. To achieve this; temporal queryoptimization and evaluation mechanisms must be provided; either within the DBMS properor as a source level translation from temporal queries to conventional SQL. This paperproposes a new approach: using a middleware component on top of a conventional DBMS.This component accepts temporal SQL statements and produces a corresponding queryplan consisting of algebraic as well as regular SQL parts. The algebraic parts are processedby the middleware; while the SQL parts are processed by the DBMS. The middleware usesperformance feedback from the DBMS to adapt its partitioning of subsequent queries into …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,33
EcoMark 2.0: empowering eco-routing with vehicular environmental models and actual vehicle fuel consumption data,Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Ove Andersen; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp,Abstract Eco-routing is a simple yet effective approach to substantially reducing theenvironmental impact; eg; fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; ofvehicular transportation. Eco-routing relies on the ability to reliably quantify theenvironmental impact of vehicles as they travel in a spatial network. The procedure ofquantifying such vehicular impact for road segments of a spatial network is called eco-weight assignment. EcoMark 2.0 proposes a general framework for eco-weight assignmentto enable eco-routing. It studies the abilities of six instantaneous and five aggregatedmodels to estimating vehicular environmental impact. In doing so; it utilizes travelinformation derived from GPS trajectories (ie; velocities and accelerations) and actual fuelconsumption data obtained from vehicles.

We study the efficient processing of continuously moving top-kspatial keyword (MkSK) queries over spatial text data. State-of-the-art solutions for movingqueries employ safe zones that guarantee the validity of reported results as long as the userremains within the safe zone associated with a result. However; existing safe-zone methodsfocus solely on spatial locations and ignore text relevancy. We propose two algorithms forcomputing safe zones that guarantee correct results at any time and that aim to optimize theserver-side computation as well as the communication between the server and the client.We exploit tight and conservative approximations of safe zones and aggressive …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,32
Trax: real-world tracking of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Stardas Pakalnis,Abstract A range of mobile services rely on knowing the current positions of populations ofso-called moving objects.

Thetechniques are readily relevant for practical applications; but they also have implications forcontinued research. The tracking techniques offer a realistic setting for existing queryprocessing techniques that assume that it is possible to always know the exact positions ofmoving objects.

Thisarticle presents several new approaches to exploiting the category information of questionsfor improving the performance of question retrieval; and it applies these approaches toexisting question retrieval models; including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model.Experiments conducted on real CQA data demonstrate that the proposed techniques areeffective and efficient and are capable of outperforming a variety of baseline methods …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2012,31
Map matching for intelligent speed adaptation,Nerius Tradišauskas; Jens Juhl; Harry Lahrmann; Christian S Jensen,The availability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) enables sophisticatedvehicle guidance and advisory systems such as Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) systems.In ISA systems; it is essential to be able to position vehicles within a road network. Becausedigital road networks as well as GNSS positioning are often inaccurate; a technique knownas map matching is needed that aims to use this inaccurate data for determining a vehicle'sreal road-network position. Then; knowing this position; an ISA system can compare speedwith the speed limit in effect and take measures against speeding. An on-line map-matchingalgorithm is presented with an extensive number of weighting parameters that allow betterdetermination of a vehicle's road network position. The algorithm uses certainty value toexpress its belief in the correctness of its results. The algorithm was designed and …,IET Intelligent Transport Systems,2009,31
Trajectory indexing using movement constraints,Dieter Pfoser; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the proliferation of mobile computing; the ability to index efficiently themovements of mobile objects becomes important. Objects are typically seen as moving intwo-dimensional (x; y) space; which means that their movements across time may beembedded in the three-dimensional (x; y; t) space. Further; the movements are typicallyrepresented as trajectories; sequences of connected line segments. In certain cases;movement is restricted; specifically; in this paper; we aim at exploiting that movements occurin transportation networks to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Briefly; the idea is toreduce movements to occur in one spatial dimension. As a consequence; the movementoccurs in two-dimensional (x; t) space. The advantages of considering such lower-dimensional trajectories are that the overall size of the data is reduced and that lower …,GeoInformatica,2005,31
Using differential technlques to efficiently support transaction time,Christian S Jensen; Leo Mark; Nick Roussopoulos; Timos Sells,Abstract We present an architecture for query processing in the relational model extendedwith transaction time. The architecture integrates standard query optimization andcomputation techniques with new differential computation techniques. Differentialcomputation computes a query incrementally or decrementally from the cahced and indexedresults of previous computations. The use of differential computation techniques is essentialin order to provide efficient processing of queries that access very large temporal relations.Alternative query plans are integrated into a state transition network; where the state spaceincludes backlogs of base relations; cached results from previous computations; a cacheindex; and intermediate results; the transitions include standard relational algebra operators;operators for constructing differential files; operators for differential computation; and …,The VLDB Journal,1993,31
Queries on change in an extended relational model,Christian S Jensen; Leo Mark,A data model that allows for the storage of detailed change history in so-called backlogrelations is described. Its extended relational algebra; in conjunction with the extended datastructures; provides a powerful tool for the retrieval of patterns and exceptions in changehistory. An operator; Sigma; based on the notion of compact active domain is introduced. Itgroups data not in predefined groups but in groups that fit the data. This operator furtherexpands the retrieval capabilities of the algebra. The expressive power of the algebra isdemonstrated by examples; some of which show how patterns and exceptions in changehistory can be detected. Sample applications of this work are statistical and scientificdatabases; monitoring (of databases; manufacturing plants; power plants; etc.); CAD; andCASE.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1992,31
Efficient metric indexing for similarity search,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Xinhan Li; Christian S Jensen; Gang Chen,The goal in similarity search is to find objects similar to a specified query object given acertain similarity criterion. Although useful in many areas; such as multimedia retrieval;pattern recognition; and computational biology; to name but a few; similarity search is not yetsupported well by commercial DBMS. This may be due to the complex data types involvedand the needs for flexible similarity criteria seen in real applications. We propose an efficientdisk-based metric access method; the Space-filling curve and Pivot-based B+-tree (SPB-tree); to support a wide range of data types and similarity metrics. The SPB-tree uses a smallset of so-called pivots to reduce significantly the number of distance computations; uses aspace-filling curve to cluster the data into compact regions; thus improving storageefficiency; and utilizes a B+-tree with minimum bounding box information as the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,30
Ecotour: Reducing the environmental footprint of vehicles using eco-routes,Ove Andersen; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp; Bin Yang,Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is essential in combating globalwarming and climate change. Eco-routing enables drivers to use the most eco-friendlyroutes and is effective in reducing vehicle emissions. The EcoTour system assigns eco-weights to a road network based on GPS and fuel consumption data collected from vehiclesto enable ecorouting. Given an arbitrary source-destination pair in Denmark; EcoTourreturns the shortest route; the fastest route; and the eco-route; along with statistics for thethree routes. EcoTour also serves as a testbed for exploring advanced solutions to a rangeof challenges related to eco-routing.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,30
Spatio-temporal joins on symbolic indoor tracking data,Hua Lu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,To facilitate a variety of applications; positioning systems are deployed in indoor settings.For example; Bluetooth and RFID positioning are deployed in airports to support real-timemonitoring of delays as well as off-line flow and space usage analyses. Such deploymentsgenerate large collections of tracking data. Like in other data management applications;joins are indispensable in this setting. However; joins on indoor tracking data call for noveltechniques that take into account the limited capabilities of the positioning systems as wellas the specifics of indoor spaces. This paper proposes and studies probabilistic; spatio-temporal joins on historical indoor tracking data. Two meaningful types of join are defined.They return object pairs that satisfy spatial join predicates either at a time point or during atime interval. The predicates considered include “same X;” where X is a semantic region …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,30
Enabling location-based services—multi-graph representation of transportation networks,Laurynas Speičys; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Advances in wireless communications; positioning technologies; and consumerelectronics combine to enable a range of applications that use a mobile user's geo-spatiallocation to deliver on-line; location-enhanced services; often referred to as location-basedservices. This paper assumes that the service users are constrained to a transportationnetwork; and it delves into the modeling of such networks; points of interest; and the serviceusers with the objective of supporting location-based services. In particular; the paperpresents a framework that encompasses two interrelated models—a two-dimensional;spatial representation and a multi-graph presentation. The former; high-fidelity model maybe used for the positioning of content and users in the infrastructure (eg; using mapmatching). The latter type of model is recognized as an ideal basis for a variety of query …,GeoInformatica,2008,30
The COST benchmark—comparison and evaluation of spatio-temporal indexes,Christian S Jensen; Dalia Tiešytė; Nerius Tradišauskas,Abstract An infrastructure is emerging that enables the positioning of populations of on-line;mobile service users. In step with this; research in the management of moving objects hasattracted substantial attention. In particular; quite a few proposals now exist for the indexingof moving objects; and more are underway. As a result; there is an increasing need for anindependent benchmark for spatio-temporal indexes. This paper characterizes the spatio-temporal indexing problem and proposes a benchmark for the performance evaluation andcomparison of spatio-temporal indexes.

R-tree based indexing of general spatio-temporal data,Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Real-world objects are inherently spatially and temporally referenced; and manydatabase applications rely on databases that record the past; present; and anticipated futurelocations of; eg; people or land parcels. As a result; indices that efficiently support queries onthe spatio-temporal extents of objects are needed. In contrast; past indexing research hasprogressed in largely separate spatial and temporal streams. In the former; focus has beenon one-; two-; or three-dimensional space; and in the latter; focus has been on one or both ofthe temporal aspects; or dimensions; of data known as transaction time and valid time.Adding time dimensions to spatial indices; as if time was a spatial dimension; neithersupports nor exploits the special properties of time. On the other hand; temporal indices aregenerally not amenable to extension with spatial dimensions. This paper proposes an …,History,1999,30
Unification of temporal data models,Christian S Jensen; Michael D Soo; Richard T Snodgrass,A conceptual temporal data model that captures the time-dependent semantics of data whilepermitting multiple data models at the representation level is described. A conceptual notionof a bitemporal relation in which tuples are stamped with sets of two-dimensional chrononsin transaction-time/valid-time space is defined. A tuple-timestamped first normal formrepresentation is introduced to show how the conceptual bitemporal data model is related;by means of snapshot equivalence; with representational models. Querying within the two-level framework is discussed. An algebra is defined at the conceptual level and mapped tothe sample representational model in such a way that new operators compute equivalentresults for different representations of the same conceptual bitemporal relation.,Data Engineering; 1993.

Answering why-not questions on spatial keyword top-k queries,Lei Chen; Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Christian S Jensen; Jianliang Xu,Large volumes of geo-tagged text objects are available on the web. Spatial keyword top-kqueries retrieve k such objects with the best score according to a ranking function that takesinto account a query location and query keywords. In this setting; users may wonder whysome known object is unexpectedly missing from a result; and understanding why may aidusers in retrieving better results. While spatial keyword querying has been studiedintensively; no proposals exist for how to offer users explanations of why such expectedobjects are missing from results. We provide techniques that allow the revision of spatialkeyword queries such that their results include one or more desired; but missing objects. Indoing so; we adopt a query refinement approach to provide a basic algorithm that reducesthe problem to a two-dimensional geometrical problem. To improve performance; we …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,29
Lightweight graphical models for selectivity estimation without independence assumptions,Kostas Tzoumas; Amol Deshpande; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT As a result of decades of research and industrial development; modern queryoptimizers are complex software artifacts. However; the quality of the query plan chosen byan optimizer is largely determined by the quality of the underlying statistical summaries.Small selectivity estimation errors; propagated exponentially; can lead to severely sub-optimal plans. Modern optimizers typically maintain one-dimensional statistical summariesand make the attribute value independence and join uniformity assumptions for efficientlyestimating selectivities. Therefore; selectivity estimation errors in today's optimizers arefrequently caused by missed correlations between attributes. We present a selectivityestimation approach that does not make the independence assumptions. By carefully usingconcepts from the field of graphical models; we are able to factor the joint probability …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,29
Algorithmic strategies for adapting to environmental changes in 802.11 location fingerprinting,Rene Hansen; Rico Wind; Christian S Jensen; Bent Thomsen,Ubiquitous and accurate indoor positioning represents a key capability of an infrastructurethat enables indoor location-based services. At the same time; such positioning has yet to beachieved. Much research uses commercial; off-the-shelf 802.11 (Wi-Fi) hardware for indoorpositioning. In particular; the dominant fingerprinting technique uses a database (called aradio map) of manually collected Wi-Fi signal strengths and is able to achieve positioningaccuracies that enable a wide range of location-based services. However; a majorweakness of fingerprinting occurs when changes occur in the indoor environment that causethe signal propagation patterns and thus signal strength to change. Under suchcircumstances; a radio map collected at one time is unable to offer accurate positioning at alltimes. We propose a data-centric approach to achieving accurate positioning in changing …,Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN); 2010 International Conference on,2010,29
Retrieving regions of interest for user exploration,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract We consider an application scenario where points of interest (PoIs) each have aweb presence and where a web user wants to identify a region that contains relevant PoIsthat are relevant to a set of keywords; eg; in preparation for deciding where to go toconveniently explore the PoIs. Motivated by this; we propose the length-constrainedmaximum-sum region (LCMSR) query that returns a spatial-network region that is locatedwithin a general region of interest; that does not exceed a given size constraint; and that bestmatches query keywords. Such a query maximizes the total weight of the PoIs in it wrt thequery keywords. We show that it is NP-hard to answer this query. We develop anapproximation algorithm with a (5+ ε) approximation ratio utilizing a technique that scalesnode weights into integers. We also propose a more efficient heuristic algorithm and a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,28

Object-extended OLAP querying,Torben Bach Pedersen; Junmin Gu; Arie Shoshani; Christian S Jensen,Abstract On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems based on a dimensional view of datahave found widespread use in business applications and are being used increasingly in non-standard applications. These systems provide good performance and ease-of-use.However; the complex structures and relationships inherent in data in non-standardapplications are not accommodated well by OLAP systems. In contrast; object databasesystems are built to handle such complexity; but do not support OLAP-type querying well.This paper presents the concepts and techniques underlying a flexible;“multi-model”federated system that enables OLAP users to exploit simultaneously the features of OLAPand object systems. The system allows data to be handled using the most appropriate datamodel and technology: OLAP systems for dimensional data and object database systems …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,27
Specification-based data reduction in dimensional data warehouses,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Many data warehouses contain massive amounts of data; accumulated over longperiods of time. In some cases; it is necessary or desirable to either delete “old” data or tomaintain the data at an aggregate level. This may be due to privacy concerns; in which casethe data are aggregated to levels that ensure anonymity. Another reason is the desire tomaintain a balance between the uses of data that change as the data age and the size of thedata; thus avoiding overly large data warehouses. This paper presents effective techniquesfor data reduction that enable the gradual aggregation of detailed data as the data ages.With these techniques; data may be aggregated to higher levels as they age; enabling themaintenance of more compact; consolidated data and the compliance with privacyrequirements. Special care is taken to avoid semantic problems in the aggregation …,Information Systems,2008,27
Workload-aware indexing of continuously moving objects,Kostas Tzoumas; Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The increased deployment of sensors and data communication networks yieldsdata management workloads with update loads that are intense; skewed; and highly bursty.Query loads resulting from location-based services are expected to exhibit similarcharacteristics. In such environments; index structures can easily become performancebottlenecks. We address the need for indexing that is adaptive to the workloadcharacteristics; called workload-aware; in order to cover the space in between maintainingan accurate index; and having no index at all. Our proposal; QU-Trade; extends R-tree typeindexing and achieves workload-awareness by controlling the underlying index's filteringquality. QU-Trade safely drops index updates; increasing the overlap in the index when theworkload is update-intensive; and it restores the filtering capabilities of the index when …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,26
Enabling routes of road network constrained movements as mobile service context,Agnė Brilingaitė; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the continuing advances in wireless communications; geo-positioning; andportable electronics; an infrastructure is emerging that enables the delivery of on-line;location-enabled services to very large numbers of mobile users. A typical usage situationfor mobile services is one characterized by a small screen and no keyboard; and by theservice being only a secondary focus of the user. Under such circumstances; it is particularlyimportant to deliver the “right” information and service at the right time; with as little userinteraction as possible. This may be achieved by making services context aware. Mobileusers frequently follow the same route to a destination as they did during previous trips tothe destination; and the route and destination constitute important aspects of the context fora range of services.

A foundation for conventional and temporal query optimization addressing duplicates and ordering,Giedrius Slivinskas; Christian S.  Jensen; Richard T.  Snodgrass,Most real-world databases contain substantial amounts of time-referenced; or temporal;data. Recent advances in temporal query languages show that such database applicationsmay benefit substantially from built-in temporal support in the DBMS. To achieve this;temporal query representation; optimization; and processing mechanisms must be provided.This paper presents a foundation for query optimization that integrates conventional andtemporal query optimization and is suitable for both conventional DBMS architectures andones where the temporal support is obtained via a layer on top of a conventional DBMS.This foundation captures duplicates and ordering for all queries; as well as coalescing fortemporal queries; thus generalizing all existing approaches known to the authors.

Temporally Enhanced Database Design.,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The design of appropriate database schemas is critical to the effective use of databasetechnology and the construction of effective information systems that exploit this technology.The temporal aspects of database schemas are often particularly complex and thus difficultand error-prone to design. This chapter focuses on the temporal aspects of databaseschemas. Its contributions are two-fold. First; a comprehensive set of concepts are presentedthat capture temporal aspects of schemas. Second; the use of these concepts for databasedesign is explored. The chapter first generalizes conventional functional dependencies toapply to temporal databases; leading to temporal keys and normal forms.

Routing Service Quality--Local Driver Behavior Versus Routing Services,Vaida Ceikute; Christian S Jensen,Mobile location-based services is a very successful class of services that are being usedfrequently by users with GPS-enabled mobile devices such as smartphones. This paperpresents a study of how to exploit GPS trajectory data; which is available in increasingvolumes; for the assessment of the quality of one kind of location-based service; namelyrouting services. Specifically; the paper presents a framework that enables the comparisonof the routes provided by routing services with the actual driving behaviors of local drivers.Comparisons include route length; travel time; and also route popularity; which are enabledby common driving behaviors found in available trajectory data. The ability to evaluate thequality of routing services enables service providers to improve the quality of their servicesand enables users to identify the services that best serve their needs.

Flexible and efficient resolution of skyline query size constraints,Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen; Zhenjie Zhang,Given a set of multidimensional points; a skyline query returns the interesting points that arenot dominated by other points. It has been observed that the actual cardinality (s) of a skylinequery result may differ substantially from the desired result cardinality (k); which hasprompted studies on how to reduce s for the case where k<; s. This paper goes further byaddressing the general case where the relationship between k and s is not knownbeforehand. Due to their complexity; the existing pointwise ranking and set-widemaximization techniques are not well suited for this problem. Moreover; the former oftenincurs too many ties in its ranking; and the latter is inapplicable for k>; s. Based on theseobservations; the paper proposes a new approach; called skyline ordering; that forms askyline-based partitioning of a given data set such that an order exists among the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,25

Effective online group discovery in trajectory databases,Xiaohui Li; Vaida Ceikute; Christian S Jensen; Kian-Lee Tan,GPS-enabled devices are pervasive nowadays. Finding movement patterns in trajectorydata stream is gaining in importance. We propose a group discovery framework that aims toefficiently support the online discovery of moving objects that travel together. The frameworkadopts a sampling-independent approach that makes no assumptions about when positionsare sampled; gives no special importance to sampling points; and naturally supports the useof approximate trajectories. The framework's algorithms exploit state-of-the-art; density-based clustering (DBScan) to identify groups. The groups are scored based on theircardinality and duration; and the top-k groups are returned. To avoid returning similarsubgroups in a result; notions of domination and similarity are introduced that enable thepruning of low-interest groups.

Temporal database,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,23
Bringing order to query optimization,Giedrius Slivinskas; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract A variety of developments combine to highlight the need for respecting order whenmanipulating relations. For example; new functionality is being added to SQL to supportOLAP-style querying in which order is frequently an important aspect. The set-or multiset-based frameworks for query optimization that are currently being taught to databasestudents are increasingly inadequate. This paper presents a foundation for queryoptimization that extends existing frameworks to also capture ordering. A list-basedrelational algebra is provided along with three progressively stronger types of algebraicequivalences; concrete query transformation rules that obey the different equivalences; anda procedure for determining which types of transformation rules are applicable for optimizinga query.

Efficient processing of spatial group keyword queries,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Tao Guo; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging techniques; spatio-textualobjects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining inprevalence; and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual descriptionare gaining in prominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on findingindividual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where theobjects in a group together satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group ofspatio-textual objects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and suchthat the objects are nearest to the query location and have the smallest inter-objectdistances. Specifically; we study three instantiations of this problem; all of which are NP-hard.

Spatial joins in main memory: Implementation matters!,Darius Šidlauskas; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A recent PVLDB paper reports on experimental analyses of ten spatial jointechniques in main memory. We build on this comprehensive study to raise awareness ofthe fact that empirical running time performance findings in main-memory settings are resultsof not only the algorithms and data structures employed; but also their implementation;which complicates the interpretation of the results. In particular; we re-implement the worstperforming technique without changing the underlying high-level algorithm; and we thenoffer evidence that the resulting re-implementation is capable of outperforming all the othertechniques. This study demonstrates that in main memory; where no time-consuming I/O canmask variations in implementation; implementation details are very important; and it offers aconcrete illustration of how it is difficult to make conclusions from empirical running time …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,22

Modification semantics in now-relative databases,Kristian Torp; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Most real-world databases record time-varying information. In such databases; thenotion of “the current time;” or NOW; occurs naturally and prominently. For example; whencapturing the past states of a relation using begin and end time columns; tuples that are partof the current state have some past time as their begin time and NOW as their end time.While the semantics of such variable databases has been described in detail and is wellunderstood; the modification of variable databases remains unexplored. This paper definesthe semantics of modifications involving the variable NOW. More specifically; the problemswith modifications in the presence of NOW are explored; illustrating that the main problemsare with modifications of tuples that reach into the future. The paper defines the semantics ofmodifications—including insertions; deletions; and updates—of databases without NOW …,Information Systems,2004,22
Object-relational management of multiply represented geographic entities,Anders Friis-Christensen; Christian S Jensen,Multiple representations occur when information about the same geographic entity isrepresented electronically more than once. This occurs frequently in practice; and itinvariably results in the occurrence of inconsistencies among the different representations.We propose to resolve this situation by introducing a multiple representation managementsystem (MRMS); the schema of which includes rules that specify how to identifyrepresentations of the same entity; rules that specify consistency requirements; and rulesused to restore consistency when necessary. In this paper; we demonstrate by means of aprototype and a real-world case study that it is possible to implement a multiplerepresentation schema language on top of an object-relational database managementsystem. Specifically; it is demonstrated how it is possible to map the constructs of the …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,22
Discovery of path nearby clusters in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Bin Yang; Panos Kalnis; Guohe Li; Ji-Rong Wen,The discovery of regions of interest in large cities is an important challenge. We propose andinvestigate a novel query called the path nearby cluster (PNC) query that finds regions ofpotential interest (eg; sightseeing places and commercial districts) with respect to a user-specified travel route. Given a set of spatial objects O (eg; POIs; geo-tagged photos; or geo-tagged tweets) and a query route q; if a cluster c has high spatial-object density and isspatially close to q; it is returned by the query (a cluster is a circular region defined by acenter and a radius). This query aims to bring important benefits to users in popularapplications such as trip planning and location recommendation. Efficient computation of thePNC query faces two challenges: how to prune the search space during query processing;and how to identify clusters with high density effectively.

Basic eco-routing returns the most eco-friendly routes; skyline eco-routingtakes into account not only fuel consumption but also travel time and distance whencomputing eco-routes; and personalized eco-routing considers each driver's past behaviorand accordingly suggests different routes to different drivers.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,21
Capturing temporal constraints in temporal ER models,Carlo Combi; Sara Degani; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A wide range of database applications manage information that varies over time.The conceptual modeling of databases is frequently based on one of the several versions ofthe ER model. As this model does not provide built-in means for capturing temporal aspectsof data; the resulting diagrams are unnecessarily obscure and inadequate fordocumentation purposes. The TimeER model extends the ER model with suitable constructsfor modeling time-varying information; easing the design process; and leading to easy-to-understand diagrams. In a temporal ER model; support for the specification of advancedtemporal constraints would be desiderable; allowing the designer to specify; eg; that thevalue of an attribute must not change over time. This paper extends the TimeER model byintroducing the notation; and the associated semantics; for the specification of new …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2008,21
A Streams-Based Framework for Defining Location-Based Queries,Xuegang Huang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract An infrastructure is emerging that supports the delivery of on-line; location-enabledservices to mobile users. Such services involve novel database queries; and the databaseresearch community is quite active in proposing techniques for the efficient processing ofsuch queries. In parallel to this; the management of data streams has become an active areaof research. While most research in mobile services concerns performance issues; thispaper aims to establish a formal framework for defining the semantics of queriesencountered in mobile services; most notably the so-called continuous queries that areparticularly relevant in this context. Rather than inventing an entirely new framework; thepaper proposes a framework that builds on concepts from data streams and temporaldatabases. Definitions of example queries demonstrates how the framework enables …,History April 2007. A DB Technical Report. Extended version of: X.

Indexing of now-relative spatio-bitemporal data,Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Real-world entities are inherently spatially and temporally referenced; anddatabase applications increasingly exploit databases that record the past; present; andanticipated future locations of entities; eg; the residences of customers obtained by the geo-coding of addresses. Indices that efficiently support queries on the spatio-temporal extents ofsuch entities are needed. However; past indexing research has progressed in largelyseparate spatial and temporal streams. Adding time dimensions to spatial indices; as if timewere a spatial dimension; neither supports nor exploits the special properties of time. On theother hand; temporal indices are generally not amenable to extension with spatialdimensions.

Query plans for conventional and temporal queries involving duplicates and ordering,Giedrius Slivinskas; Christian S Jensen; RT Snodgras,Most real-world database applications contain a substantial portion of time references; ortemporal data. Recent advances in temporal query languages show that such databaseapplications could benefit substantially from built-in temporal support in the DBMS. Toachieve this; temporal query representation; optimization and processing mechanisms mustbe provided. This paper presents a general algebraic foundation for query optimization thatintegrates conventional and temporal query optimization and is suitable for providingtemporal support both via a stand-alone temporal DBMS and via a layer on top of aconventional DBMS. By capturing duplicate removal and retention and order preservationfor all queries; as well as coalescence for temporal queries; this foundation formalizes andgeneralizes existing approaches.,Data Engineering; 2000.

Efficiently adapting graphical models for selectivity estimation,Kostas Tzoumas; Amol Deshpande; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Query optimizers rely on statistical models that succinctly describe the underlyingdata. Models are used to derive cardinality estimates for intermediate relations; which in turnguide the optimizer to choose the best query execution plan. The quality of the resulting planis highly dependent on the accuracy of the statistical model that represents the data. It is wellknown that small errors in the model estimates propagate exponentially through joins; andmay result in the choice of a highly sub-optimal query execution plan. Most commercialquery optimizers make the attribute value independence assumption: all attributes areassumed to be statistically independent. This reduces the statistical model of the data to acollection of one-dimensional synopses (typically in the form of histograms); and it permitsthe optimizer to estimate the selectivity of a predicate conjunction as the product of the …,The VLDB Journal,2013,20

Multiple k nearest neighbor query processing in spatial network databases,Xuegang Huang; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract This paper concerns the efficient processing of multiple k nearest neighbor queriesin a road-network setting. The assumed setting covers a range of scenarios such as the onewhere a large population of mobile service users that are constrained to a road networkissue nearest-neighbor queries for points of interest that are accessible via the road network.Given multiple k nearest neighbor queries; the paper proposes progressive techniques thatselectively cache query results in main memory and subsequently reuse these for queryprocessing. The paper initially proposes techniques for the case where an upper bound on kis known a priori and then extends the techniques to the case where this is not so.

Using the lock manager to choose timestamps,David Lomet; Richard T Snodgrass; Christian S Jensen,Our goal is to support transaction-time functionality that enables the coexistence of ordinary;non-temporal tables with transaction-time tables. In such a system; each transactionupdating a transaction-time or snapshot table must include a timestamp for its updated datathat correctly reflects the serialization order of the transactions; including transactions onordinary tables. A serious issue is coping with SQL CURRENT/spl I. bar/TIME functions;which should return a time consistent with a transaction's timestamp and serialization order.Prior timestamping techniques cannot support such junctions with this desired semantics.We show how to compatibly extend conventional database functionality for transaction-timesupport by exploiting the database system lock manager and by utilizing a spectrum ofoptimizations.,Database Engineering and Application Symposium; 2005.

Incomplete information in multidimensional databases,Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT While incomplete information is endemic to real-world data; currentmultidimensional data models are not engineered to manage incomplete information inbase data; derived data; and dimensions. This chapter presents several strategies formanaging incomplete information in multidimensional databases. Which strategy to use isdependent on the kind of incomplete information present; and also on where it occurs in themultidimensional database. A relatively simple strategy is to replace incomplete informationwith appropriate; complete information. The advantage of this strategy is that allmultidimensional databases can manage complete information. Other strategies requiremore substantial changes to the multidimensional database. One strategy is to reflect theincompleteness in computed aggregates; which is possible only if the multidimensional …,Multidimensional databases: problems and solutions,2003,20
Specification-based data reduction in dimensional data warehouses,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Many data warehouses contain massive amounts of data and grow rapidly.Examples include warehouses with retail sales data capturing customer behavior andwarehouses with click-stream data capturing user behavior on web sites. The sheer size ofthese warehouses makes them increasingly hard to manage and query efficiently. As timepasses; old; detailed data in the warehouses tend to become less interesting. However;higher-level summaries of the data; taking up far less space; continue to be of interest. Thus;it is possible to perform data reduction in dimensional data warehouses by aggregating datato higher levels in the dimensions. This paper presents an effective technique for datareduction that handles the gradual change of the data from new; detailed data to older;summarized data.

We proposeand investigate a novel Collective Travel Planning (CTP) query that finds the lowest-costroute connecting multiple sources and a destination; via at most $ k $ meeting points. Whenmultiple travelers target the same destination (eg; a stadium or a theater); they may want toassemble at meeting points and then go together to the destination by public transport toreduce their global travel cost (eg; energy; money; or greenhouse-gas emissions).

Indoor positioning using wi-fi–how well is the problem understood?,Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard; Mads Vering Krarup; Allan Stisen; Thor Siiger Prentow; Henrik Blunck; Kaj Grønbæk; Christian S Jensen,Abstract—The past decade has witnessed substantial research on methods for indoor Wi-Fipositioning. While much effort has gone into achieving high positioning accuracy and easingfingerprint collection; it is our contention that the general problem is not sufficiently wellunderstood; thus preventing deployments and their usage by applications to become morewidespread. Based on our own and published experiences on indoor Wi-Fi positioningdeployments; we hypothesize the following: Current indoor Wi-Fi positioning systems andtheir utilization in applications are hampered by the lack of understanding of therequirements present in the real-world deployments.

A conceptual schema language for the management of multiple representations of geographic entities,Anders Friis‐Christensen; Christian S Jensen; Jan P Nytun; David Skogan,Abstract Multiple representation of geographic information occurs when a real-world entity isrepresented more than once in the same or different databases. This occurs frequently inpractice; and it invariably results in the occurrence of inconsistencies among the differentrepresentations of the same entity. In this paper; we propose an approach to the modeling ofmultiple represented entities; which is based on the relationships among the entities andtheir representations. Central to our approach is the Multiple Representation SchemaLanguage that; by intuitive and declarative means; is used to specify rules that match objectsrepresenting the same entity; maintain consistency among these representations; andrestore consistency if necessary. The rules configure a Multiple RepresentationManagement System; the aim of which is to manage multiple representations over a …,Transactions in GIS,2005,19
Enabling routes as context in mobile services,Agne Brilingaite; Christian S Jensen; Nora Zokaite,Abstract With the continuing advances in wireless communications; geo-positioning; andportable electronics; an infrastructure is emerging that enables the delivery of on-line;location-enabled services to very large numbers of mobile users. A typical usage situationfor mobile services is one characterized by a small screen and no keyboard; and by theservice being only a secondary focus of the user. It is therefore particularly important todeliver the" right" information and service at the right time; with as little user interaction aspossible. This may be achieved by making services context aware. Mobile users frequentlyfollow the same route to a destination as they did during previous trips to the destination;and the route and destination are important aspects of the context for a range of services.This paper presents key concepts underlying a software component that discovers the …,Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM international workshop on Geographic information systems,2004,19

Modeling topological constraints in spatial part-whole relationships,Rosanne Price; Nectaria Tryfona; Christian S Jensen,Abstract To facilitate development of spatial applications; we investigate the problem ofmodeling topological constraints in part-whole relationships between spatial objects; wherethe related objects may themselves be composite. An example would be countries thatbelong to a supranational organization; where the countries are themselves composed ofstates. Current topological classification schemes are restricted to simple; bounded; regular;and/or 0-2D spatial data types; do not support the set-based topological constraints requiredto describe inter-part relationships such as those between members of a supranationalorganization; and focus primarily on query rather than design. We propose an approach tomodeling topological relationships that allows specification of binary and set-basedtopological constraints on composite spatial objects.

Semantics of time-varying attributes and their use for temporal database design,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Based on a systematic study of the semantics of temporal attributes of entities; thispaper provides new guidelines for the design of temporal relational databases. The notionsof observation and update patterns of an attribute capture when the attribute changes valueand when the changes are recorded in the database. A lifespan describes when an attributehas a value. And derivation functions describe how the values of an attribute for all timeswithin its lifespan are computed from stored values. The implications for temporal databasedesign of the semantics that may be captured using these concepts are formulated asschema decomposition rules.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1995,19

Towards increasingly update efficient moving-object indexing,Christian S.  Jensen; Simonas Saltenis,Abstract Current moving-object indexing concentrates on point-objects capable ofcontinuous movement in one-; two-; and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces; and mostapproaches are based on well-known; conventional spatial indices. Approaches that aim atindexing the current and anticipated future positions of moving objects generally mustcontend with very large update loads because of the agility of the objects indexed. At thesame time; conventional spatial indices were often originally proposed in settingscharacterized by few updates and focus on query performance. In this paper; wecharacterize the challenge of moving-object indexing and discuss a range of techniques; theuse of which may lead to better update performance.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,18
Authentication of moving top-k spatial keyword queries,Dingming Wu; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,A moving top-k spatial keyword (MkSK) query; which takes into account a continuouslymoving query location; enables a mobile client to be continuously aware of the top-k spatialweb objects that best match a query with respect to location and text relevance. Theincreasing mobile use of the web and the proliferation of geo-positioning render it of interestto consider a scenario where spatial keyword search is outsourced to a separate serviceprovider capable at handling the voluminous spatial web objects available from varioussources. A key challenge is that the service provider may return inaccurate or incorrect queryresults (intentionally or not); eg; due to cost considerations or invasion of hackers. Therefore;it is attractive to be able to authenticate the query results at the client side.

On the ontological expressiveness of temporal extensions to the entity-relationship model,Heidi Gregersen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract It is widely recognized that temporal aspects of database schemas are prevalent;but also difficult to capture using the ER model. The database research community'sresponse has been to develop temporally enhanced ER models. However; these modelshave not been subjected to systematic evaluation. In contrast; the evaluation of modelingmethodologies for information systems development is a very active area of research in theinformation systems engineering community. Based on a framework from informationsystems engineering; this paper evaluates the ontological expressiveness of three differenttemporal enhancements to the ER model. The three temporal ER model extensions are well-documented; and together the models represent a substantial range of the design space fortemporal ER extensions.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1999,17

Multidimensionalmodels more specifically categorize data as either facts—which are the entities of interestwrt the analyses at hand; eg; a purchase in a retail business—or dimensions; which aremostly textual and characterize the facts; eg; the location of the purchase; the product beingpurchased; and the time of the purchase.

Incremental join of time-oriented data,Dieter Pfoser; Christian S Jensen,Data warehouses as well as a wide range of other databases exhibit a strong temporalorientation: it is important to track the temporal variation of data over several months oryears. In addition; databases often exhibit append-only characteristics where old data isretained while new data is appended. Performing joins efficiently on large databases suchas these is essential to obtain good overall query processing performance. The paperpresents a sort-merge based incremental algorithm for time oriented data. While incrementalcomputation techniques have proven competitive in many settings; they also introduce aspace overhead in the form of differential files. For the temporal data explored here; thisoverhead is avoided because the differential files are already part of the database. Inaddition; data is naturally sorted; leaving only merging.

In this sense; TSQL2 represents aconstructive answer to this question. Others have provided analytical answers by developingcriteria; formulated as completeness properties; for what is a good model and language.This paper applies important existing completeness notions to TSQL2 in order to evaluatethe design of TSQL2. It is shown that TSQL2 satisfies only a subset of these completenessnotions. In response to this; a minimally modified version of TSQL2; termed Applied TSQL2;is proposed; this new language satisfies the notions of temporal semi-completeness and …,*,1995,16

However; it is insome cases difficult for users to identify the exact keywords that describe their query intent.After a user issues an initial query and gets back the result; the user may find that someexpected objects are missing and may wonder why. Answering the resulting why-notquestions can aid users in retrieving better results. However; no existing techniques are ableto answer why-not questions by adapting the query keywords.

Processing of extreme moving-object update and query workloads in main memory,Darius Šidlauskas; Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The efficient processing of workloads that interleave moving-object updates andqueries is challenging. In addition to the conflicting needs for update-efficient versus query-efficient data structures; the increasing parallel capabilities of multi-core processors yieldchallenges. To prevent concurrency anomalies and to ensure correct system behavior;conflicting update and query operations must be serialized. In this setting; it is a key concernto avoid that operations are blocked; which leaves processing cores idle. To enable efficientprocessing; we first examine concurrency degrees from traditional transaction processing inthe context of our target domain and propose new semantics that enable a high degree ofparallelism and ensure up-to-date query results. We define the new semantics for range andk k-nearest neighbor queries. Then; we present a main-memory indexing technique …,The VLDB Journal,2014,15

Furthermore; we have observedthat a real trajectory of a moving object is the result of interactions among moving objects inthe system yielding a polyline instead of a line segment. In this paper; we first choose apartitioning approach to efficiently manage such trajectory information and develop a systemcalled RouteManager based on a space-time grid that manages moving objects in a one-dimensional space. We then extend this to two-dimensional space. The time-dependentshortest path problem is an interesting application where such a system can be used.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,14

The current paradigm represents a road network as aweighted graph; it blasts trajectories into small fragments that fit the under-lying edges toassign weights to edges; and it then applies a routing algorithm to the resulting graph. Wepropose a new paradigm; the hybrid graph; that targets more accurate and more efficientpath cost distribution estimation. The new paradigm avoids blasting trajectories into smallfragments and instead assigns weights to paths rather than simply to the edges.

In this problem; the entire space with the exception of the safe zones is unsafe; butpassable; and it differs from problems that involve unsafe regions to be strictly avoided. As aresult; existing algorithms are not effective solutions to the new problem. To solve theEuclidean variant; we devise a transformation of the continuous data space with safe zonesinto a discrete graph upon which shortest path algorithms apply.

While travel-time prediction has been researched extensively during the pastdecade; the accuracies of existing techniques fall short of what is desired; and proposedmathematical prediction models are often not transferable to other systems because theproperties of the travel-time-related data of vehicles are highly context-dependent; makingthe models difficult to fit. We propose a framework for evaluating various predictability typesof the data independently of the model; and we also compare predictability analysis …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,13

Space-Time Aware Behavioral Topic Modeling for Microblog Posts.,Qiang Qu; Cen Chen; Christian S Jensen; Anders Skovsgaard,Abstract How can we automatically identify the topics of microblog posts? This question hasreceived substantial attention in the research community and has led to the development ofdifferent topic models; which are mathematically well-founded statistical models that enablethe discovery of topics in document collections. Such models can be used for topic analysesaccording to the interests of user groups; time; geographical locations; or social behaviorpatterns. The increasing availability of microblog posts with associated users; textualcontent; timestamps; geo-locations; and user behaviors; offers an opportunity to study space-time dependent behavioral topics. Such a topic is described by a set of words; thedistribution of which varies according to the time; geo-location; and behaviors (that capturehow a user interacts with other users by using functionality such as reply or re-tweet) of …,IEEE Data Eng.

Efficient top-k spatial locality search for co-located spatial web objects,Qiang Qu; Siyuan Liu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,In step with the web being used widely by mobile users; user location is becoming anessential signal in services; including local intent search. Given a large set of spatial webobjects consisting of a geographical location and a textual description (eg; Online businessdirectory entries of restaurants; bars; and shops); how can we find sets of objects that areboth spatially and textually relevant to a query? Most of existing studies solve the problem byrequiring that all query keywords are covered by the returned objects and then rank the setsby spatial proximity. The needs for identifying sets with more textually relevant objectsrender these studies inapplicable. We propose locality Search; a query that returns top-ksets of spatial web objects and integrates spatial distance and textual relevance in oneranking function. We show that computing the query is NP-hard; and we present two …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,12
Identifying Typical Movements among Indoor Objects--Concepts and Empirical Study,Laura Radaelli; Dovydas Sabonis; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,With the proliferation of mobile computing; positioning systems are becoming available thatenable indoor location-based services. As a result; indoor tracking data is also becomingavailable. This paper puts focus on one use of such data; namely the identification of typicalmovement patterns among indoor moving objects. Specifically; the paper presents a methodfor the identification of movement patterns. Leveraging concepts from sequential patternmining; the method takes into account the specifics of spatial movement and; in particular;the specifics of tracking data that captures indoor movement. For example; the paper'sproposal supports spatial aggregation and utilizes the topology of indoor spaces to achievebetter performance.

SWORS: a system for the efficient retrieval of relevant spatial web objects,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Jun Jie Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Nhan-Tue Phan; Dingming Wu,Abstract Spatial web objects that possess both a geographical location and a textualdescription are gaining in prevalence. This gives prominence to spatial keyword queries thatexploit both location and textual arguments. Such queries are used in many web servicessuch as yellow pages and maps services. We present SWORS; the Spatial Web ObjectRetrieval System; that is capable of efficiently retrieving spatial web objects that satisfyspatial keyword queries. Specifically; SWORS supports two types of queries: a) the location-aware top-k text retrieval (LkT) query that retrieves k individual spatial web objects takinginto account query location proximity and text relevancy; b) the spatial keyword group (SKG)query that retrieves a group of objects that cover the query keywords and are nearest to thequery location and have the shortest inter-object distances.

Efficient cost-based tracking of scheduled vehicle journeys,Dalia Tiešyte; Christian S Jensen,Applications in areas such as logistics; cargo delivery; and collective transport involve themanagement of fleets of vehicles that are expected to travel along known routes accordingto schedules. There is a fundamental need by the infrastructure surrounding the vehicles toknow the actual status of the vehicles. Since the vehicles deviate from their schedules due toroad construction; accidents; and other unexpected conditions; it is necessary for thevehicles to communicate with the infrastructure. Frequent updates introduce highcommunication costs; and server-side updates easily become a bottleneck. This paperpresents techniques that enable the tracking of vehicle positions and arrival times atscheduled stops with little communication; while still offering the desired accuracy to theinfrastructure of the status of the vehicles.

Enabling time-dependent uncertain eco-weights for road networks,Jilin Hu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen; Yu Ma,Abstract Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation is an essentialpart of the efforts to prevent global warming and climate change. Eco-routing; which enablesdrivers to use the most environmentally friendly routes; is able to substantially reduce GHGemissions from vehicular transportation. The foundation of eco-routing is a weighted-graphrepresentation of a road network in which road segments; or edges; are associated with eco-weights that capture the GHG emissions caused by traversing the edges. Due to thedynamics of traffic; the eco-weights are best modeled as being time dependent anduncertain. We formalize the problem of assigning a time-dependent; uncertain eco-weight toeach edge in a road network based on historical GPS records. In particular; a sequence ofhistograms is employed to describe the uncertain eco-weight of an edge at different time …,GeoInformatica,2017,11
Integrating non-spatial preferences into spatial location queries,Qiang Qu; Siyuan Liu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Increasing volumes of geo-referenced data are becoming available.

We proposeand study the efficient implementation of a new kind of query on points of interest that takesinto account both the locations and properties of the points of interest. The query takes aresult cardinality; a spatial range; and property-related preferences as parameters; and itreturns a compact set of points of interest with the given cardinality and in the given rangethat satisfies the preferences. Specifically; the points of interest in the result set cover so-called allying preferences and are located far from points of interest that possess so-calledalienating preferences.

Multi-cost optimal route planning under time-varying uncertainty,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Manohar Kaul; Shuo Shang,Abstract—Different uses of a road network call for the consideration of different travel costs:in route planning; travel time and distance are typically considered; and green house gas(GHG) emissions are increasingly being considered. Further; costs such as travel time andGHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses; we proposetechniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost; time-dependent; uncertain graph(MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the roadnetwork. Based on the MTUG; we define optimal routes that consider multiple costs andtimedependent uncertainty; and we propose efficient algorithms to retrieve optimal routes fora given source-destination pair and a start time.

Withthe introduction of geopositioned mobile devices such as smartphones and mappingservices such as Google Maps; the retrieval of PoIs relevant to a user's intent has became aproblem of automated spatio-textual information retrieval. Over the last several years;substantial research has gone into the invention of functionality and efficientimplementations for retrieving nearby PoIs.

Efficient vessel tracking with accuracy guarantees,Martin Redoutey; Eric Scotti; Christian Jensen; Cyril Ray; Christophe Claramunt,Abstract Safety and security are top concerns in maritime navigation; particularly as maritimetraffic continues to grow and as crew sizes are reduced. The Automatic Identification System(AIS) plays a key role in regard to these concerns. This system; whose objective is in part toidentify and locate vessels; transmits location-related information from vessels to groundstations that are part of a so-called Vessel Traffic Service (VTS); thus enabling these to trackthe movements of the vessels. This paper presents techniques that improve the existing AISby offering better and guaranteed tracking accuracies at lower communication costs. Thetechniques employ movement predictions that are shared between vessels and the VTS.Empirical studies with a prototype implementation and real vessel data demonstrate that thetechniques are capable of significantly improving the AIS.,International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,2008,11

Supporting access to previous database states requires largequantities of data and necessitates efficient temporal query processing techniques.Previously; we presented a log based storage structure and algorithms for the differentialcomputation of previous database states. Timeslices-ie; previous database states-arecomputed by traversing a log of database changes; using previously computed and cachedtimeslices as outsets. When computing a new timeslice; the cache will contain two candidateoutsets: an earlier outset and a later outset. The new timeslice can be computed by eitherincrementally updating the earlier outset or decrementally" downdating" the later outsetusing the log. The cost of this computation is determined by the size of the log between …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1998,11

Clinical data warehousing will become very important in the near future; as healthcareenterprises need to gain more information from their clinical; administrative; and nancialdata; in order to improve quality and reduce costs. Adoption of data warehousing in healthcare has been slowed by lack of understanding of the bene ts o ered by the technology.

Overview of the Special Section on Temporal Database Infrastructure,Richard T Snodgrass,The area of temporal databases has been active for the last fteen years; with a corpusnearing 800 papers. Most applications need to store time-varying data; yet there are nowidely used commercial temporal databases. A primary reason for the absence oftechnology transfer from research to practice is the lack of a commonly accepted consensusdata model or query language. Even the terminology is inconsistent.,SIGMOD Record,1994,11
Sequenced semantics,Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,10
Temporal aggregation,Johann Gamper; Michael Böhlen; Christian S Jensen,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R).

If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,10
Collaborative spatial data sharing among mobile lightweight devices,Zhiyong Huang; Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Mobile devices are increasingly being equipped with wireless peer-to-peer (P2P)networking interfaces; rendering the sharing of data among mobile devices feasible andbeneficial. In comparison to the traditional client/server wireless channel; the P2P channelshave considerably higher bandwidth. Motivated by these observations; we propose acollaborative spatial data sharing scheme that exploits the P2P capabilities of mobiledevices. Using carefully maintained routing tables; this scheme enables mobile devices notonly to use their local storage for query processing; but also to collaborate with nearbymobile peers to exploit their data. This scheme is capable of reducing the cost of thecommunication between mobile clients and the server as well as the query response time.The paper details the design of the data sharing scheme; including its routing table …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,10
Expiration times for data management,Albrecht Schmidt; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Saltenis,This paper describes an approach to incorporating the notion of expiration time into datamanagement based on the relational model. Expiration times indicate when tuples cease tobe current in a database. The paper presents a formal data model and a query algebra thathandle expiration times transparently and declaratively. In particular; expiration times areexposed to users only on insertion and update; and when triggers fire due to the expirationof a tuple; for queries; they are handled behind the scenes and do not concern the user.Notably; tuples are removed automatically from (materialised) query results as they expire inthe (base) relations. For application developers; the benefits of using expiration times areleaner application code; lower transaction volume; smaller databases; and higherconsistency for replicated data with lower overhead. Expiration times turn out to be …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,10
Extending UML for Space-and Time-Dependent Applications.,Rosanne Price; Nectaria Tryfona; Christian S Jensen,In recent years; the need for a temporal dimension in traditional spatial information systemsand for high-level models useful for the conceptual design of the resulting spatiotemporalsystems has become clear. Although having in common a need to manage spatial data andtheir changes over time; various spatiotemporal applications may manage different types ofspatiotemporal data and may be based on very different models of space; time; and change.For example; the term spatiotemporal data is used to refer both to temporal changes inspatial extents; such as redrawing the boundaries of a voting precinct or land deed; and tochanges in the value of thematic (ie; alphanumeric) data across time or space; such asvariation in soil acidity measurements depending on the measurement location and date.

Sharing-aware horizontal partitioning for exploiting correlations during query processing,Kostas Tzoumas; Amol Deshpande; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Optimization of join queries based on average selectivities is suboptimal in highlycorrelated databases. In such databases; relations are naturally divided into partitions; eachpartition having substantially different statistical characteristics. It is very compelling todiscover such data partitions during query optimization and create multiple plans for a givenquery; one plan being optimal for a particular combination of data partitions. This scenariocalls for the sharing of state among plans; so that common intermediate results are notrecomputed. We study this problem in a setting with a routing-based query execution enginebased on eddies [1]. Eddies naturally encapsulate horizontal partitioning and maximal statesharing across multiple plans.

Searching trajectories by regions of interest,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Christian S Jensen; Ji-Rong Wen; Panos Kalnis,With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search isincreasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel query type named trajectorysearch by regions of interest (TSR query). Given an argument set of trajectories; a TSRquery takes a set of regions of interest as a parameter and returns the trajectory in theargument set with the highest spatial-density correlation to the query regions. This type ofquery is useful in many popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation;and location based services in general. TSR query processing faces three challenges: howto model the spatial-density correlation between query regions and data trajectories; how toeffectively prune the search space; and how to effectively schedule multiple so-called querysources.

Finding shortest paths on terrains by killing two birds with one stone,Manohar Kaul; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the increasing availability of terrain data; eg; from aerial laser scans; themanagement of such data is attracting increasing attention in both industry and academia. Inparticular; spatial queries; eg; k-nearest neighbor and reverse nearest neighbor queries; inEuclidean and spatial network spaces are being extended to terrains. Such queries all relyon an important operation; that of finding shortest surface distances. However; shortestsurface distance computation is very time consuming. We propose techniques that enableefficient computation of lower and upper bounds of the shortest surface distance; whichenable faster query processing by eliminating expensive distance computations. Empiricalstudies show that our bounds are much tighter than the best-known bounds in many casesand that they enable speedups of up to 43 times for some well-known spatial queries.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,8

A productprovider may wish to upgrade uncompetitive products to become competitive; but wants totake into account the upgrading cost. We study the top-k product upgrading problem. Givena set P of competitor products; a set T of products that are candidates for upgrade; and anupgrading cost function f that applies to T; the problem is to return the k products in T thatcan be upgraded to not be dominated by any products in P at the lowest cost. This problemis non-trivial due to not only the large data set sizes; but also to the many possibilities forupgrading a product. We identify and provide solutions for the different options for …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,8
A moving-object index for efficient query processing with peer-wise location privacy,Dan Lin; Christian S Jensen; Rui Zhang; Lu Xiao; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract With the growing use of location-based services; location privacy attracts increasingattention from users; industry; and the research community. While considerable effort hasbeen devoted to inventing techniques that prevent service providers from knowing a user'sexact location; relatively little attention has been paid to enabling so-called peer-wiseprivacy---the protection of a user's location from unauthorized peer users. This paperidentifies an important efficiency problem in existing peer-privacy approaches that simplyapply a filtering step to identify users that are located in a query range; but that do not wantto disclose their location to the querying peer. To solve this problem; we propose a novel;privacy-policy enabled index called the PEB-tree that seamlessly integrates locationproximity and policy compatibility. We propose efficient algorithms that use the PEB-tree …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,8

Now in temporal databases,Curtis E Dyreson; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The simplest way to incorporate unknown values into the relational model; is to allowvariables; in addition to constants; as entries in the columns of relations. Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants. A table T then represents the set of relations;denoted rep (T); defined as {v (T): v is a valuation}. Then the certain answer to a query q on atable T; denoted sure (q; T) is the set of tuples that occur in every answer obtained byapplying the query to every database in rep (T). In other words; the certain answer to q on …,*,2009,8
Ranking music data by relevance and importance,Maria M Ruxanda; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Christian S Jensen; Yannis Manolopoulos,Due to the rapidly increasing availability of audio files on the Web; it is relevant to augmentsearch engines with advanced audio search functionality. In this context; the ranking of theretrieved music is an important issue. This paper proposes a music ranking method capableof flexibly fusing the music based on its relevance and importance. The fusion is controlledby a single parameter; which can be intuitively tuned by the user. The notion of authoritativemusic among relevant music is introduced; and social media mined from the Web is used inan innovative manner to determine both the relevance and importance of music. Theproposed method may support users with diverse needs when searching for music.,Multimedia and Expo; 2008 IEEE International Conference on,2008,8

Persistent views—A mechanism for managing ageing data,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Enabled by the continued advances in storage technologies; the amounts of on-linedata grow at a rapidly increasing pace. This development is witnessed in many datawarehouse-type applications; including so-called data webhouses that accumulate clickstreams from portals. The presence of very large and continuously growing amounts of dataintroduces new challenges; one of them being the need for effective management of ageddata. In very large and growing databases; some data eventually becomes inaccurate oroutdated and may be of reduced interest to the database applications. This paper offers amechanism; termed persistent views; that aids in flexibly reducing the volume of data; forexample; by enabling the replacement of such 'low-interest'; detailed data with aggregateddata. The paper motivates persistent views and precisely defines and contrasts these with …,The Computer Journal,2002,8
Efficient conversion between temporal granularities,Hong Lin,Abstract A temporal granularity is a unit of measuring time; eg; second; day; week. Agranularity graph is a directed graph showing the relationship among the granularities.Efficiently and correctly converting time values within the granularity graph is critical forsupporting multiple time granularities in an application program or a database managementsystem. The research involves finding an optimally efficient path in the granularity graph forany pair of granularities and developing an algorithm to perform the conversion operationbetween the two granularities for anchored time related values; to correctly convert agranule from a specified granularity to another granularity. The research also evaluatesseveral strategies to improve the performance of temporal operations at mixed granularities.,*,1997,8

Finding Frequently Visited Indoor POIs Using Symbolic Indoor Tracking Data.,Hua Lu; Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT Indoor tracking data is being amassed due to the deployment of indoorpositioning technologies. Analysing such data discloses useful insights that are otherwisehard to obtain. For example; by studying tracking data from an airport; we can identify theshops and restaurants that are most popular among passengers. In this paper; we study twoquery types for finding frequently visited Points of Interest (POIs) from symbolic indoortracking data. The snapshot query finds those POIs that were most frequently visited at agiven time point; whereas the interval query finds such POIs for a given time interval. Atypical example of symbolic tracking is RFID-based tracking; where an object with an RFIDtag is detected by an RFID reader when the object is in the reader's detection range.

Efficient and accurate path cost estimation using trajectory data,Jian Dai; Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: Using the growing volumes of vehicle trajectory data; it becomes increasinglypossible to capture time-varying and uncertain travel costs in a road network; includingtravel time and fuel consumption. The current paradigm represents a road network as agraph; assigns weights to the graph's edges by fragmenting trajectories into small piecesthat fit the underlying edges; and then applies a routing algorithm to the resulting graph. Wepropose a new paradigm that targets more accurate and more efficient estimation of thecosts of paths by associating weights with sub-paths in the road network. The paperprovides a solution to a foundational problem in this paradigm; namely that of computing thetime-varying cost distribution of a path. The solution consists of several steps. We first learn aset of random variables that capture the joint distributions of sub-paths that are covered …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.02886,2015,7
A clustering approach to the discovery of points of interest from geo-tagged microblog posts,Anders Skovsgaard; Christian S Jensen,Points of interest (PoI) data serves an important role as a foundation for a wide variety oflocation-based services. Such data is typically obtained from an authoritative source or fromusers through crowd sourcing. It can be costly to maintain an up-to-date authoritative source;and data obtained from users can vary greatly in coverage and quality. We are alsowitnessing a proliferation of both GPS-enabled mobile devices and geotagged contentgenerated by users of such devices. This state of affairs motivates the paper's proposal oftechniques for the automatic discovery of PoI data from geo-tagged microblog posts.Specifically; the paper proposes a new clustering technique that takes into account both thespatial and textual attributes of microblog posts to obtain clusters that represent PoIs.

Vacuuming temporal databases,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A wide range of real-world database applications; including financial and medicalapplications; are faced with accountability and trace-ability requirements. Theserequirements lead to the replacement of the usual update-in-place policy by an append-onlypolicy; yielding so-called transaction-time databases. With logical deletions beingimplemented as insertions at the physical level; these databases retain all previously currentstates and are ever-growing. A variety of physical storage structures and indexingtechniques as well as query languages have been proposed for transaction-time databases;but the support for physical deletion; termed vacuuming; has received precious littleattention. Such vacuuming is called for by; eg; the laws of many countries. Althoughnecessary; with vacuuming; the database's previously perfect and reliable recollection of …,History,1998,7

In contrast; we define and offersolutions to why-not questions on MPRQ. Given an original metric probabilistic range queryand a why-not set W of uncertain objects that are absent from the query result; a why-notquestion on MPRQ explains why the uncertain objects in W do not appear in the queryresult; and provides refinements of the original query and/or W with the minimal penalty; sothat the uncertain objects in W appear in the result of the refined query. Specifically; wepropose a framework that consists of three efficient solutions; one that modifies the originalquery; one that modifies the why-not set; and one that modifies both the original query …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,6
iPark: Identifying parking spaces from trajectories,Bin Yang; Nicolas Fantini; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A wide variety of desktop and mobile Web applications involve geo-tagged content;eg; photos and (micro-) blog postings. Such content; often called User Generated Geo-Content (UGGC); plays an increasingly important role in many applications. However; agreat demand also exists for" core" UGGC where the geo-spatial aspect is not just a tag onother content; but is the primary content; eg; a city street map with up-to-date roadconstruction data. Along these lines; the iPark system aims to turn volumes of GPS dataobtained from vehicles into information about the locations of parking spaces; thus enablingeffective parking search applications. In particular; we demonstrate how iPark helps ordinaryusers annotate an existing digital map with two types of parking; on-street parking andparking zones; based on vehicular tracking data.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,6
Towards location-based access control in healthcare emergency response,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Michael Kirkpatrick; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Recent advances in positioning and tracking technologies have led to theemergence of novel location-based applications that allow participants to access informationrelevant to their spatio-temporal context. Traditional access control models; such as role-based access control (RBAC); are not sufficient to address the new challenges introducedby these location-based applications. Several recent research efforts have enhanced RBACwith spatio-temporal features. Nevertheless; the state-of-the-art does not deal with mobility ofboth subjects and objects and does not support the utilization of complex access controldecisions based on spatio-temporal relationships among subjects and objects. Furthermore;such relationships change frequently in dynamic environments; requiring efficientmechanisms to monitor and re-evaluate access control decisions.

TransDB: GPS data management with applications in collective transport,Christian S Jensen; Dalia Tiešytė,Abstract Recent and continuing advances in geo-positioning; mobile communications; andcomputing electronics combine to offer opportunities for advanced and affordable collectivetransport services. As the roads in many parts of the world are facing increasing congestion;it becomes increasingly important to establish collective transport solutions; such as busservices; that are competitive in comparison to the use of private cars. One importantingredient in the provisioning of such solutions is an information system that is always awareof the current location and expected future locations of each bus and that is capable ofutilizing this information in real time as well as off-line; eg; for offering the users accuratearrival information and for creating safe; realistic; and environmentally friendly busschedules.

Challenges in the tracking and prediction of scheduled-vehicle journeys,Dalia Tiesyte; Christian S Jensen,A number of applications in areas such as logistics; cargo delivery; and collective transportinvolve the management of fleets of vehicles that are expected to travel along known routesaccording to fixed schedules. Due to road construction; accidents; and other unanticipatedconditions; the vehicles deviate from their schedules. At the same time; there is a need forthe infrastructure surrounding the vehicles to continually know the actual status of thevehicles. For example; anticipated arrival times of buses may have to be displayed at busstops. It is a fundamental challenge to maintain this type of knowledge with minimal cost.This paper characterizes the problem of real-time vehicle tracking using wirelesscommunication; and of predicting the future status of the vehicles when their movements arerestricted to given routes and when they follow schedules with the best effort.

An algebraic framework for temporal attribute characteristics,Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Most real-world database applications manage temporal data; ie; data with associated timereferences that capture a temporal aspect of the data; typically either when the data is validor when the data is known. Such applications abound in; eg; the financial; medical; andscientific domains. In contrast to this; current database management systems offer preciouslylittle built-in query language support for temporal data management. This situation persistsalthough an active temporal database research community has demonstrated thatapplication development can be simplified substantially by built-in temporal support. Thispaper's contribution is motivated by the observation that existing temporal data models andquery languages generally make the same rigid assumption about the semantics of theassociation of data and time; namely that if a subset of the time domain is associated with …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2006,6
Efficient Similarity Retrieval In Music Databases.,Maria M Ruxanda; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Audio music is increasingly becoming available in digital form; and the digital musiccollections of individuals continue to grow. Addressing the need for effective means ofretrieving music from such collections; this paper proposes new techniques for contentbasedsimilarity search. Each music object is modeled as a time sequence of high-dimensionalfeature vectors; and dynamic time warping (DTW) is used as the similarity measure. Toaccomplish this; the paper extends techniques for time-series-length reduction and lowerbounding of DTW distance to the multidimensional case. Further; the Vector Approximationfile is adapted to the indexing of time sequences and to use a lower bound on the DTWdistance. Using these techniques; the paper exploits the lack of a ground truth for queries toefficiently compute query results that differ only slightly from results that may be more …,COMAD,2006,6

We study a new pathfinding problem in uncertain road networks; where paths have travel cost distributions. Givena source and a destination; we find optimal; non-dominated paths connecting the sourceand the destination; where the optimality is defined in terms of the stochastic dominanceamong cost distributions of paths. We first design an A based framework that utilizes theuncertain graph to obtain the most accurate cost distributions while finding the candidatepaths. Next; we propose a three-stage dominance examination method that employsextreme values in each candidate path's cost distribution for early detection of dominated …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,5
Synthesis of partial rankings of points of interest using crowdsourcing,Ilkcan Keles; Simonas Saltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The web is increasingly being accessed from mobile devices; and studies suggestthat a large fraction of keyword-based search engine queries have local intent; meaning thatusers are interested in local content and that the underlying ranking function should take intoaccount both relevance to the query keywords and the query location. A key challenge inbeing able to make progress on the design of ranking functions is to be able to assess thequality of the results returned by ranking functions. We propose a model that synthesizes aranking of points of interest from answers to crowdsourced pairwise relevance questions. Toevaluate the model; we propose an innovative methodology that enables evaluation of thequality of synthesized rankings in a simulated setting.

Vehicle routing with user-generated trajectory data,Vaida Ceikute; Christian S Jensen,Rapidly increasing volumes of GPS data collected from vehicles provide new andincreasingly comprehensive insight into the routes that drivers prefer. While routing servicesgenerally compute shortest or fastest routes; recent studies suggest that local drivers oftenprefer routes that are neither shortest nor fastest; indicating that drivers value routeproperties that are diverse and hard to quantify or even identify. We propose a routingservice that uses an existing routing service while exploiting the availability of historicalroute usage data from local drivers. Given a source and destination; the servicerecommends a corresponding route that is most preferred by local drivers. It uses a routepreference function that takes into account the number of distinct drivers and the number oftrips associated with a route; as well as temporal aspects of the trips.

We envision a fully organic indoor positioning system; where allavailable sources of information are exploited in order to provide room-level accuracy withno active intervention of users.

Researchinto recognising and interpreting these typical expressions is mature in many languages.However; there is a class of expressions that are less typical; very varied; and difficult toautomatically interpret. These indicate dates and times; but are harder to detect becausethey often do not contain time words and are not used frequently enough to appear inconventional temporally-annotated corpora–for example Michaelmas or Vasant Panchami.Using Wikipedia and linked data; we automatically construct a resource of English namedtemporal expressions; and use it to extract training examples from a large corpus.

A comparison of the use of virtual versus physical snapshots for supporting update-intensive workloads,Darius Šidlauskas; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Deployments of networked sensors fuel online applications that feed on real-timesensor data. This scenario calls for techniques that support the management of workloadsthat contain queries as well as very frequent updates. This paper compares two well-chosenapproaches to exploiting the parallelism offered by modern processors for supporting suchworkloads. A general approach to avoiding contention among parallel hardware threadsand thus exploiting the parallelism available in processors is to maintain two copies; orsnapshots; of the data: one for the relatively long-duration queries and one for the frequentand very localized updates. The snapshot that receives the updates is frequently madeavailable to queries; so that queries see up-to-date data. The snapshots may be physical orvirtual. Physical snapshots are created using the C library memcpy function. Virtual …,Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2012,5
Effective privacy-preserving online route planning,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen,An online Route Planning Service (RPS) computes a route from one location to another.Current RPSs such as Google Maps require the use of precise locations. However; someusers may not want to disclose their source and destination locations due to privacyconcerns. An approach that supplies fake locations to an existing service incurs asubstantial loss of quality of service; and the service may well return a result that may be nothelpful to the user. We propose a solution that is able to return accurate route planningresults when source and destination regions are used in order to achieve privacy. Thesolution re-uses a standard online RPS rather than replicate this functionality; and it needsno trusted third party. The solution is able to compute the exact results without leaking of theexact locations to the RPS or un-trusted parties. In addition; we provide heuristics that …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,5
Distributed; concurrent range monitoring of spatial-network constrained mobile objects,Hua Lu; Zhiyong Huang; Christian S Jensen; Linhao Xu,Abstract The ability to continuously monitor the positions of mobile objects is important inmany applications. While most past work has been set in Euclidean spaces; the mobileobjects relevant in many applications are constrained to spatial networks. This paperaddresses the problem of range monitoring of mobile objects in this setting; in which networkdistance is concerned. An architecture is proposed where the mobile clients and a centralserver share computation; the objective being to obtain scalability by utilizing the capabilitiesof the clients. The clients issue location reports to the server; which is in charge of datastoring and query processing. The server associates each range monitoring query with thenetwork-edge portions it covers. This enables incremental maintenance of each query; and italso enables shared maintenance of concurrent queries by identifying the overlaps …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,5

Managing aging data using persistent views,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Enabled by the continued advances in storage technologies; the amounts of on-linedata grow at a rapidly increasing Pace. For example; this development is witnessed in the so-called data webhouses that accumulate data derived from clickstreams. The presence ofvery large and continuously growing amounts of data introduces new challenges; one ofthem being the need for effectively managing aging data that is perhaps inaccurate; partlyoutdated; and of reduced interest. This Paper describes a new mechanism; persistent views;that aids in flexibly reducing the volume of data; eg; by enabling the replacement of such“low-interest;” detailed data with aggregated data; and it outlines a strategy for implementingpersistent views.,International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems,2000,5

Modification semantics in now-relative databases,Kristian Torp; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract This paper defines the semantics of modifications involving the variable NOW. Morespecifically; the problems with modifications in the presence of NOW are explored;illustrating that the main problems are with modifications and tuples that reach into thefuture. The paper defines the semantics of modifications---including insertions; deletions;and updates---of databases without NOW; with NOW; and with values of the type NOW+#;where# is a non-variable time duration. To accommodate these semantics; three newtimestamp values are introduced. An approximate semantics that does not rely on newtimestamp values is also provided. Finally; implementation is explored. 167 168SEMANTICS OF TEMPORAL DATA 1 Introduction,International Journal of Information Systems,1999,5

Now,James Clifford; Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass; Tomás Isakowitz; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Now is an English noun meaning “at the present time”[Sykes 1964]. Now is also adistinguished timestamp value in many temporal data model proposals. In this chapter; wegive precise; but informal; semantics for this familiar term and discuss representations andquery language constructs for supporting now in TSQL2. We also explore the relatedconcepts of “infinite future” and “infinite past.”,*,1995,5

PACE: a PAth-CEntric paradigm for stochastic path finding,Bin Yang; Jian Dai; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Jilin Hu,Abstract With the growing volumes of vehicle trajectory data; it becomes increasinglypossible to capture time-varying and uncertain travel costs; eg; travel time; in a road network.The current paradigm for doing so is edge-centric: it represents a road network as aweighted graph and splits trajectories into small fragments that fit the underlying edges toassign time-varying and uncertain weights to edges. It then applies path finding algorithmsto the resulting; weighted graph. We propose a new PA th-CE ntric paradigm; PACE; thattargets more accurate and more efficient path cost estimation and path finding. By assigningweights to paths; PACE avoids splitting trajectories into small fragments. We solve twofundamental problems to establish the PACE paradigm:(i) how to compute accurately thetravel cost distribution of a path and (ii) how to conduct path finding for a source …,The VLDB Journal,2017,4
Clue-based spatio-textual query,Junling Liu; Ke Deng; Huanliang Sun; Yu Ge; Xiaofang Zhou; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Along with the proliferation of online digital map and location-based service; verylarge POI (point of interest) databases have been constructed where a record correspondsto a POI with information including name; category; address; geographical location andother features. A basic spatial query in POI database is POI retrieval. In many scenarios; auser cannot provide enough information to pinpoint the POI except some clue. For example;a user wants to identify a café in a city visited many years ago. SHe cannot remember thename and address but she still recalls that" the café is about 200 meters away from arestaurant; and turning left at the restaurant there is a bakery 500 meters away; etc.".Intuitively; the clue; even partial and approximate; describes the spatio-textual contextaround the targeted POI.

Read/write-optimized tree indexing for solid-state drives,Peiquan Jin; Chengcheng Yang; Christian S Jensen; Puyuan Yang; Lihua Yue,Abstract Flash-memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are used widely for secondarystorage. To be effective for SSDs; traditional indices have to be redesigned to cope with thespecial properties of flash memory; such as asymmetric read/write latencies (fast reads andslow writes) and out-of-place updates. Previous flash-optimized indices focus mainly onreducing random writes to SSDs; which is typically accomplished at the expense of asubstantial number of extra reads. However; modern SSDs show a narrowing gap betweenread and write speeds; and read operations on SSDs increasingly affect the overallperformance of indices on SSDs. As a consequence; how to optimize SSD-aware indices byreducing both write and read costs is a pertinent and open challenge. We propose a newtree index for SSDs that is able to reduce both writes and extra reads. In particular; we …,The VLDB Journal,2016,4
YASK: A why-not question answering engine for spatial keyword query services,Lei Chen; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen; Yafei Li,Abstract With the proliferation of the mobile use of the web; spatial keyword query (SKQ)services are gaining in importance.

Trajectory based optimal segment computation in road network databases,Xiaohui Li; Vaida Čeikute; Christian S Jensen; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Finding a location for a new facility st the facility attracts the maximal number ofcustomers is a challenging problem. Existing studies either model customers as static sitesand thus do not consider customer movement; or they focus on theoretical aspects and donot provide solutions that are shown empirically to be scalable. Given a road network; a setof existing facilities; and a collection of customer route traversals; an optimal segment queryreturns the optimal road network segment (s) for a new facility. We propose a practicalframework for computing this query; where each route traversal is assigned a score that isdistributed among the road segments covered by the route according to a score distributionmodel. We propose two algorithms that adopt different approaches to computing the query.Empirical studies with real data sets demonstrate that the algorithms are capable of …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,4
Cooperative scalable moving continuous query processing,Xiaohui Li; Panagiotis Karras; Lei Shi; Kian-Lee Tan; Christian S Jensen,A range of applications call for a mobile client to continuously monitor others in closeproximity. Past research on such problems has covered two extremes: It has offered totallycentralized solutions; where a server takes care of all queries; and totally distributedsolutions; in which there is no central authority at all. Unfortunately; none of these twosolutions scales to intensive moving object tracking applications; where each client poses aquery. In this paper; we formulate the moving continuous query (MCQ) problem and proposea balanced model where servers cooperatively take care of the global view and handle themajority of the workload. Meanwhile; moving clients; having basic memory and computationresources; handle small portions of the workload. This model is further enhanced bydynamic region allocation and grid size adjustment mechanisms that reduce the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,4

Nonsequenced semantics,Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The simplest way to incorporate unknown values into the relational model; is to allowvariables; in addition to constants; as entries in the columns of relations. Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants. A table T then represents the set of relations;denoted rep (T); defined as {v (T): v is a valuation}. Then the certain answer to a query q on atable T; denoted sure (q; T) is the set of tuples that occur in every answer obtained byapplying the query to every database in rep (T). In other words; the certain answer to q on …,*,2009,4

In ISA systems; it is essential to be able to position vehicles within a roadnetwork. Because digital road networks as well as GNSS positioning are often inaccurate; atechnique known as map matching is needed that aims to use this inaccurate data fordetermining a vehicle's real road-network position. Then; knowing this position; an ISAsystem can compare speed with the speed limit in effect and take measures againstspeeding. This paper presents an on-line map matching algorithm with an extensive numberof weighting parameters that allow better determination of a vehicle's road network position.The algorithm uses certainty value to express its belief in the correctness of its results …,Proceedings from the Annual Transport Conference,2007,4
CEES,Camilla Jensen,ABSTRACT The objective with this paper is to test whether there are spillovers andagglomeration effects in the Polish food; beverage and tobacco industries. But while moststudies on spillovers in developing and transition countries focus on unidirectionalspillovers; this study assumes that spillovers may be multidirectional and instead could bebased on any kind of 'community'related to a geographic cluster or industry. Transitioncountries in Eastern Europe often invite investors in with open arms and ample tax holidaysbased on the assumption that they create jobs and their technology spills over on domesticfirms' own capabilities eventually. Preliminary results on horizontal spillovers in this papershow that this is not the case in the Polish food industry.

Enhancing an Extensible Query Optimizer with Support for Multiple Equivalence Types,Giedrius Slivinskas; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Database management systems are continuously being extended with support fornew types of data and advanced querying capabilities. In large part because of this; queryoptimization has remained a very active area of research throughout the past two decades.At the same time; current commercial optimizers are hard to modify; to incorporate desiredchanges in; eg; query algebras or transformation rules. This has led to a number of researchcontributions aiming to create extensible query optimizers; such as Starburst; Volcano; andOPT++.

Efficient Differential Timeslice Computation,Kristian Torp; Leo Mark; Christian S Jensen,Transaction-time databases record all previous database states and are ever-growing;leading to potentially huge quantities of data. For that reason; efficient query processing is ofparticular importance. Due to the large size of transaction-time relations; it is advantageousto utilize cheap write-once storage media for storage. This is facilitated by adopting a log-based storage structure. Timeslices; ie; relation states or snapshots; are computed bytraversing the logs; using previously computed and cached timeslices as outsets. Whencomputing a new timeslice; the cache will contain two candidate outsets: an earlier outsetand a later outset. We provide efficient means of always picking the optimal one.Specifically; we define and investigate the use of a new data structure; the B⁺-tree-likeInsertion Tree (I-tree); for this purpose.

Finding lowest-cost paths in settings with safe and preferred zones,Saad Aljubayrin; Jianzhong Qi; Christian S Jensen; Rui Zhang; Zhen He; Yuan Li,Abstract We define and study Euclidean and spatial network variants of a new path findingproblem: given a set of safe or preferred zones with zero or low cost; find paths that minimizethe cost of travel from an origin to a destination. In this problem; the entire space is passable;with preference given to safe or preferred zones. Existing algorithms for problems thatinvolve unsafe regions to be avoided strictly are not effective for this new problem. To solvethe Euclidean variant; we devise a transformation of the continuous data space with safezones into a discrete graph upon which shortest path algorithms apply. A naivetransformation yields a large graph that is expensive to search. In contrast; ourtransformation exploits properties of hyperbolas in Euclidean space to safely eliminategraph edges; thus improving performance without affecting correctness.

Elite: an elastic infrastructure for big spatiotemporal trajectories,Xike Xie; Benjin Mei; Jinchuan Chen; Xiaoyong Du; Christian S Jensen,Abstract As the volumes of spatiotemporal trajectory data continue to grow at a rapid pace; anew generation of data management techniques is needed in order to be able to utilizethese data to provide a range of data-driven services; including geographic-type services.Key challenges posed by spatiotemporal data include the massive data volumes; the highvelocity with which the data are captured; the need for interactive response times; and theinherent inaccuracy of the data.

Effective similarity search on indoor moving-object trajectories,Peiquan Jin; Tong Cui; Qian Wang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new approach to measuring the similarity among indoormoving-object trajectories. Particularly; we propose to measure indoor trajectory similaritybased on spatial similarity and semantic pattern similarity. For spatial similarity; we proposeto detect the critical points in trajectories and then use them to determine spatial similarity.This approach can lower the computational costs of similarity search. Moreover; it helpsachieve a more effective measure of spatial similarity because it removes noisy points. Forsemantic pattern similarity; we propose to construct a hierarchical semantic pattern tocapture the semantics of trajectories. This method makes it possible to capture the implicitsemantic similarity among different semantic labels of locations; and enables moremeaningful measures of semantic similarity among indoor trajectories.

Indexing metric uncertain data for range queries,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Xinhan Li; Christian S Jensen; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Range queries in metric spaces have applications in many areas such asmultimedia retrieval; computational biology; and location-based services; where metricuncertain data exists in different forms; resulting from equipment limitations; high-throughputsequencing technologies; privacy preservation; or others. In this paper; we represent metricuncertain data by using an object-level model and a bi-level model; respectively. Two novelindexes; the uncertain pivot B+-tree (UPB-tree) and the uncertain pivot B+-forest (UPB-forest); are proposed accordingly in order to support probabilistic range queries wrt a widerange of uncertain data types and similarity metrics. Both index structures use a small set ofeffective pivots chosen based on a newly defined criterion; and employ the B+-tree (s) as theunderlying index. By design; they are easy to be integrated into any existing DBMS. In …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,3
Manycore processing of repeated range queries over massive moving objects observations,Francesco Lettich; Salvatore Orlando; Claudio Silvestri; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: The ability to timely process significant amounts of continuously updated spatialdata is mandatory for an increasing number of applications. Parallelism enables suchapplications to face this data-intensive challenge and allows the devised systems to featurelow latency and high scalability. In this paper we focus on a specific data-intensive problem;concerning the repeated processing of huge amounts of range queries over massive sets ofmoving objects; where the spatial extents of queries and objects are continuously modifiedover time. To tackle this problem and significantly accelerate query processing we devise ahybrid CPU/GPU pipeline that compresses data output and save query processing work.The devised system relies on an ad-hoc spatial index leading to a problem decompositionthat results in a set of independent data-parallel tasks.

Top-k point of interest retrieval using standard indexes,Anders Skovsgaard; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the proliferation of Internet-connected; location-aware mobile devices; such assmartphones; we are also witnessing a proliferation and increased use of map-basedservices that serve information about relevant Points of Interest (PoIs) to their users. Weprovide an efficient and practical foundation for the processing of queries that take akeyword and a spatial region as arguments and return the k most relevant PoIs that belongto the region; which may be the part of the map covered by the user's screen. The paperproposes a novel technique that encodes the spatio-textual part of a PoI as a compact bitstring. This technique extends an existing spatial encoding to also encode the textual aspectof a PoI in compressed form.

Data management on the spatial web,Christian S Jensen,Abstract Due in part to the increasing mobile use of the web and the proliferation of geo-positioning; the web is fast acquiring a significant spatial aspect. Content and users arebeing augmented with locations that are used increasingly by location-based services.Studies suggest that each week; several billion web queries are issued that have local intentand target spatial web objects. These are points of interest with a web presence; and theythus have locations as well as textual descriptions. This development has given prominenceto spatial web data management; an area ripe with new and exciting opportunities andchallenges. The research community has embarked on inventing and supporting new queryfunctionality for the spatial web. Different kinds of spatial web queries return objects that arenear a location argument and are relevant to a text argument. To support such queries; it …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,3

Snapshot equivalence,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

An LBS is a service that provides location-based informationto mobile users. A key idea is to provide a service that is dependent on positionalinformation associated with the user; most importantly the user's current location. Theservices may also be dependent on other factors; such as the personal preferences andinterests of the user [3]. Examples of LBSs abound. A service might inform its users abouttraffic jams and weather situations that are expected to be of relevance to each user. A friendmonitor may inform each user about the current whereabouts of nearby friends. Otherservices may track the positions of emergency vehicles; police cars; security personnel …,*,2007,3
Efficient management of short-lived data,Albrecht Schmidt; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: Motivated by the increasing prominence of loosely-coupled systems; such asmobile and sensor networks; which are characterised by intermittent connectivity andvolatile data; we study the tagging of data with so-called expiration times. More specifically;when data are inserted into a database; they may be tagged with time values indicatingwhen they expire; ie; when they are regarded as stale or invalid and thus are no longerconsidered part of the database. In a number of applications; expiration times are knownand can be assigned at insertion time. We present data structures and algorithms for onlinemanagement of data tagged with expiration times. The algorithms are based on fullyfunctional; persistent treaps; which are a combination of binary search trees with respect to aprimary attribute and heaps with respect to a secondary attribute.

This is done by maintaining a dynamic; distributed database. Thus; by capturingpertinent aspects of reality in digital form—in semantically rich and appropriately organizedstructures; and with powerful update and retrieval techniques available—an ideal foundationfor delivering a wide range of services is obtained. The envisioned database has beentermed a “digital mirror of reality.” This phrase is intuitive and paints the right mental picture;but it only partially reflects the desirable capabilities of this database. For example; thedatabase may capture past states of reality and one or more perceived future states; inaddition to the current state.

Towards a Data Consistency Modeling and Testing Framework for MOF Defined Languages,Jan Pettersen Nytun; Christian S Jensen; Vladimir A Oleshchuk,Abstract The number of online data sources is continuously increasing; and related data areoften available from several sources. However accessing data from multiple sources ishindered by the use of different languages and schemas at the sources; as well as byinconsistencies among the data. There is thus a growing need for tools that enable thetesting of consistency among data from different sources. This paper puts forward theconcept of a framework; that supports the integration of UML models and ontologies writtenin languages such as the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL). The framework will bebased on the Meta Object Facility (MOF); a MOF metamodel (eg a metamodel for OWL) canbe input as a specification; the framework will then allow the user to instantiate the specifiedmetamodel.,Norsk informatikkonferanse NIK,2003,3

Continued advances in hardware technologies combine to create a new class ofinformation services; termed mobile e-services; or simply m-services; which exploits theadvances in; among others; wireless communications; positioning; and miniaturization.Because the users do not merely interact with the services from behind stationary desktopcomputers; but from a variety of increasingly unobtrusive information appliances while onthe move; location information plays a fundamental role; and new types of services becomeof interest. Such services include tracking; way-finding; traffic management; safety-relatedservices; and mixed-reality games; to name but a few. Data warehousing has the potentialfor playing an essential part in m-services. However; for data warehousing to be successfulin an m-service scenario; new challenges must be met by data warehousing technologies …,Datenbank Rundbrief,2001,3

The Surrogate Data Type,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,For this reason; a SURROGATE data type cannot be treated identically to how other data typesare treated. For example; at tuple cannot be assigned a specific value for a SURROGATEattribute. Rather; the user must indicate that the value to be assigned must be a new value neverused before; or; alternatively; must indicate some SURROGATE attribute of some tuple that theassigned value must be identical to … For example; if surrogates are used for the identificationof employees and a new tuple with information about an existing employee is to be entered thenit is specified that the surrogate of the new tuple is to be identical to that of the existingtuple(s) for the particular employee … Beyond the semantics just mentioned; it is the responsibilityof the user to give meaning to surrogates. For example; the user may; or may not; use attributesof SURROGATE type as keys … RT Snodgrass (ed.); The TSQL2 Temporal Query …,*,1995,3
Vacuuming in TSQL2,Christian S Jensen,Abstract Updates; including (logical) deletions; to temporal tables that support transactiontime result in insertions at the physical level. Despite the continuing decrease in cost of datastorage; it is still; for various reasons; not always acceptable that all data be retained forever.Therefore; there is a need for a new mechanism for the vacuuming; ie; physical deletion; ofdata when such tables are being managed. We propose syntax and informal semantics forvacuuming of data from temporal tables in TSQL2 which support transaction time. Themechanism allows—at schema definition time; as well as later; during the life span of a table—for the specification of so-called cut-off points. A cut-off point for a table is a timestamp thatevaluates to a time instant. The timestamp may be either absolute or a bound or unboundnow-relative timestamp. Conceptually; the cut-off point indicates that all data; current in …,*,1994,3

Risk-aware path selection with time-varying; uncertain travel costs: a time series approach,Jilin Hu; Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract We address the problem of choosing the best paths among a set of candidate pathsbetween the same origin–destination pair. This functionality is used extensively whenconstructing origin–destination matrices in logistics and flex transportation. Because the costof a path; eg; travel time; varies over time and is uncertain; there is generally no single bestpath. We partition time into intervals and represent the cost of a path during an interval as arandom variable; resulting in an uncertain time series for each path. When facinguncertainties; users generally have different risk preferences; eg; risk-loving or risk-averse;and thus prefer different paths. We develop techniques that; for each time interval; are ableto find paths with non-dominated lowest costs while taking the users' risk preferences intoaccount. We represent risk by means of utility function categories and show how the use …,The VLDB Journal,2018,2
Trajectory similarity join in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The matching of similar pairs of objects; called similarity join; is fundamentalfunctionality in data management. We consider the case of trajectory similarity join (TS-Join);where the objects are trajectories of vehicles moving in road networks. Thus; given two setsof trajectories and a threshold θ; the TS-Join returns all pairs of trajectories from the two setswith similarity above θ. This join targets applications such as trajectory near-duplicatedetection; data cleaning; ridesharing recommendation; and traffic congestion prediction.With these applications in mind; we provide a purposeful definition of similarity. To enableefficient TS-Join processing on large sets of trajectories; we develop search space pruningtechniques and take into account the parallel processing capabilities of modern processors.Specifically; we present a two-phase divide-and-conquer algorithm. For each trajectory …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,2
Reverse top-k geo-social keyword queries in road networks,Jingwen Zhao; Yunjun Gao; Gang Chen; Christian S Jensen; Rui Chen; Deng Cai,Identifying prospective customers is an important aspect of marketing research. In this paper;we provide support for a new type of query; the Reverse Top-k Geo-Social Keyword(RkGSK) query. This query takes into account spatial; textual; and social information; andfinds prospective customers for geotagged objects. As an example; a restaurant managermight apply the query to find prospective customers. To address this; we propose a hybridindex; the GIM-tree; which indexes locations; keywords; and social information of geo-tagged users and objects; and then; using the GIM-tree; we present efficient RkGSK queryprocessing algorithms that exploit several pruning strategies. The effectiveness of RkGSKretrieval is characterized via a case study; and extensive experiments using real datasetsoffer insight into the efficiency of the proposed index and algorithms.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,2
Extending the kernel of a relational dbms with comprehensive support for sequenced temporal queries,Anton Dignös; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Many databases contain temporal; or time-referenced; data and use intervals tocapture the temporal aspect. While SQL-based database management systems (DBMSs)are capable of supporting the management of interval data; the support they offer can beimproved considerably. A range of proposed temporal data models and query languagesoffer ample evidence to this effect. Natural queries that are very difficult to formulate in SQLare easy to formulate in these temporal query languages. The increased focus on analyticsover historical data where queries are generally more complex exacerbates the difficultiesand thus the potential benefits of a temporal query language. Commercial DBMSs haverecently started to offer limited temporal functionality in a step-by-step manner; focusing onthe representation of intervals and neglecting the implementation of the query evaluation …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,2
Efficient in-memory indexing of network-constrained trajectories,Benjamin Krogh; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp,Abstract With the decreasing cost and growing size of main memory; it is increasinglyrelevant to utilize main-memory indexing for efficient query processing. We propose SPNET;which we believe is the first in-memory index for network-constrained trajectory data. Toexploit the main-memory setting SPNET exploits efficient shortest-path compression oftrajectories to achieve a compact index structure. SPNET is capable of exploiting the parallelcomputing capabilities of modern machines and supports both intra-and inter-queryparallelism. The former improves response time; and the latter improves throughput. Bydesign; SPNET supports a wider range of query types than any single existing index. Anexperimental study in a real-world setting with 1.94 billion GPS records and nearly 4 milliontrajectories in a road network with 1.8 million edges indicates that SPNET typically offers …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,2
Concise caching of driving instructions,Jeppe Rishede Thomsen; Man Lung Yiu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Online driving direction services offer fundamental functionality to mobile users; andsuch services see substantial and increasing loads as mobile access continues toproliferate. Cache servers can be deployed in order to reduce the resulting network traffic.We define so-called concise shortest paths that are equivalent to driving instructions. Aconcise shortest path occupies much less space than a shortest path; yet it providessufficient navigation information to mobile users. Then we propose techniques that enablethe caching of concise shortest paths in order to improve the cache hit ratio. Interestingly; theuse of concise shortest paths in caching has two opposite effects on the cache hit ratio. Thecache can accommodate a larger number of concise paths; but each individual concise pathcontains fewer nodes and so may answer fewer shortest path queries. The challenge is to …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,2
Spatial keyword querying of geo-tagged web content,Christian S Jensen,Abstract The web is increasingly being used by mobile users; and it is increasingly possibleto accurately geo-position mobile users. In addition; increasing volumes of geo-tagged webcontent are becoming available. Further; indications are that a substantial fraction of webkeyword queries target local content. When combined; these observations suggest thatspatial keyword querying is important and indeed gaining in importance. A prototypicalspatial keyword query takes a user location and user-supplied keywords as parameters andreturns web content that is spatially and textually relevant to these parameters. The paperreviews key concepts related to spatial keyword querying and reviews recent proposals bythe author and his colleagues for spatial keyword querying functionality that is easy to use;relevant to users; and can be supported efficiently.,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Ranking in Databases,2013,2
Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks--Extended Version,Bin Yang; Manohar Kaul; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: We are witnessing increasing interests in the effective use of road networks. Forexample; to enable effective vehicle routing; weighted-graph models of transportationnetworks are used; where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated withtraversing the edge; eg; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a preconditionto using a graph model for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture traveltimes and GHG emissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from thenetwork. However; GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weightsto all edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in aroad network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover onlya small fraction of the edges; each with an associated ground-truth travel cost.

Further; it is increasinglypossible to accurately geo-position mobile devices; and increasing volumes of geo-positioned content; eg; Web pages; business directory entries; and microblog posts; arebecoming available on the Web. In short; an increasingly mobile and spatial Web is fastemerging. This development enables Web queries with local intent; ie; keyword-basedqueries issued by users who are looking for Web content near them. In addition; it implies anincreasing demand for query functionality that supports local intent.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,2

The great indoors: A data management frontier,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu,Much of the research on data management for moving objects has assumed an outdoorsetting in which objects move in Euclidean space (possibly constrained) or some form ofspatial network and in which GPS or GPS-like positioning is assumed explicitly or implicitly.That body of research provides part of an enabling foundation for the growing Location-Based Services industry. However; we lead large parts of our lives in indoor spaces: homes;office buildings; shopping and leisure facilities; and collective transportation infrastructures.The latter may be large: For example; each day in 2009; London Heathrow Airport; UK hadon average 180;000 passengers; and the Tokyo Subway (Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway);Japan delivered a daily average of 8.7 million passenger rides in 2008.

Flexible fusion of relevance and importance in music ranking,Maria M Ruxanda; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Due to the proliferation of audio files on the Web and in large digital musiccollections; the ranking of the retrieved music becomes an important issue in MusicInformation Retrieval. This paper proposes a music-ranking strategy that can identify andflexibly fuse music audio; ranging from similar and potentially serendipitous music toauthoritative or mainstream music. The notions of similar and authoritative music are double-folded identified based on user preference data and acoustic features extracted from theaudio. The music-ranking employs kernel functions; which can be user-controllable throughan intuitive parameter tuning. A research prototype system that incorporates the rankingmechanism is developed; and a user study is conducted on its use. The results of the surveyenvisage users' satisfaction with respect to the proposed music-ranking strategy; and its …,Journal of New Music Research,2010,2

Algorithmic strategies for adapting 802.11 location fingerprinting to environmental changes,René Hansen; Rico Wind; Christian S Jensen; Bent Thomsen,1 Summary This paper studies novel algorithmic strategies that enable 802.11 locationfingerprinting to adapt to environmental changes. A long-standing challenge in locationfingerprinting has been that dynamic changes; such as people presence; opening/closing ofdoors; or changing humidity levels; may influence the 802.11 signal strengths to an extentwhere a static radio map is rendered useless. To counter this effect; related research effortspropose to install additional sensors in order to adapt a previously built radio map to thecircumstances at a given time. Although effective; this is not a viable solution for ubiquitouspositioning where localization is required in many different buildings. Instead; we proposealgorithmic strategies for dealing with changing environmental dynamics. We haveperformed an evaluation of our algorithms on signal strength data collected over a two …,International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation,2010,2
SQL-based temporal query languages,Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,2

Temporal compatibility,Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,2
Seamless indoor/outdoor positioning with streamspin,René Hansen; Christian S Jensen; Bent Thomsen; Rico Wind,Abstract This paper presents the implementation of novel seamless indoor/outdoorpositioning service for mobile users. When users are not within GPS range; the serviceexploits the wifi access point infrastructure for positioning. A central server stores wifi radiomaps and map images that are then sent to user terminals based on the mac addresses ofnearby access points. The positioning services is available in Streamspin (www. streamspin.com); which is an open and scalable platform for the creation and delivery of location-basedservices.

Indeed; temporal aggregation is complex and among the most difficult; andthus interesting; temporal functionality to support.

A reinforcement learning approach for adaptive query processing,Kostas Tzoumas; Timos Sellis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract In adaptive query processing; query plans are improved at runtime by means offeedback. In the very flexible approach based on so-called eddies; query execution istreated as a process of routing tuples to the query operators that combine to compute aquery. This makes it possible to alter query plans at the granularity of tuples. Further; thecomplex task of searching the query plan space for a suitable plan now resides in therouting policies used. These policies must adapt to the changing execution environment andmust converge at a near-optimal plan when the environment stabilizes. This paper advancesadaptive query processing in two respects. First; it proposes a general framework for therouting problem that may serve the same role for adaptive query processing as does theframework of search in query plan space for conventional query processing.

Starting from there; we first tried toidentify reasons why this is the case. Our approach to doing so was to first collect anddiscuss sample scenarios for mobile applications and their characteristics. We then sharedour experiences in developing applications for some of these scenarios. We quickly realizedthat the term “mobile applications” covers an area that is too broad to come up with anycommon characteristics for all the different application domains and scenarios. Therefore;we decided to concentrate on applications supporting mobile users (in contrast to; egapplications where exclusively or primarily the code is mobile or applications with no humanuser).

Dimensional modeling by using a new response to slowly changing dimensions,Lars Frank; Christian Frank; Christian Søndergaard Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract: Dimensions are defined as dynamic or slowly changing if the attributes orrelationships of a dimension can be updated. Aggregations to dynamic dimensions might bemisleading if the measures are aggregated without regarding the changes of thedimensions. Kimball et al. has described three classic solutions/responses to handling theaggregation problems caused by slowly changing dimensions. In this paper; we willdescribe a fourth solution. A special aspect of our new response is that it should be usedbefore the other responses; as it will change the design of the data warehouse. Afterwards; itmay be necessary to use the classic responses to improve the design further.,International Conference on Information Technology,2005,2

For example; this may contribute to rendering prototype software “open” andmore readily useful. This paper thus identifies and briefly surveys standardization in relationto primarily the exchange and integration of spatio-temporal data. An overview of severaldata exchange languages is offered; along with reviews their potential for facilitating thecollection of test data and the leveraging of prototypes. The standards; most of which areXML-based; lend themselves to the integration of prototypes into middleware architectures;eg; as Web services.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2003,2

Pivot-based metric indexing,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Hanyu Yang; Keyu Yang,Abstract The general notion of a metric space encompasses a diverse range of data typesand accompanying similarity measures. Hence; metric search plays an important role in awide range of settings; including multimedia retrieval; data mining; and data integration. Withthe aim of accelerating metric search; a collection of pivot-based indexing techniques formetric data has been proposed; which reduces the number of potentially expensivesimilarity comparisons by exploiting the triangle inequality for pruning and validation.However; no comprehensive empirical study of those techniques exists. Existing studieseach offers only a narrower coverage; and they use different pivot selection strategies thataffect performance substantially and thus render cross-study comparisons difficult orimpossible. We offer a survey of existing pivot-based indexing techniques; and report a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Extracting visited points of interest from vehicle trajectories,Ilkcan Keles; Matthias Schubert; Peer Kröger; Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Identifying visited points of interest (PoIs) from vehicle trajectories remains an openproblem that is difficult due to vehicles parking often at some distance from the visited PoIand due to some regions having a high PoI density. We propose a visited PoI extraction(VPE) method that identifies visited PoIs using a Bayesian network. The method considersstay duration; weekday; arrival time; and PoI category to compute the probability that a PoI isvisited. We also provide a method to generate labeled data from unlabeled GPS trajectories.An experimental evaluation shows that VPE achieves a precision@ 3 value of 0.8; indicatingthat VPE is able to model the relationship between the temporal features of a stop and thecategory of the visited PoI.,Proceedings of the Fourth International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2017,1
Direction-Aware Why-Not Spatial Keyword Top-k Queries,Lei Chen; Yafei Li; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,With the continued proliferation of location-based services; a growing number of web-accessible data objects are geotagged and have text descriptions. An important query oversuch web objects is the direction-aware spatial keyword query that aims to retrieve the top-kobjects that best match query parameters in terms of spatial distance and textual similarity ina given query direction. In some cases; it can be difficult for users to specify appropriatequery parameters. After getting a query result; users may find some desired objects areunexpectedly missing and may therefore question the entire result. Enabling why-notquestions in this setting may aid users to retrieve better results; thus improving the overallutility of the query functionality. This paper studies the direction-aware why-not spatialkeyword top-k query problem. We propose efficient query refinement techniques to revive …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Reverse keyword-based location search,Xike Xie; Xin Lin; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,The proliferation of geo-textual data gives prominence to spatial keyword search. The basictop-k spatial keyword query; returns k geo-textual objects that rank the highest according totheir textual relevance and spatial proximity to query keywords and a query location. Wedefine; study; and provide means of computing the reverse top-k keyword-based locationquery. This new type of query takes a set of keywords; a query object q; and a number k asarguments; and it returns a spatial region such that any top-k spatial keyword query with thequery keywords and a location in this region would contain object q in its result. This querytargets applications in market analysis; geographical planning; and location optimization;and it may support applications related to safe zones and influence zones that are usedwidely in location-based services. We show that computing an exact query result requires …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
A density-based approach to the retrieval of top-k spatial textual clusters,Dingming Wu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Spatial keyword queries retrieve spatial textual objects that are near a querylocation and are relevant to query keywords. The paper defines the top-k spatial textualclusters (k-STC) query that returns the top-k clusters that are located close to a given querylocation; contain relevant objects with regard to given query keywords; and have an objectdensity that exceeds a given threshold. This query aims to support users who wish toexplore nearby regions with many relevant objects. To compute this query; the paperproposes a basic and an advanced algorithm that rely on on-line density-based clustering.An empirical study offers insight into the performance properties of the proposed algorithms.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,1
New lower and upper bounds for shortest distance queries on terrains,Manohar Kaul; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The increasing availability of massive and accurate laser data enables theprocessing of spatial queries on terrains. As shortest-path computation; an integral elementof query processing; is inherently expensive on terrains; a key approach to enabling efficientquery processing is to reduce the need for exact shortest-path computation in queryprocessing. We develop new lower and upper bounds on terrain shortest distances that areprovably tighter than any existing bounds. Unlike existing bounds; the new bounds do notrely on the quality of the triangulation. We show how use of the new bounds speeds upquery processing by reducing the need for exact distance computations. Speedups of ofnearly an order of magnitude are demonstrated empirically for well-known spatial queries.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,1

Computing Iterated Spatial Joins on GPUs,Claudio Silvestri; Francesco Lettich; Salvatore Orlando; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT The ability to efficiently process a significant amount of continuously updatedspatial data is mandatory for an increasing number of applications and exploiting theparallelism available on CPUs gives an additional advantage in dealing with that challenge.A recent evolution of this trend entails the use of other hardware commonly found in moderncomputers; namely the graphics processing unit (GPU); to achieve even higher parallelism.In this paper we focus on solving repeatedly a set of queries with respect to a set of objectswhen the spatial extents of both are continuously modified. We propose two algorithms todeal with this problem; both based on space partitioning and the use GPU to accelerate thespatial join computation. The first one partitions the workload according to a dynamic gridbased on the size of queries to avoid splitting them; whereas the second one periodically …,*,2012,1

Safety and Domain Independence.,Rodney W Topor,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1

Indexing of Moving Objects; Bx-Tree,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,The iDistance is an indexing and query processing technique for k nearest neighbor (kNN)queries on point data in multi-dimensional metric spaces. The kNN query is one of thehardest problems on multi-dimensional data. It has been shown analytically andexperimentally that any algorithm using hierarchical index structure based on either space-or data-partitioning is less efficient than the naive method of sequentially checking everydata record (called the sequential scan) in high-dimensional spaces [4]. Some datadistributions including the uniform distribution are particularly hard cases [1]. The iDistanceis designed to process kNN queries in high-dimensional spaces efficiently and it isespecially good for skewed data distributions; which usually occur in real-life data sets.

A Framework for Conceptual Modeling of Geographic Data Quality,Anders Friis-Christensen; Jesper V Christensen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The notion of data quality is of particular importance to geographic data. Onereason is that such data is often inherently imprecise. Another is that the usability of the datais in large part determined by how “good” the data is; as different applications of geographicdata require different qualities of the data are met. Such qualities concern the object level aswell as the attribute level of the data. This paper presents a systematic and integratedapproach to the conceptual modeling of geographic data and quality. The approachintegrates quality information with the basic model constructs. This results in a model thatenables object-oriented specification of quality requirements and of acceptable qualitylevels. More specifically; it extends the Unified Modeling Language with new modelingconstructs based on standard classes; attributes; and associations that include quality …,*,2005,1

Correct and Efficient Timestamping of Temporal Data,Kristian Torp; Richard Snodgrass; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Previous approaches to timestamping temporal data have implicitly assumed thattransactions have no duration. In this paper we identify several situations where a sequenceof operations over time within a single transaction can violate ACID properties. It has beenpreviously shown that the transaction-time dimension must be timestamped after commit.This time is not known within the transaction. We describe how to correctly implement mostqueries that make explicit reference to this (unknown) transaction time; and argue that therest; which can be syntactically identified; can only be answered with an approximation ofthe correct value. The drawback of timestamping after commit is that it requires revisitingtuples. We show that this expensive revisiting step is required only before any queries ormodifications in subsequent transactions that access prior states; in most cases; revisiting …,History,1997,1

We believe that the proposals may aid in bringingconsensus to the area of temporal data models. The current plethora of diverse andincompatible temporal data models has an impeding effect on the design of a consensustemporal data model. A single data model is highly desirable; both to the temporal databasecommunity and to the database user community at large. It is our contention that thesimultaneous foci on the modeling; presentation; representation; and querying of temporaldata have been a major cause of the proliferation of models.

Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets---Extended Version,Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Jilin Hu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: Motivated by the increasing availability of vehicle trajectory data; we propose learn-to-route; a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution. Specifically; we first construct agraph-like structure from trajectories as the routing infrastructure. Second; we enabletrajectory-based routing given an arbitrary (source; destination) pair. In the first step; given aroad network and a collection of trajectories; we propose a trajectory-based clusteringmethod that identifies regions in a road network. If a pair of regions are connected bytrajectories; we maintain the paths used by these trajectories and learn a routing preferencefor travel between the regions. As trajectories are skewed and sparse; many region pairs arenot connected by trajectories. We thus transfer routing preferences from region pairs withsufficient trajectories to such region pairs and then use the transferred preferences to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.07980,2018,*
Extracting Rankings for Spatial Keyword Queries from GPS Data,Ilkcan Keles; Christian S Jensen; Simonas Saltenis,Abstract Studies suggest that many search engine queries have local intent. We considerthe evaluation of ranking functions important for such queries. The key challenge is to beable to determine the “best” ranking for a query; as this enables evaluation of the results ofranking functions. We propose a model that synthesizes a ranking of points of interest (PoI)for a given query using historical trips extracted from GPS data. To extract trips; we proposea novel PoI assignment method that makes use of distances and temporal information. Wealso propose a PageRank-based smoothing method to be able to answer queries forregions that are not covered well by trips. We report experimental results on a large GPSdataset that show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the visits of users to PoIsand of synthesizing rankings.,LBS 2018: 14th International Conference on Location Based Services,2018,*
Towards Why-Not Spatial Keyword Top-k Queries: A Direction-Aware Approach,Lei Chen; Yafei Li; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,With the continued proliferation of location-based services; a growing number of web-accessible data objects are geo-tagged and have text descriptions. An important query oversuch web objects is the direction-aware spatial keyword query that aims to retrieve the top-kobjects that best match query parameters in terms of spatial distance and textual similarity ina given query direction. In some cases; it can be difficult for users to specify appropriatequery parameters. After getting a query result; users may find some desired objects areunexpectedly missing and may therefore question the entire result. Enabling why-notquestions in this setting may aid users to retrieve better results; thus improving the overallutility of the query functionality. This paper studies the direction-aware why-not spatialkeyword top-k query problem. We propose efficient query refinement techniques to revive …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Interactive Intersection Analysis using Trajectory Data,Johannes L Borresen; Ove Andersen; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp,Abstract Increasingly large volumes of vehicle trajectory data are becoming available. Thisdata holds the potential to offer detailed insight into important aspects of vehiculartransportation and road networks. This insight can in turn be utilized to enable a range ofimportant services. Specifically; we demonstrate a system that is capable of leveraging verylarge collections of GPS trajectories for enabling interactive analyses of traffic in roadintersections; which are often bottlenecks in road networks. These analyses are able toprovide detailed insight into the time-varying functioning of intersections; and they offer asolid; data-driven foundation for improving the capacity of intersections and the overall roadnetwork. The system enables more cost-effective analyses than what is possible withtraditional techniques.

SWOOP: Top-k Similarity Joins over Set Streams,Willi Mann; Nikolaus Augsten; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: We provide efficient support for applications that aim to continuously find pairs ofsimilar sets in rapid streams of sets. A prototypical example setting is that of tweets. A tweetis a set of words; and Twitter emits about half a billion tweets per day. Our solution makes itpossible to efficiently maintain the top-$ k $ most similar tweets from a pair of rapid Twitterstreams; eg; to discover similar trends in two cities if the streams concern cities. Using asliding window model; the top-$ k $ result changes as new sets in the stream enter thewindow or existing ones leave the window. Maintaining the top-$ k $ result under rapidstreams is challenging. First; when a set arrives; it may form a new pair for the top-$ k $result with any set already in the window. Second; when a set leaves the window; all itspairings in the top-$ k $ are invalidated and must be replaced. It is not enough to maintain …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.02476,2017,*

Indexing metric uncertain data for range queries and range joins,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Aoxiao Zhong; Christian S Jensen; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Range queries and range joins in metric spaces have applications in many areas;including GIS; computational biology; and data integration; where metric uncertain data existin different forms; resulting from circumstances such as equipment limitations; high-throughput sequencing technologies; and privacy preservation. We represent metricuncertain data by using an object-level model and a bi-level model; respectively. Two novelindexes; the uncertain pivot B^++-tree (UPB-tree) and the uncertain pivot B^++-forest (UPB-forest); are proposed in order to support probabilistic range queries and range joins for awide range of uncertain data types and similarity metrics. Both index structures use a smallset of effective pivots chosen based on a newly defined criterion and employ the B^++-tree(s) as the underlying index. In addition; we present efficient metric probabilistic range …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*
Assessing the Accuracy Benefits of On-the-Fly Trajectory Selection in Fine-Grained Travel-Time Estimation,Robert Waury; Jilin Hu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Today's one-size-fits-all approach to travel-time computation in spatial networks proceeds intwo steps. In a preparatory off-line step; a set of distributions; eg; one per hour of the day; iscomputed for each network segment. Then; when a path and a departure time are provided;a distribution for the path is computed on-line from pertinent pre-computed distributions.Motivated by the availability of massive trajectory data from vehicles; we propose acompletely on-line approach; where distributions are computed from trajectories on-the-fly;ie; when a query arrives. This new approach makes it possible to use arbitrary sets ofunderlying trajectories for a query. Specifically; we study the potential for accuracyimprovements over the one-size-fits-all approach that can be obtained using the on-the-flyapproach and report findings from an empirical study that suggest that the on-the-fly …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Crowdsourcing Based Evaluation of Ranking Approaches for Spatial Keyword Querying,Jinpeng Chen; Hua Lu; Ilkcan Keles; Christian S Jensen,Spatial keyword querying has attracted considerable research efforts in the past few years. Aprototypical query takes a location and keywords as arguments and returns the k objects thatscore the highest according to a ranking function. While different scoring functions havebeen used; how to compare different ranking functions for spatial keyword querying stillremains an open question with little investigation. We propose a crowdsourcing-basedapproach to evaluate and compare ranking functions for spatial keyword search. Given tworanking functions f 1 and f 2; we use a matrix to model all possible binary questionsregarding the different results produced by f 1 and f 2. We propose a multi-step process toreduce the number of binary questions; identifying the most important questions to ask.Further; we design a crowdsourcing model that obtains the answers to those important …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,*

Manycore GPU processing of repeated range queries over streams of moving objects observations,Francesco Lettich; Salvatore Orlando; Claudio Silvestri; Christian S Jensen,Summary The ability to timely process significant amounts of continuously updated spatialdata is mandatory for an increasing number of applications. Parallelism enables suchapplications to face this data-intensive challenge and allows the devised systems to featurelow latency and high scalability. In this paper; we focus on a specific data-intensive problemconcerning the repeated processing of huge amounts of range queries over massive sets ofmoving objects; where the spatial extent of queries and objects is continuously modifiedover time. To tackle this problem and significantly accelerate query processing; we devise ahybrid CPU/GPU pipeline that compresses data output and saves query processing work.The devised system relies on an ad-hoc spatial index leading to a problem decompositionthat results in a set of independent data-parallel tasks. The index is based on a point …,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2017,*

However; since facialimages are widely shared in social networking sites; it becomes a challenging task tosecurely employ face authentication for web services to prevent attackers fromimpersonating the legal users by using the users' online face photos. Moreover; existing faceauthentication protocols either require users to disclose their unencrypted facial images tothe authentication server or require users to execute computationally expensive securemultiparty computation protocols. For mobile devices with limited computational power; thispresents a problem that cannot be overlooked.

Among recent proposals; the following six algorithms can efficientlyperform in-memory spatial joins: Size Separation Spatial Join (S3); Spatial Grid Hash join(SGrid); TOUCH; Partition Based Spatial-Merge Join (PBSM); Plane-Sweep Join (PS); andNested-Loop Join (NL). This paper addresses the need for studies of aspects that mayinfluence the performance of spatial join algorithms. In particular; given two datasets; A andB; the following aspects may affect performance: the datasets being real or synthetic data;the distributions with respect to density and location of the datasets; and the order of …,EDBT,2017,*

The excellence of a researcher can bemeasured by their ability to publish in the scientific outlets with the highest reputation. Incontrast; the academic impact of the content of a paper can be measured by the number ofcitations to the paper. In some areas; it is easier to get citations than in other areas.However; when comparing two papers from the same area; one paper with many citationsand one paper with few; the former can generally be considered as the more interesting;relevant; important; and/or impactful one.

FoGBAT: Combining Bluetooth and GPS Data for Better Traffic Analytics,Johannes L Borresen; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp,Congestion is a major problem in many cities. In order to monitor and manage traffic; anumber of different sensor types are used to collect traffic data. This includes GPS devices inthe vehicles themselves as well as fixed Bluetooth sensors along the roads. Each sensortype has advantages and disadvantages. Where GPS has a wide coverage of the roadnetwork; Bluetooth sensors gather data from a much higher number of vehicles. In this paperwe present Fog BAT; a system that combines GPS data with Bluetooth data. The goal of thesystem is to retain the advantages of both. We show how the data types are aligned toensure that data from each sensor type is related to the exact same part of the road networkand cover the same time period.

HAG: An Energy-Proportional Data Storage Scheme for Disk Array Systems,Pei-Quan Jin; Xike Xie; Christian S Jensen; Yong Jin; Li-Hua Yue,Abstract Energy consumption has been a critical issue for data storage systems; especiallyfor modern data centers. A recent survey has showed that power costs amount to about 50%of the total cost of ownership in a typical data center; with about 27% of the system powerbeing consumed by storage systems. This paper aims at providing an effective solution toreducing the energy consumed by disk storage systems; by proposing a new approach toreduce the energy consumption. Differing from previous approaches; we adopt two newdesigns. 1) We introduce a hotness-aware and group-based system model (HAG) toorganize the disks; in which all disks are partitioned into a hot group and a cold group. Weonly make file migration between the two groups and avoid the migration within a singlegroup; so that we are able to reduce the total cost of file migration. 2) We use an on …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2015,*

A wait-free output data structure for GPU-based streaming query processing.,Claudio Silvestri; Francesco Lettich; Salvatore Orlando; Christian S Jensen,Abstract. The performance of GPU-based algorithms can be reduced significantly bycontention among memory accesses and by locking. We focus on highvolume output in GPU-based algorithms for streaming query processing: a very large number of cores processinput streams and simultaneously produce a sustained output stream whose volume issometimes orders of magnitude larger than that of the input streams. In this context; severalcores can produce results simultaneously that must be written in the output buffer accordingto some order and without conflicts with other writers. To enable this behavior; we propose awaitfree bitmap-based data structure and a usage pattern that combine to obviate the use oflocks and atomic operations. In our experiments; where the GPU-based algorithmconsidered is otherwise unchanged; the introduction of the new wait-free data structure …,SEBD,2015,*

Spatial Joins in Main Memory: Implementation Matters!,Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT A recent PVLDB paper reports on experimental analyses of ten spatial jointechniques in main memory. We build on this comprehensive study to raise awareness ofthe fact that empirical running time performance findings in main-memory settings are resultsof not only the algorithms and data structures employed; but also their implementation;which complicates the interpretation of the results. In particular; we re-implement the worstperforming technique without changing the underlying high-level algorithm; and we thenoffer evidence that the resulting re-implementation is capable of outperforming all the othertechniques. This study demonstrates that in main memory; where no time-consuming I/O canmask variations in implementation; implementation details are very important; and it offers aconcrete illustration of how it is difficult to make conclusions from empirical running time …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,*

Creating data representations for moving objects with extent from images,José Moreira; Christian S Jensen; Paulo Dias; Pedro Mesquita,Spatial entities or phenomena are often captured as time-ordered sequences ofobservations in the form of satellite or aerial images. Thus; to capture the spatio-temporalbehavior of such entities; which may change location; orientation; shape; and extentcontinuously across time; and usually are referred to as moving objects; it is necessary todevelop methods to model their spatial transformations between the observations. The aimis to obtain continuous representations that are as close as possible to the actual shapesand movements of the objects at all times. Current solutions implemented in databasemanagement systems represent the spatial transformation of a moving object betweenobservations using interpolation [1–3]. Each observation is represented by a 2D polygon;and the spatial transformations are modeled using analytical formulas representing the …,COST MOVE Workshop at Moving Objects at Sea,2013,*

Evaluating the Completeness of TSQL2,Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract The question of what is a well-designed temporal data model and query languageis a difficult; but also an important one. The consensus temporal query language TSQL2attempts to take advantage of the accumulated Knowledge gained from designing andstudying many of the earlier models and languages. In this sense; TSQL2 represents aconstructive answer to this question. Others have provided analytical answers by developingcriteria; formulated as completeness properties; for what is a good model and language.-,Recent Advances in Temporal Databases: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Temporal Databases; Zurich; Switzerland; 17–18 September 1995,2012,*

Imperialistic Incentives,Katherine Jensen,Abstract Within this essay I will summarize author Andrew Wender Cohen's 2010 articleentitled" Smuggling; Globalization; and America's Outward State; 1870-1909." I will describethe structure of the article as three distinct sections with an introduction and conclusion andcomplete a deeper analysis of the function of each section on an individual basis. Aninvestigation of the primary and especially secondary sources will help to put Cohen's articleinto context as part of a greater discussion between other historical scholars. A closer lookinto the relevance and fit of the sources/evidence used for Cohen's article will becomplemented by a study of Cohen's authority within the historical field to determine if hisargument is warranted. My conclusions about the article and the crux of Cohen's argumentwill be best presented by its parallels to Karen Yamashita's Tropic of Orange; I will find …,Anthós,2012,*

Elements of a spatial web,Christian S Jensen,Abstract Driven by factors such as the increasingly mobile use of the web and theproliferation of geo-positioning technologies; the web is rapidly acquiring a spatial aspect.Specifically; content and users are being geo-tagged; and services are being developed thatexploit these tags. The research community is hard at work inventing means of efficientlysupporting new spatial query functionality. Points of interest with a web presence; calledspatial web objects; have a location as well as a textual description. Spatio-textual queriesreturn such objects that are near a location argument and are relevant to a text argument. Animportant element in enabling such queries is to be able to rank spatial web objects. Anotheris to be able to determine the relevance of an object to a query. Yet another is to enable theefficient processing of such queries. The talk covers recent results on spatial web object …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2010,*

Indexing of the Current and Near-Future Positions of Moving Objects,Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,An example of index oriented towards human navigation is the web directory. In such anindex; links to sites are organized into hierarchical categories; according to the sites'contents. In web directories; normally the tasks of collecting and categorizing pages arecarried out under supervision of human editors. An example of index not oriented to humansis a hidden list of metadata. Metadata are data about data. As a mean of assisting a searchengine to locate content or an information entity; they can be used to describe that content orentity.

Challenges in the Tracking and Prediction of Scheduled-Vehicle Journeys: in Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Pervasive Transportation Systems;...,Christian Søndergaard Jensen; Dalia Tiesyte,Abstract: A number of applications in areas such as logistics; cargo delivery; and collectivetransport involve the management of fleets of vehicles that are expected to travel alongknown routes according to fixed schedules. Due to road construction; accidents; and otherunanticipated conditions; the vehicles deviate from their schedules. At the same time; thereis a need for the infrastructure surrounding the vehicles to continually know the actual statusof the vehicles. For example; anticipated arrival times of buses may have to be displayed atbus stops. It is a fundamental challenge to maintain this type of knowledge with minimal cost.This paper characterizes the problem of real-time vehicle tracking using wirelesscommunication; and of predicting the future status of the vehicles when their movements arerestricted to given routes and when they follow schedules with a best effort.

The provisioning of such techniques is challenging; both because of the nature ofthe data; which reflects continuous movement; and because of the types of queries to besupported. This paper proposes the BBx-index structure; which indexes the positions ofmoving objects; given as linear functions of time; at any time. The index stores linearizedmoving-object locations in a forest of B+-trees. The index supports queries that selectobjects based on temporal and spatial constraints; such as queries that retrieve all objectswhose positions fall within a spatial range during a set of time intervals.

Integrating Multiple Calendars using Zaman,Bedirhan Urgun; Curtis E Dyreson; Nick Kline; Jessica K Miller; Richard T Snodgrass; Michael D Soo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Programmers world-wide are interested in developing applications that can beused internationally. Part of the internationalization effort is the ability to engineerapplications to use dates and times that conform to local calendars yet can inter-operate withdates and times in other calendars; for instance between the Gregorian and Islamiccalendars. Gzaman is a system that provides a natural language and calendar-independentframework for integrating multiple calendars. Gzaman performs “runtimebinding” ofcalendars and language support. A running Gzaman system dynamically loads calendarsand language support tables from XML-formatted files. Loading a calendar integrates it withother; already loaded calendars; enabling users of Gzaman to add; compare; and converttimes between multiple calendars.

Supporting Frequent Updates in R-Trees: A Bottom-Up Approach,CUI Bin; Cui Keng Lik Teo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Advances in hardware-related technologies promise to enable new datamanagement applications that monitor continuous processes. In these applications;enormous amounts of state samples are obtained via sensors and are streamed to adatabase. Further; updates are very frequent and may exhibit locality. While the R-tree is theindex of choice for multi-dimensional data with low dimensionality; and is thus relevant tothese applications; R-tree updates are also relatively inefficient. We present a bottom-upupdate strategy for R-trees that generalizes existing update techniques and aims to improveupdate performance. It has different levels of reorganization—ranging from global to local—during updates; avoiding expensive top-down updates. A compact main-memory summarystructure that allows direct access to the R-tree index nodes is used together with efficient …,*,2004,*

Towards a Handbook for User-Centred Mobile Application Design,Susanne Boll; Martin Breunig; Nigel Davies; Christian Jensen; Birgitta König-Ries; Florian Matthes; Simonas Saltenis; Thomas Schwarz,The starting point for the discussions in the working group was the observation that it isharder to design mobile applications than “normal” ones. Starting from there; we first tried toidentify reasons why this is the case. Our approach to doing so was to first collect anddiscuss sample scenarios for mobile applications and their characteristics. We then sharedour experiences in developing applications for some of these scenarios. We quickly realizedthat the term “mobile applications” covers an area that is too broad to come up with anycommon characteristics for all the different application domains and scenarios. Therefore;we decided to concentrate on applications supporting mobile users (in contrast to; egapplications where exclusively or primarily the code is mobile or applications with no humanuser).

Requirements for UML and OWL Integration Tool for User Data Consistency Modeling and Testing,JP Nytun; Christian Søndergaard Jensen; VA Oleshchuk,Abstract: The amount of data available on the Internet is continuously increasing;consequentially there is a growing need for tools that help to analyse the data. Testing ofconsistency among data received from different sources is made difficult by the number ofdifferent languages and schemas being used. In this paper we analyze requirements for atool that support integration of UML models and ontologies written in languages like theW3C Web Ontology Language (OWL). The tool can be used in the following way: afterloading two legacy models into the tool; the tool user connects them by inserting modelingconstructs like classes; associations and Object Constraint Language (OCL) statements.

This chapter assumes an Internet-service scenario where objects thathave not reported their position within a specified duration of time are expected to no longerbe interested in; or of interest to; the service. Due to the possibility of many “expiring'”objects; a highly dynamic database results. The chapter describes two R-tree basedtechniques for the indexing of the current positions of such objects.

METAXPathextends XPath with support for XML metadata. XPath is a specification language forlocations in an XML document. It serves as the basis for XML query languages like XSLTand the XML Query Algebra. The METAXPath data model is a nested XPath tree. Each levelof metadata induces a new level of nesting. The data model separates metadata and datainto different dataspaces; supports meta-metadata; and enables sharing of metadatacommon to a group of nodes without duplication. The METAXPath query language has alevel shift operator to shift a query from a data level to a metadata level. METAXPathmaximally reuses XPath hence the changes needed to support metadata are few.METAXPath is fully compatible with XPath.,Journal of Digital Information,2001,*

Advanced Implementation Techniques for Scientific Data Warehouses,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Data warehouses using a multidimensional view of data have become very popularin both business and science in recent years. Data warehouses for scientific purposes suchas medicine and bio-chemistry1 pose several great challenges to existing data warehousetechnology. Data warehouses usually use pre-aggregated data to ensure fast queryresponse. However; pre-aggregation cannot be used in practice if the dimension structuresor the relationships between facts and dimensions are irregular. A technique for overcomingthis limitation and some experimental results are presented. Queries over scientific datawarehouses often need to reference data that is external to the data warehouse; eg; datathat is too complex to be handled by current data warehouse technology; data that is”owned” by other organizations; or data that is updated frequently. An example of this are …,Advanced Implementation Techniques for Scientific Data Warehouses,2000,*

However; work in this area is guided by related research from the spatialand temporal domains; so far; with little attention towards the true nature of spatiotemporalphenomena. In this work the focus is on a spatiotemporal sub-domain; namely moving pointobjects. We present new types of spatiotemporal queries; as well as algorithms to processthose. Further; we introduce two access methods to index these kinds of data; namely theSpatio-Temporal R-tree (STR-tree) and the Trajectory-Bundle tree (TB-tree). The former isan R-tree based access method that considers the trajectory identity in the index as well;while the latter is a hybrid structure; which preserves trajectories as well as allows for R-treetypical range search in the data.

Effective Timestamping in Databases,A TimeCenter,Many existing database applications place various timestamps on their data; renderingtemporal values such as dates and times prevalent in database tables. During the past twodecades; several dozen temporal data models have appeared; all with timestamps beingintegral components. The models have used timestamps for encoding two speci c temporalaspects of database facts; namely transaction time; when the facts are current in thedatabase; and valid time; when the facts are true in the modeled reality. However; with fewexceptions; the assignment of timestamp values has been considered only in the context ofindividual modi cation statements. This paper takes the next logical step: It considers the useof timestamping for capturing transaction and valid time in the context of transactions.

An Extensible Notation for Spatiotemporal Index Queries,Vassilis J Tsotras; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Temporal; spatial and spatiotemporal queries are inherently multidimensional;combining predicates on explicit attributes with predicates on time dimension (s) and spatialdimension (s). Much confusion has prevailed in the literature on access methods becauseno consistent notation exists for referring to such queries. As a contribution towardseliminating this problem; we propose a new and simple notation for spatiotemporal queries.The notation aims to address the selection-based spatiotemporal queries commonly studiedin the literature of access methods. The notation is extensible and can be applied to moregeneral multidimensional; selection-based queries.,SIGMOD Record,1997,*

Evaluating and Enhancing the Completeness of TSQL2,HB Michael; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract The question of what is a well-designed temporal data model and query languageis a di cult; but also an important one. The consensus temporal query language TSQL2attempts to take advantage of the accumulated knowledge gained from designing andstudying many of the earlier models and languages. In this sense; TSQL2 represents aconstructive answer to this question. Others have provided analytical answers by developingcriteria; formulated as completeness properties; for what is a good model and language.This paper applies important existing completeness notions to TSQL2 in order to evaluatethe design of TSQL2. It is shown that TSQL2 satis es only a subset of these completenessnotions. In response to this; a minimally modi ed version of TSQL2; termed Applied TSQL2;is proposed; this new language satis es the notions of temporal semi-completeness and …,*,1995,*

Cursors,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass; TY Cliff Leung,The data model of TSQL2 was designed as a conceptually minimal valid-time extension of thestandard relational model. Facts in a valid-time table have associated the times when they areassumed to be true in the modeled reality. Tuples encode facts (atomic or composite); and theadopted data model asso- ciates valid times with facts at the level of tuples. In order to not replicatefacts; ie; have several value-equivalent tuples with different associated time periods; tuples areassociated with valid-time elements; finite unions of periods … Storage and display ofvalid-time tables is not restrained by the above choice of data model. Indeed; several formatsmay coexist for both storage and display. As will be described; we have here adopted a verysimple display format that is well-suited for accessing valid-time tables via cursors. Other displayformats may be added later … The association of tuples with valid-time elements …,*,1995,*

Valid-time Selection and Projection in TSQL2,Suchen Hsu; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Temporal databases have now been studied for more than a decade. During thatperiod of time; numerous query languages have been proposed for temporal databases.One of the essential components of a temporal query language is valid-time selection; whichallows the user to retrieve tuples according to their valid-time relationship. Often; thiscomponent is closely tied to another important component; valid-time projection; whichdefines the timestamps of the tuples in query results. Here; nine different temporal querylanguages; primarily SQL and QUEL extensions; are examined with a focus on valid-timeselection and projection. Based on that survey; the specific design of the valid-time selectionand projection components of the consensus temporal query language TSQL2 arepresented.,*,1994,*

Efficient Evaluation of the Valid-Time Natural Join Michael D. Soo1 Richard T. Snodgrass1,Christian S Jensen,Abstract Joins are arguably the most important relational operators. Poor implementationsare tantamount to computing the Cartesian product of the input relations. In a temporaldatabase; the problem is more acute for two reasons. First; conventional techniques aredesigned for the optimization ofjoins with equality predicates; rather than inequalitypredicates which are prevalent in valid-time queries. Second; the presence of temporally-varying data dramatically increases the size of the database. These factors require newtechniques to efficiently evaluate valid-timejoins. We address this need for efficient joinevaluation in databases supporting valid-time. A new temporal-join algorithm based on tuplepartitioning is introduced. This algorithm avoids the quadratic cost of nested-loop evaluationmethods; it also avoids sorting. The algorithm is then adapted to an incremental mode of …,*,1993,*

Replication Gives High Performance Query Processing in Relational Models Extended with Transaction Time,Christian S Jensen; Leo Mark,Our research project can be described as follows. We have defined a static rollbackrelational data model with tuple time-stamping [5; 6]. For each relation defined by the user;the system maintains a backlog that records all requests for changes to its user-definedrelation. The backlogs contain all the data necessary for answering any query withoutreplication. We have designed an extended query language that allows access to previousstates of relations (including backlogs) and allows to ask queries about the change history ofrelations. We also have developed vacuuming facilities to control otherwise ever-growingamounts of data in a transaction time database [7]. To support queries efficiently; wemaintain a cache of views stored as either actual data (true replication) or as pointerstructures (pseudo replication). A special cache index is used for fast identification of …,*,1990,*
Using Caching; Cache Indexing; and,Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT We present a framework for query processing in the relational model extendedwith transaction time. The framework integrates standard query optimization andcomputation techniques with new differential computation techniques. Differentialcomputation incrementally or decrementally computes a query from the cached and indexedresults of previous computations. The use of differential computation techniques is essentialin order to provide efﬁcient processing of queries that access very large temporal relations.Altemative query plans are integrated into a state transition network; where the state spaceincludes backlogs of base relations; cached results from previous computations; a cacheindex; and intermediate results; the transitions include standard relational algebra operators;operators for constructing differential ﬁles; operators for differential computation; and …,*,1989,*

Christian S. Jensen,Leo Mark,Abstract In conventional databases; the amount of data typically reaches a certain level andis then relatively stable. In databases supporting transaction time; old data are retained; andthe anount of data is ever growing. Even with continued advances in mass storagetechnology; vacuuming (ie; deletion or off-line storage of data) will eventually be necessary.At the same time; the fundamental principle; that history cannot be changed; of transactiontime databases must be obeyed. This paper provides a framework for vacuumingsubsystems for relational transaction time databases. Our main focus is to establish afoundation for correct and cooperative query pro-cessing through the modification of queriesthat cannot be processed due to vacuuming. In doing this; we provide language facilities forspecifying vacuuming; we present three classifications of vacuuming specifications; and …,*,*,*
Skyline Ordering: A Flexible Framework for Efficient Resolution of Size,Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a set of multi-dimensional points; a skyline query returns the interestingpoints that are not dominated by other points. It has been observed that the actual cardinality(s) of a skyline query result may differ substantially from the desired result cardinality (k);which has prompted studies on how to reduce s for the case where k< s. This paper goesfurther by addressing the general case where the relationship between k and s is not knownbeforehand. Due to their complexity; the existing pointwise ranking and set-widemaximization techniques are not well suited for this problem. Moreover; the former oftenincurs too many ties in its ranking; and the latter is inapplicable for k> s. Based on theseobservations; the paper proposes a new approach; called skyline ordering; that forms askyline-based partitioning of a given data set; such that an order exists among the …,History,*,*

James Clifford; Curtis E. Dyreson; Richard T. Snodgrass; Tomás Isakowitz; and Christian S. Jensen,T Snodgrass,Now is an English noun meaning “at the present time”[16].

In this chapter; we give precise;but informal; semantics for this familiar term and discuss representations and querylanguage constructs for supporting now in TSQL2. We also explore the related concepts of“infinite future” and “infinite past.” In general; we treat now as a variable that is assigned aspecific time during query or update evaluation. The time that is assigned to the variabledepends upon when the query or update is evaluated. We call the time assigned to thevariablenow the reference time as it is specific to the reference frame of the observer; in thecase of now the observer is the query (or update).

Temporal Specialization Christian S. Jensen Richard T. Snodgrass,Christian S Jensen Richard T Snodgrass,The time of validity of a fact in a temporal relation and the time the fact was recorded in therelation are ostensibly independent. Yet; in many applications of temporal relations; the twotimes interact in restricted ways. For example; in the monitoring of temperatures during achemical experiment; temperature measurements are recorded in the temporal relation afterthey are valid; due to transmission delays. The resulting relation is termed retroactive.Alternatively; salary payments recorded in the temporal relation of a bank are recordedbefore the time the funds become accessible to employees; resulting in a predictive relation.We explore a variety of temporal relations with specialized relationships betweentransaction and valid time. Such special-ized temporal relations occur in many practicalapplications; and the framework presented here is a means of capturing more of the …,*,*,*

Pre-aggregation; theprior materialization of aggregate queries for later use; is an essential technique for ensuringadequate response time during data analysis. Full pre-aggregation; where all combinationsof aggregates are materialized; is infeasible. Instead; modern OLAP systems adopt thepractical pre-aggregation approach of materializing only select combinations of aggregatesand then re-use these for efficiently computing other aggregates. However; this re-use ofaggregates is contingent on the dimension hierarchies and the relationships between factsand dimensions satisfying stringent constraints.

Semantics of Time-Varying Attributes and Their Use for Temporal,Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract This paper concerns the design of temporal relational database schemas. Normalforms play a central role during the design of conventional relational databases; and wehave previously extended all existing relational normal forms to apply to temporal relations.However; these normal forms are all atemporal in nature and do not fully take into accountthe temporal semantics of the attributes of temporal relations. Consequently; additionalguidelines for the design of temporal relations are required. This paper presents asystematic study of important aspects of the temporal semantics of attributes. One suchaspect is the observation and update patterns of attributes| when an attribute changes valueand when the changes are recorded in the database. A related aspect is when the attributeshave values. A third aspect is the values themselves of attributes| how to derive a value …,History,*,*

A Foundation for Representing and Querying Moving Objects,G Ralf Hartmut; Martin Erwig; Christian S Jensen; Nikos A Lorentzos; Markus Schneider; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Spatio-temporal databases deal with geometries changing over time. The goal of our work isto provide a DBMS data model and query language capable of handling such time-dependent geometries; including those changing continuously which describe movingobjects. Two fundamental abstractions are moving point and moving region; describingobjects for which only the time-dependent position; or position and extent; are of interest;respectively. We propose to represent such time-dependent geometries as attribute datatypes with suitable operations; that is; to provide an abstract data type extension to a DBMSdata model and query language. This paper presents a design of such a system of abstractdata types. It turns out that besides the main types of interest; moving point and movingregion; a relatively large number of auxiliary data types is needed. For example; one …,*,*,*

Indexing of Moving Objects; B+-TreeCE1,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,The Bx-tree [1] is a query and update efficient B+-tree-11 based index structure for movingobjects which are rep-12 resented as linear functions. The Bx-tree uses a lineariza-13 tiontechnique to exploit the volatility of the data values 14 being indexed ie; moving-objectlocations. Specifically; 15 data values are first partitioned according to their update 16 timeand then linearized within the partitions according 17 to a space-filling curve; eg; the Peanoor Hilbert curve. 18 The resulting values are combined with their time partition 19 informationand then indexed by a single B+-tree. Figure 1 20 shows an example of the Bx-tree with thenumber of index 21 partitions equal to two within one maximum update inter-22 val tmu. Inthis example; there are maximum of three 23 partitions existing at the same time. Afterlinearization; 24 object locations inserted at time 0 are indexed in partition 25 1; object …,*,*,*

VLDB 2000 Submission,Torben Bach Pedersen; Arie Shoshani; Junmin Gu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems based on a dimensional view ofdata have found widespread use in business applications and are being used increasinglyin non-standard applications. These systems provide good performance and ease-of-use.However; the complex structures and relationships inherent in data in nonstandardapplications are not accommodated well by OLAP systems. In contrast; object databasesystems are built to handle such complexity; but do not support OLAP-type querying well.This paper presents the concepts and techniques underlying a flexible;“multi-model”federated system that enables OLAP users to exploit simultaneously the features of OLAPand object systems. The system allows data to be handled using the most appropriate datamodel and technology: OLAP systems for dimensional data and object database systems …,*,*,*

Systematic Change Management in Dimensional Data Warehousing,R Bliujute S Saltenis G Slivinskas; CS Jensen,Abstract With the widespread and increasing use of data warehousing in industry; thedesign of effective data warehouses and their maintenance has become a focus of attention.Independently of this; the area of temporal databases has been an active area of researchfor well beyond a decade. This article identifies shortcomings of so-called star schemas;which are widely used in industrial warehousing; in their ability to handle change andsubsequently studies the application of temporal techniques for solving these shortcomings.Star schemas represent a new approach to database design and have gained widespreadpopularity in data warehousing; but while they have many attractive properties; star schemasdo not contend well with so-called slowly changing dimensions and with state-oriented data.We study the use of so-called temporal star schemas that may provide a solution to the …,*,*,*
