LCARS: a location-content-aware recommender system,Hongzhi Yin; Yizhou Sun; Bin Cui; Zhiting Hu; Ling Chen,Abstract Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provideus with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. Auser can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limiteddistance range; so the user-item matrix is very sparse; which creates a big challenge fortraditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes morechallenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history. In thispaper; we propose LCARS; a location-content-aware recommender system that offers aparticular user a set of venues (eg; restaurants) or events (eg; concerts and exhibitions) bygiving consideration to both personal interest and local preference.

Challenging the long tail recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Jing Li; Junjie Yao; Chen Chen,Abstract The success of" infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon. com and Netflix hasbeen largely attributed to a" long tail" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventoryis not in high demand; these niche products; unavailable at limited-inventory competitors;generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition; tail productavailability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of" one-stopshopping" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However; most of existingrecommender systems; especially collaborative filter based methods; can not recommendtail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that torecommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail productsadds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this paper; we propose a novel …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,100
A Temporal Context-Aware Model for User Behavior Modeling in Social Media Systems,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Ling Chen; Zhiting Hu; Zi Huang,Abstract Social media provides valuable resources to analyze user behaviors and captureuser preferences. This paper focuses on analyzing user behaviors in social media systemsand designing a latent class statistical mixture model; named temporal context-awaremixture model (TCAM); to account for the intentions and preferences behind user behaviors.Based on the observation that the behaviors of a user in social media systems are generallyinfluenced by intrinsic interest as well as the temporal context (eg; the public's attention atthat time); TCAM simultaneously models the topics related to users' intrinsic interests and thetopics related to temporal context and then combines the influences from the two factors tomodel user behaviors in a unified way.

Modeling Location-based User Rating Profiles for Personalized Recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Ling Chen; Zhiting Hu; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract This article proposes LA-LDA; a location-aware probabilistic generative model thatexploits location-based ratings to model user profiles and produce recommendations. Mostof the existing recommendation models do not consider the spatial information of users oritems; however; LA-LDA supports three classes of location-based ratings; namely spatialuser ratings for nonspatial items; nonspatial user ratings for spatial items; and spatial userratings for spatial items. LA-LDA consists of two components; ULA-LDA and ILA-LDA; whichare designed to take into account user and item location information; respectively. Thecomponent ULA-LDA explicitly incorporates and quantifies the influence from local publicpreferences to produce recommendations by considering user home locations; whereas thecomponent ILA-LDA recommends items that are closer in both taste and travel distance to …,Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,55
A unified model for stable and temporal topic detection from social media data,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Yuxin Huang; Junjie Yao,Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media.Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (eg; breaking events) andstable topics (eg; user interests). Due to their different natures; it is important and useful todistinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However; such adiscrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are veryshort in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditionalapproaches. In this paper; we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporaltopics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically; a unified user-temporal mixturemodel is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model'sperformance; we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,51
Geo-SAGE: A Geographical Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial Item Recommendation,Weiqing Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Ling Chen; Yizhou Sun; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs); spatial itemrecommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive andinteresting venues and events; especially when users travel out of town. However; thisrecommendation is very challenging compared to the traditional recommender systems. Auser can visit only a limited number of spatial items; leading to a very sparse user-itemmatrix. Most of the items visited by a user are located within a short distance from wherehe/she lives; which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far awayplace. Moreover; user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across differentgeographical regions. In light of this; we propose Geo-SAGE; a geographical sparse additivegenerative model for spatial item recommendation in this paper.

Terec: A temporal recommender system over tweet stream,Chen Chen; Hongzhi Yin; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui,Abstract As social media further integrates into our daily lives; people are increasinglyimmersed in real-time social streams via services such as Twitter and Weibo. One importantobservation in these online social platforms is that users' interests and the popularity oftopics shift very fast; which poses great challenges on existing recommender systems toprovide the right topics at the right time. In this paper; we extend the online rankingtechnique and propose a temporal recommender system-TeRec. In TeRec; when postingtweets; users can get recommendations of topics (hashtags) according to their real-timeinterests; they can also generate fast feedbacks according to the recommendations. TeRecprovides the browser-based client interface which enables the users to access the real timetopic recommendations; and the server side processes and stores the real-time stream …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,29

Although humanmovement exhibits sequential patterns in LBSNs; most current studies on spatial itemrecommendations do not consider the sequential influence of locations. Leveragingsequential patterns in spatial item recommendation is; however; very challenging;considering 1) users' check-in data in LBSNs has a low sampling rate in both space andtime; which renders existing prediction techniques on GPS trajectories ineffective; 2) theprediction space is extremely large; with millions of distinct locations as the next predictiontarget; which impedes the application of classical Markov chain models; and 3) there is no …,The 32nd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'16),2016,25

Adapting to User Interest Drift for POI Recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui; Hao Wang; Kai Zheng; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Point-of-Interest recommendation is an essential means to help people discover attractivelocations; especially when people travel out of town or to unfamiliar regions. While agrowing line of research has focused on modeling user geographical preferences for POIrecommendation; they ignore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographicalregions; ie; users tend to have different interests when they travel in different regions; whichdiscounts the recommendation quality of existing methods; especially for out-of-town users.In this paper; we propose a latent class probabilistic generative model Spatial-TemporalLDA (ST-LDA) to learn region-dependent personal interests according to the contents oftheir checked-in POIs at each region. As the users' check-in records left in the out-of-townregions are extremely sparse; ST-LDA incorporates the crowd's preferences by …,IEEE Transaction on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE),2016,23

We call thisthe Expert Group Formation problem in this paper. In order to reduce various potential socialinfluence among team members and avoid following the crowd; we require that themembers of χ'not only meet the skill requirements of the task; but also be diverse. To quantifythe diversity of a group of experts; we propose one metric based on the social influenceincurred by the subgraph in G that only involves χ'. We analyze the problem of DiverseExpert Group Formation and show that it is NP-hard.

In articles; blogs; and wikis; people express their points of view in the form ofarguments; ie; claims that are supported by evidence. Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments. In this paper; we propose acrowdsourcing-based approach to build a corpus of arguments; an argumentation base;thereby mediating the trade-off of automatic text-mining and manual processing in argumentdiscovery.

Spatio-Temporal Recommendation in Social Media,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui,In this book; we will guide you through the world of spatiotemporal recommendation in socialmedia; which aims to help users find their potentially preferred items by mining thespatiotemporal data generated by the users in social media sites and apps. Thespatiotemporal data imply extensive knowledge about individuals' behaviors; mobility; andinterests. It also bridges the gap between the online social networks and the physical world;which enables us to better understand the users; improve user experiences; and designoptimal recommendation systems. Targeted advertisement recommendation in social mediais one of the application scenarios; which is predicted to generate hundreds of billions ofdollars revenue.

Keyword-Aware Continuous kNN Query on Road Networks.,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Han Su; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,It is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices;which describe auxiliary information (eg; business; traffic; etc.) associated with the vertex. Insuch road networks; which are modelled as weighted undirected graphs; each vertex isassociated with one or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight; which canbe its physical length or travelling time. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword-aware continuous k nearest neighbour (KCkNN) search on road networks; which computesthe k nearest vertices that contain the query keywords issued by a moving object andmaintains the results continuously as the object is moving on the road network.

A Unified Framework for Fine-Grained Opinion Mining from Online Reviews,Hao Wang; Chen Zhang; Hongzhi Yin; Wei Wang; Jun Zhang; Fanjiang Xu,Extracting opinion words and opinion targets from online reviews is an important task for fine-grained opinion mining. Usually; traditional extraction methods under the pipeline-basedframework have higher precision but lower recall; while methods in the propagation-basedframework possess greater recall but poorer precision. To achieve better performance bothin precision and recall; this paper proposes a unified framework for fine-grained opinionmining; combining propagation with refinement in a dynamic and iterative process. In thepropagation process; syntactic patterns are chosen as opinion relations to extract newopinion words and targets. Besides; syntactic patterns are further generalized to make themmore flexible and scalable. In the refinement process; a three-layer opinion relations graph(ORG) model is constructed based on three types of candidates: opinion word candidates …,The 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'16),2016,7

Retaining data from streams of social platforms with minimal regret,Thanh Tam Nguyen; Chi Thang Duong; Matthias Weidlich; Hongzhi Yin; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Abstract Today's social platforms; such as Twitter and Facebook; continuously generatemassive volumes of data. The resulting data streams exceed any reasonable limit forpermanent storage; especially since data is often redundant; overlapping; sparse; andgenerally of low value. This calls for means to retain solely a small fraction of the data in anonline manner. In this paper; we propose techniques to effectively decide which data toretain; such that the induced loss of information; the regret of neglecting certain data; isminimized. These techniques enable not only efficient processing of massive streamingdata; but are also adaptive and address the dynamic nature of social media.

LSIF: A System for Large-scale Information Flow Detection Based on Topic-related Semantic Similarity Measurement,Meng Zhao; Hao Wang; Liangliang Cao; Chen Zhang; Hongzhi Yin; Fanjiang Xu,Information flow detection is dedicated to tracking the dynamics and evolution of Webinformation spreading across the entire web over time. How to choose a comfortableinformation granularity to detect and how to track information evolution from one to anotherare the main challenges. Besides; the technological problem of doing that with a large scaleinformation efficiently is yet to be solved. In this paper; we propose a system approach (LSIF)for a large-scale topic-related semantic information flow detection. We view the sentence asthe basic information unit. Moreover; we represent a word or a sentence as continuous high-dimensional vector; which is used for semantic similarity measurement; with the help of wordembedding and Fisher kernel.

Predicting Passengers in Public Transportation Using Smart Card Data,Mengyu Dou; Tieke He; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Luo; Zhenyu Chen,Abstract Transit prediction has long been a hot research problem; which is central to thepublic transport agencies and operators; as evidence to support scheduling and urbanplanning. There are several previous work aiming at transit prediction; but they are all fromthe macro perspective. In this paper; we study the prediction of individuals in the context ofpublic transport. Existing research on the prediction of individual behaviour are mostly foundin information retrieval and recommender systems; leaving it untouched in the area of publictransport. We propose a NLP based back-propagation neural network for the prediction jobin this paper. Specifically; we adopt the concept of “bag of words” to build user profile; anduse the result of clustering as input of back-propagation neural network to generatepredictions.

Community specific temporal topic discovery from social media,Zhiting Hu; Chong Wang; Junjie Yao; Eric Xing; Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui,Abstract: Studying temporal dynamics of topics in social media is very useful to understandonline user behaviors. Most of the existing work on this subject usually monitors the globaltrends; ignoring variation among communities. Since users from different communities tendto have varying tastes and interests; capturing community-level temporal change canimprove the understanding and management of social content. Additionally; it can furtherfacilitate the applications such as community discovery; temporal prediction and onlinemarketing. However; this kind of extraction becomes challenging due to the intricateinteractions between community and topic; and intractable computational complexity. In thispaper; we take a unified solution towards the community-level topic dynamic extraction.

A Spatial-Temporal Topic Model for the Semantic Annotation of POIs in LBSNs,Tieke He; Hongzhi Yin; Zhenyu Chen; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq; Bin Luo,Abstract Semantic tags of points of interest (POIs) are a crucial prerequisite for locationsearch; recommendation services; and data cleaning. However; most POIs in location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) are either tag-missing or tag-incomplete. This article aims todevelop semantic annotation techniques to automatically infer tags for POIs. We first analyzetwo LBSN datasets and observe that there are two types of tags; category-related ones andsentimental ones; which have unique characteristics. Category-related tags are hierarchical;whereas sentimental ones are category-aware. All existing related work has adoptedclassification methods to predict high-level category-related tags in the hierarchy; but theycannot apply to infer either low-level category tags or sentimental ones.

In thispaper; we investigate the problem of next POI recommendation by considering thesequential influences of POIs; as a natural extension of the general POI recommendation;but it is more challenging than the general POI recommendation; due to that (1) users'preferences are dynamic; and the next POI recommendation requires tracking the change ofuser preferences in a real-time manner; and (2) the prediction space is extremely large; withmillions of distinct POIs as the next prediction target; which impedes the application ofclassical Markov chain models.

Besides; they ignore theinfluence of public comments for subsequent users' check-in behaviors. Specifically; it isintuitive that users would refuse to check in to a spatial item whose historical reviews seemnegative overall; even though it might fit their interests.

Call Attention to Rumors: Deep Attention Based Recurrent Neural Networks for Early Rumor Detection,Tong Chen; Lin Wu; Xue Li; Jun Zhang; Hongzhi Yin; Yang Wang,Abstract: The proliferation of social media in communication and information disseminationhas made it an ideal platform for spreading rumors. Automatically debunking rumors at theirstage of diffusion is known as\textit {early rumor detection}; which refers to dealing withsequential posts regarding disputed factual claims with certain variations and highly textualduplication over time. Thus; identifying trending rumors demands an efficient yet flexiblemodel that is able to capture long-range dependencies among postings and produce distinctrepresentations for the accurate early detection. However; it is a challenging task to applyconventional classification algorithms to rumor detection in earliness since they rely on hand-crafted features which require intensive manual efforts in the case of large amount of posts.This paper presents a deep attention model on the basis of recurrent neural networks …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05973,2017,2

However; this type of recommendation is very challenging compared totraditional recommender systems. A user may visit only a limited number of spatial items;leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. This matrix becomes even sparser when the usertravels to a distant place; as most of the items visited by a user are usually located within ashort distance from the user's home.

The proposed SCA model contains two pathways. The first pathwayis a deep neural network customized for semantic-aware saliency; which aims to capture thesemantic information in images; especially for the presence of meaningful objects and objectparts. The second pathway is based on on-line feature learning and informationmaximization; which learns an adaptive representation for the input and discovers the highcontrast salient patterns within the image context. The two pathways characterize both long-term and short-term attention cues and are integrated using maxima normalization.Experimental results on artificial images and several benchmark dataset demonstrate the …,The Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI'17),2017,2

Using detected visual objects to index video database,Xingzhong Du; Hongzhi Yin; Zi Huang; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we focus on how to use visual objects to index the videos. Two tablesare constructed for this purpose; namely the unique object table and the occurrence table.The former table stores the unique objects which appear in the videos; while the latter tablestores the occurrence information of these unique objects in the videos. In previous works;these two tables are generated manually by a top-down process. That is; the unique objecttable is given by the experts at first; then the occurrence table is generated by the annotatorsaccording to the unique object table. Obviously; such process which heavily depends onhuman labors limits the scalability especially when the data are dynamic or large-scale.

Answer validation for generic crowdsourcing tasks with minimal efforts,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Crowdsourcing has been established as an essential means to scale humancomputation in diverse Web applications; reaching from data integration to informationretrieval. Yet; crowd workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise. Large workerpopulations are heterogeneous and comprise a significant amount of faulty workers. As aconsequence; quality insurance for crowd answers is commonly seen as the Achilles heel ofcrowdsourcing. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed inrecent years; a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required.Such validation; however; is typically conducted by experts; whose availability is limited andwhose work incurs comparatively high costs. This work aims at guiding an expert in thevalidation of crowd answers. We present a probabilistic model that helps to identify the …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1
Mobi-SAGE: A sparse additive generative model for mobile App recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Liang Chen; Weiqing Wang; Xingzhong Du; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Xiaofang Zhou,With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobileapplications (Apps); App recommendation becomes an emergent task that will benefitdifferent stockholders of mobile App ecosystems. Unlike traditional items; Apps haveprivileges to access a user's sensitive resources (eg; contacts; messages and locations)which may lead to security risk or privacy leak. Thus; users' choosing of Apps are influencedby not only their personal interests but also their privacy preferences. Moreover; user privacypreferences vary with App categories. In this paper; we propose a mobile sparse additivegenerative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering both user interests andcategory-aware user privacy preferences. We collected a real-world dataset from 360 Appstore-the biggest Android App platform in China; and conduct extensive experiments on it …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Recommendation in context-rich environment: An information network analysis approach,Yizhou Sun; Hongzhi Yin; Xiang Ren,Abstract Recommendation has received tremendous attention recently due to its wide andsuccessful applications across different domains. Different from traditional setting ofrecommendation tasks; modern recommendation tasks are usually exposed in a context-richenvironment. For example; in addition to a user-item rating matrix; users and items areconnected to other objects via different relationships and they are usually associated withrich attributes; such as text and spatio-temporal information. It turns out that heterogeneousinformation network serves a natural data model to capture the rich context of theserecommendation tasks.

Jointly Modeling Heterogeneous Temporal Properties in Location Recommendation,Saeid Hosseini; Hongzhi Yin; Meihui Zhang; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems suggest interesting locations tousers based on their previous check-ins via location-based social networks (LBSNs).Individuals visiting a location are partially affected by many factors including social links;travel distance and the time. A growing line of research has been devoted to takingadvantage of various effects to improve existing location recommendation methods.However; the temporal influence owns numerous dimensions which deserve to be exploredmore in depth. The subset property comprises a set of homogeneous slots such as an hourof the day; the day of the week; week of the month; month of the year; and so on. In addition;time has other attributes such as the recency which signifies the newly visited locationsversus others.

Leveraging multi-aspect time-related influence in location recommendation,Saeid Hosseini; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract: Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to mine a user's visiting history andfind her/his potentially preferred places. Although location recommendation methods havebeen studied and improved pervasively; the challenges wrt employing various influencesincluding temporal aspect still remain. Inspired by the fact that time includes numerousgranular slots (eg minute; hour; day; week and etc.); in this paper; we define a new problemto perform recommendation through exploiting all diversified temporal factors. In particular;we argue that most existing methods only focus on a limited number of time-related featuresand neglect others. Furthermore; considering a specific granularity (eg time of a day) inrecommendation cannot always apply to each user or each dataset. To address thechallenges; we propose a probabilistic generative model; named after Multi-aspect Time …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.00595,2017,1

Matching user accounts based on user generated content across social networks,Yongjun Li; Zhen Zhang; You Peng; Hongzhi Yin; Quanqing Xu,Abstract Matching user accounts can help us build better users' profiles and benefit manyapplications. It has attracted much attention from both industry and academia. Most ofexisting works are mainly based on rich user profile attributes. However; in many cases; userprofile attributes are unavailable; incomplete or unreliable; either due to the privacy settingsor just because users decline to share their information. This makes the existing schemesquite fragile. Users often share their activities on different social networks. This provides anopportunity to overcome the above problem. We aim to address the problem of useridentification based on User Generated Content (UGC). We first formulate the problem ofuser identification based on UGCs and then propose a UGC-based user identificationmodel. A supervised machine learning based solution is presented.

Discrete Deep Learning for Fast Content-Aware Recommendation,Yan Zhang; Hongzhi Yin; Zi Huang; Xingzhong Du; Guowu Yang; Defu Lian,ABSTRACT Cold-start problem and recommendation efficiency have been regarded as twocrucial challenges in the recommender system. In this paper; we propose a hashing baseddeep learning framework called Discrete Deep Learning (DDL); to map users and items toHamming space; where a user's preference for an item can be efficiently calculated byHamming distance; and this computation scheme significantly improves the efficiency ofonline recommendation. Besides; DDL unifies the user-item interaction information and theitem content information to overcome the issues of data sparsity and cold-start. To be morespecific; to integrate content information into our DDL framework; a deep learning model;Deep Belief Network (DBN); is applied to extract effective item representation from the itemcontent information.

Computing Crowd Consensus with Partial Agreement,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Huynh Huu Viet; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Crowdsourcing has been widely established as a means to enable human computation atlarge-scale; in particular for tasks that require manual labelling of large sets of data items.Answers obtained from heterogeneous crowd workers are aggregated to obtain a robustresult. However; existing methods for answer aggregation are designed for discrete tasks;where answers are given as a single label per item. In this paper; we consider partial-agreement tasks that are common in many applications such as image tagging anddocument annotation; where items are assigned sets of labels. Common approaches for theaggregation of partial-agreement answers either (i) reduce the problem to several instancesof an aggregation problem for discrete tasks or (ii) consider each label independently.

An important branch of the study is to achieve user linkage with spatio-temporaldata generated by the ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices. The main task in this problem istwofold; ie; how to extract the representative features of a user; how to measure thesimilarities between users with the extracted features. To tackle the problem; we propose anovel model STUL (Spatio-Temporal User Linkage) that consists of the following twocomponents. 1) Extract users-spatial features with a density based clustering method; andextract the users-temporal features with the Gaussian Mixture Model. To link user pairs moreprecisely; we assign different weights to the extracted features; by lightening the commonfeatures and highlighting the discriminative features. 2) Propose novel approaches to …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Group Recommender Model Based on Preference Interaction,Wei Zheng; Bohan Li; Yanan Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Xue Li; Donghai Guan; Xiaolin Qin,Abstract With the application of recommender system increasing; the research andapplication of group recommender have been paid more attention. In the course of groupactivities; the unknown preferences of users are often affected by other members of thegroup. However; in the existing group recommender system; this effect is not taken intoaccount.

SPTF: A Scalable Probabilistic Tensor Factorization Model for Semantic-Aware Behavior Prediction,Hongzhi Yin; Hongxu Chen; Xiaoshuai Sun; Hao Wang; Yang Wang; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Abstract—With the rapid rise of various e-commerce and social network platforms; users aregenerating large amounts of heterogenous behavior data; such as purchase history; adding-tofavorite; adding-to-cart and click activities; and this kind of user behavior data is usuallybinary; only reflecting a user's action or inaction (ie; implicit feedback data). Tensorfactorization is a promising means of modeling heterogenous user behaviors bydistinguishing different behavior types. However; ambiguity arises in the interpretation of theunobserved user behavior records that mix both real negative examples and potentialpositive examples. Existing tensor factorization models either ignore unobserved examplesor treat all of them as negative examples; leading to either poor prediction performance orhuge computation cost. In addition; the distribution of positive examples wrt behavior …,2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining(ICDM'17),2017,*
Exploiting detected visual objects for frame-level video filtering,Xingzhong Du; Hongzhi Yin; Zi Huang; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Videos are generated at an unprecedented speed on the web. To improve theefficiency of access; developing new ways to filter the videos becomes a popular researchtopic. One on-going direction is using visual objects to perform frame-level video filtering.Under this direction; existing works create the unique object table and the occurrence tableto maintain the connections between videos and objects. However; the creation process isnot scalable and dynamic because it heavily depends on human labeling. To improve this;we propose to use detected visual objects to create these two tables for frame-level videofiltering. Our study begins with investigating the existing object detection techniques. Afterthat; we find object detection lacks the identification and connection abilities to accomplishthe creation process alone.

A Time and Sentiment Unification Model for Personalized Recommendation,Qinyong Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Hao Wang,Abstract With the rapid development of social media; personalized recommendation hasbecome an essential means to help people discover attractive and interesting items.Intuitively; users buying items online are influenced not only by their preferences and publicattentions; but also by the crowd sentiment (ie; the word of mouth) to the items. Specifically;users are likely to refuse an item whose most reviews are negative from the crowd.Therefore; a good personalized recommendation model also needs to take crowd sentimentinto account; which most current methods do not. In light of this; we propose TSUM; a modelthat jointly integrates time and crowd sentiment; for personalized recommendation in thispaper. TSUM simultaneously models user-oriented topics related to user preferences; time-oriented topics relevant to temporal context; and crowd sentiment towards items.

Time-Constrained Graph Pattern Matching in a Large Temporal Graph,Yanxia Xu; Jinjing Huang; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Hongzhi Yin; Lei Zhao,Abstract Graph pattern matching (GPM) is an important operation on graph computation.Most existing work assumes that query graph or data graph is static; which is contrary to thefact that graphs in real life are intrinsically dynamic. Therefore; in this paper; we propose anew problem of Time-Constrained Graph Pattern Matching (TCGPM) in a large temporalgraph. Different from traditional work; our work deals with temporal graphs rather than aseries of snapshots. Besides; the query graph in TCGPM contains two types of timeconstraints which are helpful for finding more useful subgraphs. To address the problem ofTCGPM; a baseline method and an improved method are proposed. Besides; to furtherimprove the efficiency; two pruning rules are proposed.

Retaining data from streams of social platforms with minimal regret,Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Duong Chi Thang; Hongzhi Yin; Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung,Abstract Today's social platforms; such as Twitter and Facebook; continuously generatemassive volumes of data. The resulting data streams exceed any reasonable limit forpermanent storage; especially since data is often redundant; overlapping; sparse; andgenerally of low value. This calls for means to retain solely a small fraction of the data in anonline manner. In this paper; we propose techniques to effectively decide which data toretain; such that the induced loss of information; the regret of neglecting certain data; isminimized. These techniques enable not only efficient processing of massive streamingdata; but are also adaptive and address the dynamic nature of social media.
