Keyword search in spatial databases: Towards searching by document,Dongxiang Zhang; Yeow Meng Chee; Anirban Mondal; Anthony KH Tung; Masaru Kitsuregawa,This work addresses a novel spatial keyword query called the m-closest keywords (mCK)query. Given a database of spatial objects; each tuple is associated with some descriptiveinformation represented in the form of keywords. The mCK query aims to find the spatiallyclosest tuples which match m user-specified keywords. Given a set of keywords from adocument; mCK query can be very useful in geotagging the document by comparing thekeywords to other geotagged documents in a database. To answer mCK queries efficiently;we introduce a new index called the bR*-tree; which is an extension of the R*-tree. Based onbR*-tree; we exploit a priori-based search strategies to effectively reduce the search space.We also propose two monotone constraints; namely the distance mutex and keyword mutex;as our a priori properties to facilitate effective pruning.

Locating mapped resources in web 2.0,Dongxiang Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Mapping mashups are emerging Web 2.0 applications in which data objects such as blogs;photos and videos from different sources are combined and marked in a map using APIs thatare released by online mapping solutions such as Google and Yahoo Maps. These objectsare typically associated with a set of tags capturing the embedded semantic and a set ofcoordinates indicating their geographical locations. Traditional web resource searchingstrategies are not effective in such an environment due to the lack of the gazetteer context inthe tags. Instead; a better alternative approach is to locate an object by tag matching.However; the number of tags associated with each object is typically small; making it difficultfor an object to capture the complete semantics in the query objects. In this paper; we focuson the fundamental application of locating geographical resources and propose an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,124
Effective multi-modal retrieval based on stacked auto-encoders,Wei Wang; Beng Chin Ooi; Xiaoyan Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables seamlessinformation retrieval from various types of media. For example; users can simply snap amovie poster to search relevant reviews and trailers. To solve the problem; a set of mappingfunctions are learned to project high-dimensional features extracted from data of differentmedia types into a common low-dimensional space so that metric distance measures can beapplied. In this paper; we propose an effective mapping mechanism based on deep learning(ie; stacked auto-encoders) for multi-modal retrieval. Mapping functions are learned byoptimizing a new objective function; which captures both intra-modal and inter-modalsemantic relationships of data from heterogeneous sources effectively. Compared withprevious works which require a substantial amount of prior knowledge such as similarity …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,82
Scalable top-k spatial keyword search,Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this big data era; huge amounts of spatial documents have been generatedeveryday through various location based services. Top-k spatial keyword search is animportant approach to exploring useful information from a spatial database. It retrieves kdocuments based on a ranking function that takes into account both textual relevance(similarity between the query and document keywords) and spatial relevance (distancebetween the query and document locations). Various hybrid indexes have been proposed inrecent years which mainly combine the R-tree and the inverted index so that spatial pruningand textual pruning can be executed simultaneously. However; the rapid growth in datavolume poses significant challenges to existing methods in terms of the index maintenancecost and query processing time. In this paper; we propose a scalable integrated inverted …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on extending database technology,2013,71
Effective deep learning-based multi-modal retrieval,Wei Wang; Xiaoyan Yang; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables seamlessinformation retrieval from various types of media. For example; users can simply snap amovie poster to search for relevant reviews and trailers. The mainstream solution to theproblem is to learn a set of mapping functions that project data from different modalities intoa common metric space in which conventional indexing schemes for high-dimensionalspace can be applied. Since the effectiveness of the mapping functions plays an essentialrole in improving search quality; in this paper; we exploit deep learning techniques to learneffective mapping functions. In particular; we first propose a general learning objective thateffectively captures both intramodal and intermodal semantic relationships of data fromheterogeneous sources. Given the general objective; we propose two learning algorithms …,The VLDB Journal,2016,41
Processing spatial keyword query as a top-k aggregation query,Dongxiang Zhang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract We examine the spatial keyword search problem to retrieve objects of interest thatare ranked based on both their spatial proximity to the query location as well as the textualrelevance of the object's keywords. Existing solutions for the problem are based on eitherusing a combination of textual and spatial indexes or using specialized hybrid indexes thatintegrate the indexing of both textual and spatial attribute values. In this paper; we propose anew approach that is based on modeling the problem as a top-k aggregation problem whichenables the design of a scalable and efficient solution that is based on the ubiquitousinverted list index. Our performance study demonstrates that our approach outperforms thestate-of-the-art hybrid methods by a wide margin.,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,38
Real-time targeted influence maximization for online advertisements,Yuchen Li; Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Advertising in social network has become a multi-billion-dollar industry. A mainchallenge is to identify key influencers who can effectively contribute to the dissemination ofinformation. Although the influence maximization problem; which finds a seed set of k mostinfluential users based on certain propagation models; has been well studied; it is not target-aware and cannot be directly applied to online advertising. In this paper; we propose a newproblem; named Keyword-Based Targeted Influence Maximization (KB-TIM); to find a seedset that maximizes the expected influence over users who are relevant to a givenadvertisement. To solve the problem; we propose a sampling technique based on weightedreverse influence set and achieve an approximation ratio of (1− 1/e− ε). To meet the instant-speed requirement; we propose two disk-based solutions that improve the query …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,35
Scalable multimedia retrieval by deep learning hashing with relative similarity learning,Lianli Gao; Jingkuan Song; Fuhao Zou; Dongxiang Zhang; Jie Shao,Abstract Learning-based hashing methods are becoming the mainstream for approximatescalable multimedia retrieval. They consist of two main components: hash codes learning fortraining data and hash functions learning for new data points. Tremendous efforts have beendevoted to designing novel methods for these two components; ie; supervised andunsupervised methods for learning hash codes; and different models for inferring hashingfunctions. However; there is little work integrating supervised and unsupervised hash codeslearning into a single framework. Moreover; the hash function learning component is usuallybased on hand-crafted visual features extracted from the training images. The performanceof a content-based image retrieval system crucially depends on the feature representationand such hand-crafted visual features may degrade the accuracy of the hash functions.

An efficient publish/subscribe index for e-commerce databases,Dongxiang Zhang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Many of today's publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems have been designed to copewith a large volume of subscriptions and high event arrival rate (velocity). However; in manynovel applications (such as e-commerce); there is an increasing variety of items; each withdifferent attributes. This leads to a very high-dimensional and sparse database that existingpub/sub systems can no longer support effectively. In this paper; we propose an efficient in-memory index that is scalable to the volume and update of subscriptions; the arrival rate ofevents and the variety of subscribable attributes. The index is also extensible to supportcomplex scenarios such as prefix/suffix filtering and regular expression matching. Weconduct extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and two real datasets (AOL query logand Ebay products). The results demonstrate the superiority of our index over state-of-the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,29
Location-aware pub/sub system: When continuous moving queries meet dynamic event streams,Long Guo; Dongxiang Zhang; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhifeng Bao,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new location-aware pub/sub system; Elaps; thatcontinuously monitors moving users subscribing to dynamic event streams from socialmedia and E-commerce applications. Users are notified instantly when there is a matchingevent nearby. To the best of our knowledge; Elaps is the first to take into account continuousmoving queries against dynamic event streams. Like existing works on continuous movingquery processing; Elaps employs the concept of safe region to reduce communicationoverhead. However; unlike existing works which assume data from publishers are static;updates to safe regions may be triggered by newly arrived events. In Elaps; we develop aconcept called\textit {impact region} that allows us to identify whether a safe region isaffected by newly arrived events. Moreover; we propose a novel cost model to optimize …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,28
Supervised hashing with pseudo labels for scalable multimedia retrieval,Jingkuan Song; Lianli Gao; Yan Yan; Dongxiang Zhang; Nicu Sebe,Abstract There is an increasing interest in using hash codes for efficient multimedia retrievaland data storage. The hash functions are learned in such a way that the hash codes canpreserve essential properties of the original space or the label information. Then theHamming distance of the hash codes can approximate the data similarity. Existing workshave demonstrated the success of many supervised hashing models. However; labelingdata is time and labor consuming; especially for scalable datasets. In order to utilize thesupervised hashing models to improve the discriminative power of hash codes; we proposea Supervised Hashing with Pseudo Labels (SHPL) which uses the cluster centers of thetraining data to generate pseudo labels; based on which the hash codes can be generatedusing the criteria of supervised hashing. More specifically; we utilize linear discriminant …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,26
Hashfile: An efficient index structure for multimedia data,Dongxiang Zhang; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Anthony KH Tung,Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional space is an essential query in manymultimedia retrieval applications. Due to the curse of dimensionality; existing indexstructures might perform even worse than a simple sequential scan of data when answeringexact NN query. To improve the efficiency of NN search; locality sensitive hashing (LSH) andits variants have been proposed to find approximate NN. They adopt hash functions that canpreserve the Euclidean distance so that similar objects have a high probability of colliding inthe same bucket. Given a query object; candidate for the query result is obtained byaccessing the points that are located in the same bucket. To improve the precision; eachhash table is associated with m hash functions to recursively hash the data points intosmaller buckets and remove the false positives. On the other hand; multiple hash tables …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,21
Efficient spatial keyword search in trajectory databases,Gao Cong; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: An increasing amount of trajectory data is being annotated with text descriptions tobetter capture the semantics associated with locations. The fusion of spatial locations andtext descriptions in trajectories engenders a new type of top-$ k $ queries that take intoaccount both aspects. Each trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatiallocations associated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\lambda $ and a keywordset $\psi $; a top-$ k $ query returns $ k $ trajectories whose text descriptions cover thekeywords $\psi $ and that have the shortest match distance. To the best of our knowledge;previous research on querying trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data withoutany text description; and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$ k $ queries ontrajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing top-$ k …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2880,2012,20
Nearest group queries,Dongxiang Zhang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract k nearest neighbor (kNN) search is an important problem in a vast number ofapplications; including clustering; pattern recognition; image retrieval and recommendationsystems. It finds k elements from a data source D that are closest to a given query point q ina metric space. In this paper; we extend kNN query to retrieve closest elements from multipledata sources. This new type of query is named k nearest group (kNG) query; which finds kgroups of elements that are closest to q with each group containing one object from eachdata source. kNG query is useful in many location based services. To efficiently process kNGqueries; we propose a baseline algorithm using R-tree as well as an improved version usingHilbert R-tree. We also study a variant of kNG query; named kNG Join; which is analagous tokNN Join. Given a set of query points Q; kNG Join returns k nearest groups for each point …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,17
Towards enhancing the last-mile delivery: An effective crowd-tasking model with scalable solutions,Yuan Wang; Dongxiang Zhang; Qing Liu; Fumin Shen; Loo Hay Lee,Abstract In urban logistics; the last-mile delivery from the warehouse to the consumer's homehas become more and more challenging with the continuous growth of E-commerce. Itrequires elaborate planning and scheduling to minimize the global traveling cost; but oftenresults in unattended delivery as most consumers are away from home. In this paper; wepropose an effective large-scale mobile crowd-tasking model in which a large pool of citizenworkers are used to perform the last-mile delivery. To efficiently solve the model; weformulate it as a network min-cost flow problem and propose various pruning techniques thatcan dramatically reduce the network size. Comprehensive experiments were conducted withSingapore and Beijing datasets. The results show that our solution can support real-timedelivery optimization in the large-scale mobile crowd-sourcing problem.,Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2016,13
Hierarchical lstm with adjusted temporal attention for video captioning,Jingkuan Song; Zhao Guo; Lianli Gao; Wu Liu; Dongxiang Zhang; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract: Recent progress has been made in using attention based encoder-decoderframework for video captioning. However; most existing decoders apply the attentionmechanism to every generated word including both visual words (eg;" gun" and" shooting")and non-visual words (eg" the";" a"). However; these non-visual words can be easilypredicted using natural language model without considering visual signals or attention.Imposing attention mechanism on non-visual words could mislead and decrease the overallperformance of video captioning. To address this issue; we propose a hierarchical LSTMwith adjusted temporal attention (hLSTMat) approach for video captioning. Specifically; theproposed framework utilizes the temporal attention for selecting specific frames to predict therelated words; while the adjusted temporal attention is for deciding whether to depend on …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.01231,2017,12
Personal recommendation using deep recurrent neural networks in NetEase,Sai Wu; Weichao Ren; Chengchao Yu; Gang Chen; Dongxiang Zhang; Jingbo Zhu,Each user session in an e-commerce system can be modeled as a sequence of web pages;indicating how the user interacts with the system and makes his/her purchase. A typicalrecommendation approach; eg; Collaborative Filtering; generates its results at the beginningof each session; listing the most likely purchased items. However; such approach fails toexploit current viewing history of the user and hence; is unable to provide a real-timecustomized recommendation service. In this paper; we build a deep recurrent neuralnetwork to address the problem. The network tracks how users browse the website usingmultiple hidden layers. Each hidden layer models how the combinations of webpages areaccessed and in what order. To reduce the processing cost; the network only records a finitenumber of states; while the old states collapse into a single history state.

Matrix tri-factorization with manifold regularizations for zero-shot learning,Xing Xu; Fumin Shen; Yang Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Heng Tao Shen; Jingkuan Song,Abstract Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects of unseen classes with availabletraining data from another set of seen classes. Existing solutions are focused on exploringknowledge transfer via an intermediate semantic embedding (eg; attributes) shared betweenseen and unseen classes. In this paper; we propose a novel projection framework based onmatrix tri-factorization with manifold regularizations. Specifically; we learn the semanticembedding projection by decomposing the visual feature matrix under the guidance ofsemantic embedding and class label matrices. By additionally introducing manifoldregularizations on visual data and semantic embeddings; the learned projection caneffectively capture the geometrical manifold structure residing in both visual and semanticspaces. To avoid the projection domain shift problem; we devise an effective prediction …,CVPR,2017,11
CANDS: continuous optimal navigation via distributed stream processing,Dingyu Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan; Jian Cao; Frédéric Le Mouël,Abstract Shortest path query over a dynamic road network is a prominent problem for theoptimization of real-time traffic systems. Existing solutions rely either on a centralized indexsystem with tremendous pre-computation overhead; or on a distributed graph processingsystem such as Pregel that requires much synchronization effort. However; the performanceof these systems degenerates with frequent route path updates caused by continuous trafficcondition change. In this paper; we build CANDS; a distributed stream processing platformfor continuous optimal shortest path queries. It provides an asynchronous solution toanswering a large quantity of shortest path queries. It is able to efficiently detect affectedpaths and adjust their paths in the face of traffic updates. Moreover; the affected paths canbe quickly updated to the optimal solutions throughout the whole navigation process …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,11
Marcopolo: a community system for sharing and integrating travel information on maps,Yueguo Chen; Su Chen; Yu Gu; Mei Hui; Feng Li; Chen Liu; Liangxu Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Xiaoyan Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Yuan Zhou,Abstract The tagging technique has been widely applied in existing Web 2.0 systems; whereusers label resources with tags for effective classification and efficient retrieval of resources.Location-aware geographical tags (geo-tags) are required if users want to mark location-sensitive resources to digital maps. Large volumes of different kinds of user-created tagspose challenges to the effective organization of community resources using tags. Issuessuch as guaranteeing the quality of tags and supporting various tag-based queries emerge.In this demo; we present MarcoPolo; a Web 2.0 community system that allows users todefine the hierarchical textual geo-tags and mark resources to a map using geo-tags.Statistical and feedback mechanisms are applied to guarantee the quality of tags (includinggeo-tags).

Unifying virtual and physical worlds: Learning toward local and global consistency,Xiang Wang; Liqiang Nie; Xuemeng Song; Dongxiang Zhang; Tat-Seng Chua,Abstract Event-based social networking services; such as Meetup; are capable of linkingonline virtual interactions to offline physical activities. Compared to mono online socialnetworking services (eg; Twitter and Google+); such dual networks provide a completepicture of users' online and offline behaviors that more often than not are compatible andcomplementary. In the light of this; we argue that joint learning over dual networks offers us abetter way to comprehensively understand user behaviors and their underlyingorganizational principles. Despite its value; few efforts have been dedicated to jointlyconsidering the following factors within a unified model:(1) local user contextualization;(2)global structure coherence; and (3) effectiveness evaluation. Toward this end; we propose anovel dual clustering model for community detection over dual networks to jointly model …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,9
Context-aware advertisement recommendation for high-speed social news feeding,Yuchen Li; Dongxiang Zhang; Ziquan Lan; Kian-Lee Tan,Social media advertising is a multi-billion dollar market and has become the major revenuesource for Facebook and Twitter. To deliver ads to potentially interested users; these socialnetwork platforms learn a prediction model for each user based on their personal interests.However; as user interests often evolve slowly; the user may end up receiving repetitive ads.In this paper; we propose a context-aware advertising framework that takes into account therelatively static personal interests as well as the dynamic news feed from friends to drivegrowth in the ad click-through rate. To meet the real-time requirement; we first propose anonline retrieval strategy that finds k most relevant ads matching the dynamic context when aread operation is triggered. To avoid frequent retrieval when the context varies little; wepropose a safe region method to quickly determine whether the top-k ads of a user are …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,8
Elaps: An efficient location-aware pub/sub system,Long Guo; Lu Chen; Dongxiang Zhang; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhifeng Bao,The prevalence of social networks and mobile devices has facilitated the real-timedissemination of local events such as sales; shows and exhibitions. To explore nearbyevents; mobile users can query a location based search engine for the desired data.However; operating under such a pull based model means that users may miss interestingevents (because no explicit queries are issued) or processing/communication overheadsmay be high (because users have to continuously issue queries). In this demo; we presentElaps; an efficient location-aware publish/subscribe system that can effectively disseminateinteresting events to moving users. Elaps is based on the push model and notifies mobileusers instantly whenever there is a matching event around their locations.

Influence maximization in trajectory databases,Long Guo; Dongxiang Zhang; Gao Cong; Wei Wu; Kian-Lee Tan,In this paper; we study a novel problem of influence maximization in trajectory databasesthat is very useful in precise location-aware advertising. It finds k best trajectories to beattached with a given advertisement and maximizes the expected influence among a largegroup of audience. We show that the problem is NP-hard and propose both exact andapproximate solutions to find the best set of trajectories. In the exact solution; we devise anexpansion-based framework that enumerates trajectory combinations in a best-first mannerand propose three types of upper bound estimation techniques to facilitate early termination.In addition; we propose a novel trajectory index to reduce the influence calculation cost.

A cross-service travel engine for trip planning,Gang Chen; Chen Liu; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Shanshan Ying; Anthony Tung; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract The online travel services and resources are far from well organized and integrated.Trip planning is still a laborious job requiring interaction with a combination of services suchas travel guides; personal travel blogs; map services and public transportation to piecetogether an itinerary. To facilitate this process; we have designed a cross-service travelengine for trip planners. Our system seamlessly and semantically integrates various types oftravel services and resources based on a geographical ontology. We also built a user-friendly visualization tool for travellers to conveniently browse and design personalitineraries on Google Maps.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,5
Crew: cross-modal resource searching by exploiting wikipedia,Chen Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung; Dongxiang Zhang,Abstract In Web 2.0; users have generated and shared massive amounts of resources invarious media formats; such as news; blogs; audios; photos and videos. The abundanceand diversity of the resources call for better integration to improve the accessibility. Astraightforward approach is to link the resources via tags so that resources from differentmodals sharing the same tag can be connected as a graph structure. This naturallymotivates a new kind of information retrieval system; named cross-modal resource search; inwhich given a query object from any modal; all the related resources from other modals canbe retrieved in a convenient manner. However; due to the tag homonym and synonym; suchan approach returns results of low quality because resources with the same tag but notsemantically related will be directly connected as well.

A general and parallel platform for mining co-movement patterns over large-scale trajectories,Qi Fan; Dongxiang Zhang; Huayu Wu; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Discovering co-movement patterns from large-scale trajectory databases is animportant mining task and has a wide spectrum of applications. Previous studies haveidentified several types of interesting co-movement patterns and show-cased theirusefulness. In this paper; we make two key contributions to this research field. First; wepropose a more general co-movement pattern to unify those defined in the past literature.Second; we propose two types of parallel and scalable frameworks and deploy them onApache Spark. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work to mine co-movementpatterns in real life trajectory databases with hundreds of millions of points.

Distribution-aware crowdsourced entity collection,Ju Fan; Zhewei Wei; Dongxiang Zhang; Jingru Yang; Xiaoyong Du,The problem of crowdsourced entity collection solicits people (aka workers) to completemissing data in a database and has witnessed many applications in knowledge basecompletion and enterprise data collection. Although previous studies have attempted toaddress the “open world” challenge of crowdsourced entity collection; they do not pay muchattention to the “distribution” of the collected entities. Evidently; in many real applications;users may have distribution requirements on the collected entities; eg; even spatialdistribution when collecting points-of-interest.

A general framework to resolve the MisMatch problem in XML keyword search,Zhifeng Bao; Yong Zeng; Tok Wang Ling; Dongxiang Zhang; Guoliang Li; HV Jagadish,Abstract When users issue a query to a database; they have expectations about the results.If what they search for is unavailable in the database; the system will return an empty resultor; worse; erroneous mismatch results. We call this problem the MisMatch problem. In thispaper; we solve the MisMatch problem in the context of XML keyword search. Our solution isbased on two novel concepts that we introduce: target node type and Distinguishability.Target Node Type represents the type of node a query result intends to match; andDistinguishability is used to measure the importance of the query keywords. Using theseconcepts; we develop a low-cost post-processing algorithm on the results of queryevaluation to detect the MisMatch problem and generate helpful suggestions to users. Ourapproach has three noteworthy features:(1) for queries with the MisMatch problem; it …,The VLDB Journal,2015,4
Data-Driven Answer Selection in Community QA Systems,Liqiang Nie; Xiaochi Wei; Dongxiang Zhang; Xiang Wang; Zhipeng Gao; Yi Yang,Finding similar questions from historical archives has been applied to question answering;with well theoretical underpinnings and great practical success. Nevertheless; eachquestion in the returned candidate pool often associates with multiple answers; and henceusers have to painstakingly browse a lot before finding the correct one. To alleviate suchproblem; we present a novel scheme to rank answer candidates via pairwise comparisons.In particular; it consists of one offline learning component and one online search component.In the offline learning component; we first automatically establish the positive; negative; andneutral training samples in terms of preference pairs guided by our data-drivenobservations. We then present a novel model to jointly incorporate these three types oftraining samples. The closed-form solution of this model is derived.

Discovering your selling points: Personalized social influential tags exploration,Yuchen Li; Ju Fan; Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Social influence has attracted significant attention owing to the prevalence of socialnetworks (SNs). In this paper; we study a new social influence problem; called personalizedsocial tags exploration (PITEX); to help any user in the SN explore how she influences thenetwork. Given a target user; it finds a size-k tag set that maximizes this user's socialinfluence. We prove the problem is NP-hard to be approximated within any constant ratio. Tosolve it; we introduce a sampling-based framework; which has an approximation ratio of 1-εover 1+ ε with high probabilistic guarantee. To speedup the computation; we devise moreefficient sampling techniques and propose best-effort exploration to quickly prune tag setswith small influence. To further enable instant exploration; we devise a novel index structureand develop effective pruning and materialization techniques.

L2; p-norm and sample constraint based feature selection and classification for AD diagnosis,Mingxing Zhang; Yang Yang; Hanwang Zhang; Fumin Shen; Dongxiang Zhang,Abstract Recent studies have witnessed the effectiveness of L 2; 1 L 2; 1-norm basedmethods on AD/MCI diagnosis. Nonetheless; most of them suffer from the following threemain problems:(1) L 2; 1-norm L 2; 1-norm based loss function does not take into accountdifferent distances between target labels and prediction values;(2) L 2; 1-norm L 2; 1-normbased feature selection does not possess sufficient flexibility to adapt to different types ofdata sources and select more informative features;(3) intrinsic correlation between theprocesses of feature selection and classification (or regression) are inevitably ignored.

A data-driven and optimal bus scheduling model with time-dependent traffic and demand,Yuan Wang; Dongxiang Zhang; Lu Hu; Yang Yang; Loo Hay Lee,Urban bus companies have collected a tremendous amount of travel data from passengersin the past years. In spite of great value for bus schedule optimization; these data have notbeen fully exploited. In this paper; we leverage hundreds of millions of bus transactionrecords; generated when passengers board and alight; to infer time-dependent traffic andcustomer demand. When the traffic and demand information are available; we build anoptimal model to schedule the departure time of each bus service with the objective ofminimizing the average waiting time. Experimental results show that compared with theexisting bus scheduling system; our model can help reduce the waiting time by a widemargin.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017,2
Targeted advertising in public transportation systems with quantitative evaluation,Dongxiang Zhang; Long Guo; Liqiang Nie; Jie Shao; Sai Wu; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract In spite of vast business potential; targeted advertising in public transportationsystems is a grossly unexplored research area. For instance; SBS Transit in Singapore canreach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than&dollar; 35 million. To bridge the gap; we propose a probabilistic data model that capturesthe motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of anadvertisement among the passengers. In particular; we leverage hundreds of millions ofbus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as theextent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model; we study a top-kretrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation; which acts as a primitive operator tosupport various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,2

Many commercial media companies have used Twitter as aneffective online tool to broadcast breaking news. Consequently; the tweets are organized inchronological order. In this paper; we investigate the tweet exhibition problem from a newperspective. We treat Twitter as an important source of knowledge gaining and exploit itssemantic attributes. In particular; we focus on extracting and distilling knowledge from tweetsand proposing a new organization and visualization tool to exhibit the tweets in a semanticmanner. We conducted our experiments on Amazon Turk and the user feedback from crowddemonstrated the effectiveness of our new Twitter visualization tool.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2015,2
A graph based method for constructing popular routes with check-ins,Gang Hu; Jie Shao; Zhiyang Ni; Dongxiang Zhang,Abstract Location-based social networks allow people to share their experience of trips bycheck-in or other ways. Check-in records normally contain two aspects of information; one issemantic information (in the form of text) and the other is location information (in the form ofcoordinate). In this paper; we present a popular route construction method named GRIDbased on collective knowledge. Firstly; we mine the check-in records which contain theroute's attributes to divide the whole space into regions and find the POIs of each region.Secondly; we use the location trajectory information of check-ins to infer the connection ofPOIs in the same region and the connection between regions. Finally; according to user-specified query locations a visiting sequence is determined by calculating the probability ofeach query location.

Event Early Embedding: Predicting Event Volume Dynamics at Early Stage,Zhiwei Liu; Yang Yang; Zi Huang; Fumin Shen; Dongxiang Zhang; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Social media has become one of the most credible sources for deliveringmessages; breaking news; as well as events. Predicting the future dynamics of an event at avery early stage is significantly valuable; eg; helping company anticipate marketing trendsbefore the event becomes mature. However; this prediction is non-trivial because a) socialevents always stay with" noise''under the same topic and b) the information obtained at itsearly stage is too sparse and limited to support an accurate prediction. In order to overcomethese two problems; in this paper; we design an event early embedding model (EEEM) thatcan 1) extract social events from noise; 2) find the previous similar events; and 3) predictfuture dynamics of a new event. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale datasetof Twitter data demonstrate the capacity of our model on extract events and the promising …,Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2017,1
Distributed shortest path query processing on dynamic road networks,Dongxiang Zhang; Dingyu Yang; Yuan Wang; Kian-Lee Tan; Jian Cao; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Shortest path query processing on dynamic road networks is a fundamentalcomponent for real-time navigation systems. In the face of an enormous volume of customerdemand from Uber and similar apps; it is desirable to study distributed shortest path queryprocessing that can be deployed on elastic and fault-tolerant cloud platforms. In this paper;we combine the merits of distributed streaming computing systems and lightweight indexingto build an efficient shortest path query processing engine on top of Yahoo S4. We proposetwo types of asynchronous communication algorithms for early termination. One is first-in-first-out message propagation with certain optimizations; and the other is prioritizedmessage propagation with the help of navigational intelligence.

Processing Long Queries Against Short Text: Top-k Advertisement Matching in News Stream Applications,Dongxiang Zhang; Yuchen Li; Ju Fan; Lianli Gao; Fumin Shen; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Many real applications in real-time news stream advertising call for efficientprocessing of long queries against short text. In such applications; dynamic news feeds areregarded as queries to match against an advertisement (ad) database for retrieving the kmost relevant ads. The existing approaches to keyword retrieval cannot work well in thissearch scenario when queries are triggered at a very high frequency. To address theproblem; we introduce new techniques to significantly improve search performance. First; wedevise a two-level partitioning for tight upper bound estimation and a lazy evaluationscheme to delay full evaluation of unpromising candidates; which can bring three to fourtimes performance boosting in a database with 7 million ads. Second; we propose a novelrank-aware block-oriented inverted index to further improve performance. In this index …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,1
Compact Indexing and Judicious Searching for Billion-Scale Microblog Retrieval,Dongxiang Zhang; Liqiang Nie; Huanbo Luan; Kian-Lee Tan; Tat-Seng Chua; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract In this article; we study the problem of efficient top-k disjunctive query processing ina huge microblog dataset. In terms of compact indexing; we categorize the keywords intorare terms and common terms based on inverse document frequency (idf) and proposetailored block-oriented organization to save memory consumption. In terms of fast searching;we classify the queries into three types based on term category and judiciously design anefficient search algorithm for each type. We conducted extensive experiments on a billion-scale Twitter dataset and examined the performance with both simple and more advancedranking functions. The results showed that with much smaller index size; our searchalgorithm achieves a factor of 2--3 times faster speedup over state-of-the-art solutions inboth ranking scenarios.,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,1
An online approach for direction-based trajectory compression with error bound guarantee,Bingqing Ke; Jie Shao; Yi Zhang; Dongxiang Zhang; Yang Yang,Abstract With the increasing usage of GPS-enabled devices which can record users' travelexperiences; moving object trajectories are collected in many applications. Raw trajectorydata can be of large volume but storage is limited; and direction-based compression topreserve the skeleton of a trajectory became popular recently. In addition; real-timeapplications and constrained resources often require online processing of incoming datainstantaneously. To address this challenge; in this paper we first investigate two approachesextended from Douglas-Peucker and Greedy Deviation algorithms respectively; which aretwo most popular algorithms for trajectory compression.

Efficient Bulk Loading to Accelerate Spatial Keyword Queries,Dongsheng Li; Jinkun Pan; Jiaxin Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Dongxiang Zhang,With the fast development of location-based services and geo-tagging; spatial keywordqueries that retrieve objects satisfying both spatial and keyword conditions are gaining inprevalence. A hybrid index that integrates a spatial index (eg; the R-tree or its variations)with a keyword filter offers a promising approach for processing such queries efficiently.However; it is still an open problem on how a hybrid index can be effectively constructedfrom scratch. The state-of-the-art bulk loading algorithms for the R-tree consider only spatialrelationship; and cannot be employed for the hybrid index. In this paper; we propose a newbulk loading algorithm; named TPA; which constructs a hybrid index top-down. TPA utilizesa two-phase method to construct the children of nodes at each level of the hybrid index;taking both spatial and keyword information into consideration; and thus optimizes the …,Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS); 2013 International Conference on,2013,1
Augmented keyword search on spatial entity databases,Dongxiang Zhang; Yuchen Li; Xin Cao; Jie Shao; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new type of query that augments the spatial keywordsearch with an additional boolean expression constraint. The query is issued against acorpus of structured or semi-structured spatial entities and is very useful in applications likemobile search and targeted location-aware advertising. We devise three types of indexingand filtering strategies. First; we utilize the hybrid IR^ 2 IR 2-tree and propose a novelhashing scheme for efficient pruning. Second; we propose an inverted index-based solution;named BE-Inv; that is more cache concious and exhibits great pruning power for booleanexpression matching. Our third method; named SKB-Inv; adopts a novel two-levelpartitioning scheme to organize the spatial entities into inverted lists and effectively facilitatethe pruning in the spatial; textual; and boolean expression dimensions.

The state-of-the-art performance was achieved by enumerating all thepossible expressions from the quantities in the text and customizing a scoring function toidentify the one with the maximum probability. However; it incurs exponential search spacewith the number of quantities and beam search has to be applied to trade accuracy forefficiency. In this paper; we make the first attempt of applying deep reinforcement learning tosolve arithmetic word problems. The motivation is that deep Q-network has witnessedsuccess in solving various problems with big search space and achieves promisingperformance in terms of both accuracy and running time.

An Iterative Refinement Framework for Image Document Binarization with Bhattacharyya Similarity Measure,Ning Liu; Dongxiang Zhang; Xing Xu; Wenju Liu; Dengfeng Ke; Long Guo; Shengkun Shi; Hui Liu; Lijiang Chen,Background noise and illumination condition are two primary factors degrading theperformance of document image binarization. In this paper; we propose an iterativerefinement framework to support robust binarization. Initially; an input image is transformedinto a Bhattacharyya similarity matrix with Gaussian kernel; which is subsequently convertedinto a binary image using maximum entropy classifier. Then; we adopt the run-lengthhistogram to estimate the character stroke width; an important indicator to determine thelength of filter window. After noise elimination; the output image is used for the next round ofrefinement and the process terminates when the estimated stroke width is stable. Extensiveexperiments were conducted on the standard DIBCO datasets as well as a new benchmarkharvested from our user query log.

Robust Math Formula Recognition in Degraded Chinese Document Images,Ning Liu; Dongxiang Zhang; Xing Xu; Long Guo; Lijiang Chen; Wenju Liu; Dengfeng Ke,In this paper; we study the problem of math formula recognition (MFR) in degraded Chinesedocument images. Compared to traditional optical character recognition (OCR); the MFRproblem brings new challenges in terms of character segmentation and structural analysis;especially in degraded images. To tackle these issues; we propose an over-segmentationstrategy to split and recognize adhesive formula elements based on convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN). In addition; we propose a hierarchical framework for formula structureanalysis that constructs the formula in a top-down manner to iteratively split the regions intorecognizable units. Due to the lack of degraded Chinese document images with mathformulas in the community; we also harvest a diverse ground-truth dataset containing 100images submitted from our system users.

Towards Automatic Construction of Diverse; High-quality Image Dataset,Yazhou Yao; Jian Zhang; Fumin Shen; Dongxiang Zhang; Zhenmin Tang; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract: The availability of labeled image datasets has been shown critical for high-levelimage understanding; which continuously drives the progress of feature designing andmodels developing. However; constructing labeled image datasets is laborious andmonotonous. To eliminate manual annotation; in this work; we propose a novel imagedataset construction framework by employing multiple textual metadata. We aim at collectingdiverse and accurate images for given queries from the Web. Specifically; we formulatenoisy textual metadata removing and noisy images filtering as a multi-view and multi-instance learning problem separately. Our proposed approach not only improves theaccuracy but also enhances the diversity of the selected images. To verify the effectivenessof our proposed approach; we construct an image dataset with 100 categories. The …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.06495,2017,*
Discovering Newsworthy Themes from Sequenced Data: A Step Towards Computational Journalism,Qi Fan; Yuchen Li; Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan,Automatic discovery of newsworthy themes from sequenced data can relieve journalists frommanually poring over a large amount of data in order to find interesting news. In this paper;we propose a novel $ k $-Sketch query that aims to find $ k $ striking streaks to bestsummarize a subject. Our scoring function takes into account streak strikingness and streakcoverage at the same time. We study the $ k $-Sketch query processing in both offline andonline scenarios; and propose various streak-level pruning techniques to find strikingcandidates. Among those candidates; we then develop approximate methods to discover the$ k $ most representative streaks with theoretical bounds.

An Efficient Online Approach for Direction-Preserving Trajectory Simplification with Interval Bounds,Bingqing Ke; Jie Shao; Dongxiang Zhang,The prevalence of GPS devices has facilitated collection of large-scale trajectories. Freshpositions of moving objects can be sampled periodically and sent to servers for dataanalytics and query processing. Online trajectory simplification is a compression task usuallyconducted at the sensor side and serves as a key component to reduce networkcommunication overhead. In this paper; we study a new trajectory simplification problemwhich is direction-preserving and works in an online fashion. An efficient simplificationalgorithm is proposed; which is guaranteed to be error-bounded and achieves O (n) timeand O (1) space complexity.

Preserving-Ignoring Transformation Based Index for Approximate k Nearest Neighbor Search,Gang Hu; Jie Shao; Dongxiang Zhang; Yang Yang; Heng Tao Shen,Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variants are widely used for approximate kNN (knearest neighbor) search in high-dimensional space. The success of these techniqueslargely depends on the ability of preserving kNN information. Unfortunately; LSH onlyprovides a high probability that nearby points in the original space are projected into nearbyregion in a new space. This potentially makes many false positives and false negativesresulting from unrelated points. Many extensions of LSH aim to alleviate the above issue byimproving the distance preserving ability. In this paper; we abound improving LSH functionbut propose a novel idea to enhance the performance by transforming the original data to anew space before applying LSH.

From Raw Footprints to Personal Interests: Bridging the Semantic Gap via Trip Intention Aggregation,Long Guo; Dongxiang Zhang; Huayu Wu; Bin Cui; Kian-Lee Tan,User-generated trajectories (UGT); such as GPS footprints from wearable devices or travelrecords from bus companies; capture rich information of human mobility and urbandynamics in the offline world. In this paper; our objective is to enrich these raw footprints anddiscover the users' personal interests by utilizing the semantic information contained in thespatial-and temporal-aware user-generated contents (STUGC) published in the onlineworld. We design a novel probabilistic framework named CO 2 to connect the offline worldwith the online world in order to discover the users' interests directly from their raw footprintsin UGT. In particular; we first propose a latent probabilistic generative model named STLDAto infer the intention attached with each trip; and then aggregate the extracted trip intentionsto discover the users' personal interests.

Personalized semantic trajectory privacy preservation through trajectory reconstruction,Yan Dai; Jie Shao; Chengbo Wei; Dongxiang Zhang; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Trajectory data gathered by mobile positioning techniques and location-awaredevices contain plenty of sensitive spatial-temporal and semantic information; and cansupport many applications through data analysing and mining. However; attribute-linkageand re-identification attacks on such data may cause privacy leakage; and lead tounexpected serious consequences. Existing privacy preserving techniques for trajectorydata often ignore the different privacy requirements of different moving objects or largelyscarify the availability of trajectory data. In view of these issues; we propose an effectivepersonalized trajectory privacy preserving method which can strike a good balance betweenuser-defined privacy requirement and data availability in off-line trajectory publishingscenario.

A Graph-Theoretic Fusion Framework for Unsupervised Entity Resolution,Dongxiang Zhang; Long Guo; Xiangnan He; Jie Shao; Sai Wu; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract—Entity resolution identifies all records in a database that refer to the same entity.The mainstream solutions rely on supervised learning or crowd assistance; both requiringlabor overhead for data annotation. To avoid human intervention; we propose anunsupervised graph-theoretic fusion framework with two components; namely ITER andCliqueRank. Specifically; ITER constructs a weighted bipartite graph between terms andrecord-record pairs and iteratively propagates the node salience until convergence.Subsequently; CliqueRank constructs a record graph to estimate the likelihood of tworecords resident in the same clique. The derived likelihood from CliqueRank is fed back toITER to rectify the edge weight until a joint optimum can be reached.
