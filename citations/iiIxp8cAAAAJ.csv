Evaluating window joins over unbounded streams,Jaewoo Kang; Jeffrey F Naughton; Stratis D Viglas,We investigate algorithms for evaluating sliding window joins over pairs of unboundedstreams. We introduce a unit-time-basis cost model to analyze the expected performance ofthese algorithms. Using this cost model; we propose strategies for maximizing the efficiencyof processing joins in three scenarios. First; we consider the case where one stream is muchfaster than the other. We show that asymmetric combinations of join algorithms;(eg; hashjoin on one input; nested-loops join on the other) can outperform symmetric join algorithmimplementations. Second; we investigate the case where system resources are insufficientto keep up with the input streams. We show that we can maximize the number of join resulttuples produced in this case by properly allocating computing resources across the two inputstreams. Finally; we investigate strategies for maximizing the number of result tuples …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,485
Catching the boat with Strudel: Experiences with a web-site management system,Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Jaewoo Kang; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract The Strudel system applies concepts from database management systems to theprocess of building Web sites. Strudel's key idea is separating the management of the site'sdata; the creation and management of the site's structure; and the visual presentation of thesite's pages. First; the site builder creates a uniform model of all data available at the site.Second; the builder uses this model to declaratively define the Web site's structure byapplying a “site-definition query” to the underlying data. The result of evaluating this query isa “site graph”; which represents both the site's content and structure. Third; the builderspecifies the visual presentation of pages in Strudel's HTML-template language. The datamodel underlying Strudel is a semi-structured model of labeled directed graphs.

On schema matching with opaque column names and data values,Jaewoo Kang; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract Most previous solutions to the schema matching problem rely in some fashion uponidentifying" similar" column names in the schemas to be matched; or by recognizingcommon domains in the data stored in the schemas. While each of these approaches isvaluable in many cases; they are not infallible; and there exist instances of the schemamatching problem for which they do not even apply. Such problem instances typically arisewhen the column names in the schemas and the data in the columns are" opaque" or verydifficult to interpret. In this paper we propose a two-step technique that works even in thepresence of opaque column names and data values. In the first step; we measure the pair-wise attribute correlations in the tables to be matched and construct a dependency graphusing mutual information as a measure of the dependency between attributes.

However; merely being anXML query-processing engine does not render a system suitable for querying the Internet. Auseful system must provide mechanisms to (a) find the XML files that are relevant to a givenquery; and (b) deal with remote data sources that either provide unpredictable data accessand transfer rates; or are infinite streams; or both. The Niagara Internet Query System wasdesigned from the bottom-up to provide these mechanisms. In this article we describe theoverall Niagara architecture; and how Niagara finds relevant XML documents by using acollaboration between the Niagara XML-QL query processor and the Niagara “text-in-context” XML search engine.

STRUDEL: a Web site management system,Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Jaewoo Kang; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,The growth of the World-Wide Web has created a new kind of data management problem: buildingand main- taining Web sites. Building a Web site involves several tasks; such as choosing whatinformation will be avail- able at the site; organizing that information in individ- ual pages or ingraphs of linked pages; and specifying the visual presentation of pages in HTML. Creating andmanaging large sites is tedious; because a user often must perform these tasks simultaneouslywhen creat- ing HTML pages. The task of building and manag- ing Web sites presents a uniqueopportunity for apply- ing concepts from database management systems; such as the separationbetween the logical view of informa- tion and its storage and maintenance and the ability to restructureinformation via queries. Furthermore; re- cent research results on information integration[U1197] … Web site by creating different views of the underlying data. Building …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,224
Comparative study of name disambiguation problem using a scalable blocking-based framework,Prasenjit Mitra; Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee; Byung-won On,In this paper; we consider the problem of ambiguous author names in bibliographic citations;and comparatively study alternative approaches to identify and correct such name variants(eg;" Vannevar Bush" and" V. Vush"). Our study is based on a scalable two-step framework;where step 1 is to substantially reduce the number of candidates via blocking; and step 2 isto measure the distance of two names via coauthor information. Combining four blockingmethods and seven distance measures on four data sets; we present extensiveexperimental results; and identify combinations that are scalable and effective todisambiguate author names in citations,Digital Libraries; 2005.

Effective and scalable solutions for mixed and split citation problems in digital libraries,Dongwon Lee; Byung-Won On; Jaewoo Kang; Sanghyun Park,Abstract In this paper; we consider two important problems that commonly occur inbibliographic digital libraries; which seriously degrade their data qualities: Mixed Citation(MC) problem (ie; citations of different scholars with their names being homonyms are mixedtogether) and Split Citation (SC) problem (ie; citations of the same author appear underdifferent name variants). In particular; we investigate an effective yet scalable solution sincecitations in such digital libraries tend to be large-scale. After formally defining the problemsand accompanying challenges; we present an effective solution that is based on the state-of-the-art sampling-based approximate join algorithm. Our claim is verified through preliminaryexperimental results.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Information quality in information systems,2005,95
Are your citations clean?,Dongwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Prasenjit Mitra; C Lee Giles; Byung-Won On,"Citations" play an important role in many scientific-publication digital libraries (DLs); includingCiteSeer; arXiv e-Print; DBLP; and Google Scholar. By "citation;" we mean the collection of bibliographicinformation (such as author name; article title; publication venue; and year published) pertinentto a particular article. Users often use citations to find information of interest in DLs; and researchersdepend on citations to determine the impact of a particular article in a DL. In addition; when DLsare integrated; citations serve as unique identifiers of associated documents. Therefore; citationsof stored documents in DLs must be consistent and up-to-date. But maintaining consistency isgenerally nontrivial.

The AMS-02 TRD on the international space station,Thomas Kirn; AMS-02 TRD Collaboration,Abstract The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a general purpose high energyparticle detector which was successfully deployed on the International Space Station (ISS)on 19 May 2011 to conduct a unique long duration mission of fundamental physics researchin space. The main goals of the AMS-02 experiment include antimatter and dark mattersearch and cosmic ray physics in the energy range from few GeV up to 2 TeV. The indirectsearch for dark matter candidates requires precise e+-spectroscopy with a suppression ofthe dominant proton background by six orders of magnitude. In AMS-02 it will be achievedwith a combination of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a transition radiation detector.,Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators; Spectrometers; Detectors and Associated Equipment,2013,54
Improving grouped-entity resolution using quasi-cliques,Byung-Won On; Ergin Elmacioglu; Dongwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Jian Pei,The entity resolution (ER) problem; which identifies duplicate entities that refer to the samereal world entity; is essential in many applications. In this paper; in particular; we focus onresolving entities that contain a group of related elements in them (eg; an author entity with alist of citations; a singer entity with song list; or an intermediate result by GROUP BY SQLquery). Such entities; named as grouped-entities; frequently occur in many applications. Theprevious approaches toward grouped-entity resolution often rely on textual similarity; andproduce a large number of false positives. As a complementing technique; in this paper; wepresent our experience of applying a recently proposed graph mining technique; Quasi-Clique; atop conventional ER solutions. Our approach exploits contextual information minedfrom the group of elements per entity in addition to syntactic similarity. Extensive …,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06.

Effective wrapping of graphene on individual Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 grains for high-rate Li-ion batteries,Yuhong Oh; Seunghoon Nam; Sungun Wi; Joonhyeon Kang; Taehyun Hwang; Sangheon Lee; Helen Hejin Park; Jordi Cabana; Chunjoong Kim; Byungwoo Park,An effective way of synthesizing graphene-wrapped Li4Ti5O12 particles was developed bysolid-state reaction between graphene oxide-wrapped P25 (TiO2) and Li2CO3. Comparedto the previously reported graphene/Li4Ti5O12 composites; prior wrapping of TiO2 withsubsequent chemical lithiation led to more effectively confined Li4Ti5O12. The Li4Ti5O12tightly bound by graphene exhibited a remarkable specific capacity of 147 mA hg− 1 at arate of 10 C (1 C= 175 mA g− 1) after 100 cycles. This rate capability is one of the highestvalues among reported Li4Ti5O12 with 150±50 nm grains. The improved rate capability wasattributed to the enhanced electronic conductivity of each Li4Ti5O12 grain via uniformgraphene wrapping; with single-grain growth during annealing from the initial∼ 25 nm TiO2nanoparticles enclosed by outer graphene sheets.

It was experimentally confirmed that theIONs had three magnetic phases and correspondingly different SLP characteristicsdepending on the particle sizes. Furthermore; it was demonstrated that puresuperparamagnetic phase IONs (d< 9.8 nm) showed insufficient SLPs critically limiting forhyperthermia applications due to smaller AC hysteresis loss power (Néel relaxation losspower) originated from lower out-of-phase magnetic susceptibility.,Applied Physics Letters,2012,45

Improving cancer classification accuracy using gene pairs,Pankaj Chopra; Jinseung Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Sunwon Lee,Recent studies suggest that the deregulation of pathways; rather than individual genes; maybe critical in triggering carcinogenesis. The pathway deregulation is often caused by thesimultaneous deregulation of more than one gene in the pathway. This suggests that robustgene pair combinations may exploit the underlying bio-molecular reactions that are relevantto the pathway deregulation and thus they could provide better biomarkers for cancer; ascompared to individual genes. In order to validate this hypothesis; in this paper; we usedgene pair combinations; called doublets; as input to the cancer classification algorithms;instead of the original expression values; and we showed that the classification accuracywas consistently improved across different datasets and classification algorithms. Wevalidated the proposed approach using nine cancer datasets and five classification …,Plos one,2010,39
A novel quasi-cubic CuFe 2 O 4–Fe 2 O 3 catalyst prepared at low temperature for enhanced oxidation of bisphenol A via peroxymonosulfate activation,Wen-Da Oh; Zhili Dong; Zhong-Ting Hu; Teik-Thye Lim,A facile eco-friendly co-precipitation synthesis at low temperature was employed to fabricateCuFe2O4–Fe2O3 for the oxidation of bisphenol A (BPA) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS)activation. The formation mechanism of CuFe2O4–Fe2O3 at low temperature is proposed.The FESEM and BET characterization studies revealed that the CuFe2O4–Fe2O3 catalysthas a quasi-cubic morphology and specific surface area of 63 m2 g− 1. The performance ofCuFe2O4–Fe2O3 as a PMS activator was compared with those of other catalysts and theresults indicated that the performance was in the following order: CuFe2O4–Fe2O3>CuFe2O4> CoFe2O4> CuBi2O4> CuAl2O4> Fe2O3> MnFe2O4.

Schema matching using interattribute dependencies,Jaewoo Kang; Jeffrey F Naughton,Schema matching is one of the key challenges in information integration. It is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To alleviate the problem; many automated solutionshave been proposed. Most of the existing solutions mainly rely upon textual similarity of thedata to be matched. However; there exist instances of the schema matching problem forwhich they do not even apply. Such problem instances typically arise when the columnnames in the schemas and the data in the columns are opaque or very difficult to interpret. Inour previous work [36] we proposed a two-step technique to address this problem. In the firststep; we measure the dependencies between attributes within tables using an information-theoretic measure and construct a dependency graph for each table capturing thedependencies among attributes. In the second step; we find matching node pairs across …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,25

Microarray data mining using landmark gene-guided clustering,Pankaj Chopra; Jaewoo Kang; Jiong Yang; HyungJun Cho; Heenam Stanley Kim; Min-Goo Lee,Clustering is a popular data exploration technique widely used in microarray data analysis.Most conventional clustering algorithms; however; generate only one set of clustersindependent of the biological context of the analysis. This is often inadequate to exploredata from different biological perspectives and gain new insights. We propose a newclustering model that can generate multiple versions of different clusters from a singledataset; each of which highlights a different aspect of the given dataset. By applying ourSigCalc algorithm to three yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets we show two results.First; we show that different sets of clusters can be generated from the same dataset usingdifferent sets of landmark genes. Each set of clusters groups genes differently and revealsnew biological associations between genes that were not apparent from clustering the …,BMC bioinformatics,2008,22
Efficient subsequence matching using the longest common subsequence with a dual match index,Tae Sik Han; Seung-Kyu Ko; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract The purpose of subsequence matching is to find a query sequence from a long datasequence. Due to the abundance of applications; many solutions have been proposed.Virtually all previous solutions use the Euclidean measure as the basis for measuringdistance between sequences. Recent studies; however; suggest that the Euclidean distanceoften fails to produce proper results due to the irregularity in the data; which is not souncommon in our problem domain. Addressing this problem; some non-Euclideanmeasures; such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence(LCS); have been proposed. However; most of the previous work in this direction focused onthe whole sequence matching problem where query and data sequences are the samelength. In this paper; we propose a novel subsequence matching framework using a non …,International Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition,2007,20

Efficient skycube computation using point and domain-based filtering,Gayathri Tambaram Kailasam; Jin-Seung Lee; Jae-Won Rhee; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Skyline queries have been increasingly used in multi-criteria decision making anddata mining applications. They retrieve a set of interesting points from a potentially large setof data points. A point is said to be interesting if it is not dominated by any other point.Skyline cube (skycube) consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given setof dimensions. In this paper; we propose two algorithms for computing skycube usingbitmaps that are derivable from indexes. The Point-based skycube algorithm is animprovement over the existing Bitmap algorithm; extended to compute skycube. The Point-based algorithm processes one point at a time to check for skylines in all subspaces. TheDomain-based skycube algorithm views points as value combinations and probes entiresearch space for potential skyline points. It significantly reduces bitmap access for low …,Information Sciences,2010,18
Integrating heterogeneous microarray data sources using correlation signatures,Jaewoo Kang; Jiong Yang; Wanhong Xu; Pankaj Chopra,Abstract Microarrays are one of the latest breakthroughs in experimental molecular biology.Thousands of different research groups generate tens of thousands of microarray geneexpression profiles based on different tissues; species; and conditions. Combining such vastamount of microarray data sets is an important and yet challenging problem. In this paper;we introduce a “correlation signature” method that allows the coherent interpretation andintegration of microarray data across disparate sources. The proposed algorithm first builds;for each gene (row) in a table; a correlation signature that captures the system-widedependencies existing between the gene and the other genes within the table; and thencompares the signatures across the tables for further analysis. We validate our frameworkwith an experimental study using real microarray data sets; the result of which suggests …,International Workshop on Data Integration in the Life Sciences,2005,18

A bibliometric method for measuring the degree of technological innovation,Woondong Yeo; Seonho Kim; Hyunwoo Park; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Knowing the degree and stage of a product's innovation is essential fortechnological forecasting and beneficial for governments and firms that want to come up withproduct promotion strategies and prioritize investments. Bibliometric analysis has beenwidely used as a practical tool to evaluate scientific activities. Although there were manybibliometric-based attempts to model product innovation stages; there have not been anytrials that approach it from the standpoint of uncertainty reduction in technological productinnovation. This paper suggests two hypotheses: 1) at a macro level; the year-to-yeardifference in relative research volumes of each component decreases over time as theuncertainty of a product decreases; and 2) at a micro level; the year-to-year difference inrelative research volumes of each component is correlated with the technological life …,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015,15
Establishing value mappings using statistical models and user feedback,Jaewoo Kang; Tae Sik Han; Dongwon Lee; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract In this paper; we present a" value mapping" algorithm that does not rely on syntacticsimilarity or semantic interpretation of the values. The algorithm first constructs a statisticalmodel (eg; co-occurrence frequency or entropy vector) that captures the uniquecharacteristics of values and their co-occurrence. It then finds the matching values bycomputing the distances between the models while refining the models using user feedbackthrough iterations. Our experimental results suggest that our approach successfullyestablishes value mappings even in the presence of opaque data values and thus can be auseful addition to the existing data integration techniques.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,15

A Study on the Design of ultrasonic Vibration Cutting Tool horn,Jong-Pyo Gang,Abstract Transforming small ultrasonic energy into large mechanical energy is the essentialfeature of ultrasonic vibration in various application fields. This energy amplification can beobtained by achieving resonance condition between booster or tool horn and transducer.When it has uniform section with small sectional area; one dimensional analysis providesgood estimation of the natural frequency of the horn. But; for arbitrary shape of horn; onedimensional analysis can no longer be applied. At present; designing tool horn whosenatural frequency is identical to that of transducer requires serveral stages of trial and errorin actual manufacturing process. In this paper; frequency analysis program is developed toeasily predict the natural frequency of ultrasonic vibration cutting tool with axisymmetry and3-dimensional shape using finite element method.,Journal of the Korean Society for Precision Engineering,1991,15

Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against the epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) have been widely and successfully used in treating NSCLCpatients with activating EGFR mutations. Unfortunately; the duration of response is short-lived; and all patients eventually relapse by acquiring resistance mechanisms. Result: Weperformed an integrative systems biology approach to determine essential kinases that driveEGFR-TKI resistance in cancer cell lines. We used a series of bioinformatics methods toanalyze and integrate the functional genetics screen and RNA-seq data to identify a set ofkinases that are critical in survival and proliferation in these TKI-resistant lines.

Multivariate stream data reduction in sensor network applications,Sungbo Seo; Jaewoo Kang; Keun Ho Ryu,Abstract We evaluated several multivariate stream data reduction techniques that can beused in sensor network applications. The evaluated techniques include Wavelet-basedmethods; sampling; hierarchical clustering; and singular value decomposition (SVD). Wetested the reduction methods over the range of different parameters including data reductionrate; data types; number of dimensions and data window size of the input stream. Both realand synthetic time series data were used for the evaluation. The results of experimentssuggested that the reduction techniques should be evaluated in the context of applications;as different applications generate different types of data and that has a substantial impact onthe performance of different reduction methods. The findings reported in this paper canserve as a useful guideline for sensor network design and construction.,International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing,2005,13
Identifying value mappings for data integration: An unsupervised approach,Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract The Web is a distributed network of information sources where the individualsources are autonomously created and maintained. Consequently; syntactic and semanticheterogeneity of data among sources abound. Most of the current data cleaning solutionsassume that the data values referencing the same object bear some textual similarity.However; this assumption is often violated in practice.“Two-door front wheel drive” can berepresented as “2DR-FWD” or “R2FD”; or even as “CAR TYPE 3” in different data sources.To address this problem; we propose a novel two-step automated technique that exploitsstatistical dependency structures among objects which is invariant to the tokensrepresenting the objects.

BRONCO: Biomedical entity Relation ONcology COrpus for extracting gene-variant-disease-drug relations,Kyubum Lee; Sunwon Lee; Sungjoon Park; Sunkyu Kim; Suhkyung Kim; Kwanghun Choi; Aik Choon Tan; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Comprehensive knowledge of genomic variants in a biological context is key forprecision medicine. As next-generation sequencing technologies improve; the amount ofliterature containing genomic variant data; such as new functions or related phenotypes;rapidly increases. Because numerous articles are published every day; it is almostimpossible to manually curate all the variant information from the literature. Manyresearchers focus on creating an improved automated biomedical natural languageprocessing (BioNLP) method that extracts useful variants and their functional informationfrom the literature. However; there is no gold-standard data set that contains texts annotatedwith variants and their related functions.

To complement standard search engines such asPubMed; it is desirable to have an advanced search tool that directly returns relevantbiomedical entities such as targets; drugs; and mutations rather than a long list of articles.Some existing tools submit a query to PubMed and process retrieved abstracts to extractinformation at query time; resulting in a slow response time and limited coverage of only afraction of the PubMed corpus. Other tools preprocess the PubMed corpus to speed up theresponse time; however; they are not constantly updated; and thus produce outdated results.Further; most existing tools cannot process sophisticated queries such as searches formutations that co-occur with query terms in the literature. To address these problems; we …,PloS one,2016,11
Deep semantic frame-based deceptive opinion spam analysis,Seongsoon Kim; Hyeokyoon Chang; Seongwoon Lee; Minhwan Yu; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract User-generated content is becoming increasingly valuable to both individuals andbusinesses due to its usefulness and influence in e-commerce markets. As consumers relymore on such information; posting deceptive opinions; which can be deliberately used forpotential profit; is becoming more of an issue. Existing work on opinion spam detectionfocuses mainly on linguistic features such as n-grams; syntactic patterns; or LIWC. However;deep semantic analysis remains largely unstudied. In this paper; we propose a frame-baseddeep semantic analysis method for understanding rich characteristics of deceptive andtruthful opinions written by various types of individuals including crowdsourcing workers;employees who have expert-level domain knowledge about local businesses; and onlineusers who post on Yelp and TripAdvisor. Using our proposed semantic frame feature; we …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,11
Consento: a new framework for opinion based entity search and summarization,Jaehoon Choi; Donghyeon Kim; Seongsoon Kim; Junkyu Lee; Sangrak Lim; Sunwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Search engines have become an important decision making tool today. Decisionmaking queries are often subjective; such as" a good birthday present for my girlfriend";"best action movies in 2010"; to name a few. Unfortunately; such queries may not beanswered properly by conventional search systems. In order to address this problem; weintroduce Consento; a consensus search engine designed to answer subjective queries.Consento performs segment indexing; as opposed to document indexing; to capturesemantics from user opinions more precisely. In particular; we define a new indexing unit;Maximal Coherent Semantic Unit (MCSU). An MCSU represents a segment of a document;which captures a single coherent semantic. We also introduce a new ranking method; calledConsensusRank that counts online comments referring to an entity as a weighted vote.

Large size metallic glass gratings by embossing,J Ma; J Yi; DQ Zhao; MX Pan; WH Wang,Bulk metallic glasses have excellent thermoforming ability in their wide supercooled liquidregion. We show that large-size metallic glass grating (∼ 8× 8 mm2) with fine periodicity andultra smooth surface feature can be readily fabricated by hot embossing. The method forfabrication of gratings is proved to be much cheaper; and requires low pressure and shorttime (less than 30 s). The metallic glass gratings exhibit comparable optical properties suchas rainbow-like spectrum when shone by fluorescent lamp light.,Journal of Applied Physics,2012,11
Identifying kinase dependency in cancer cells by integrating high-throughput drug screening and kinase inhibition data,Karen A Ryall; Jimin Shin; Minjae Yoo; Trista K Hinz; Jihye Kim; Jaewoo Kang; Lynn E Heasley; Aik Choon Tan,Abstract Motivation: Targeted kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer treatment;but kinase dependency for an individual patient or cancer cell can be challenging to predict.Kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene expression and mutation status.High-throughput drug screens are powerful tools for determining kinase dependency; butdrug polypharmacology can make results difficult to interpret. Results: We developed KinaseAddiction Ranker (KAR); an algorithm that integrates high-throughput drug screening data;comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene expression profiles to identify kinasedependency in cancer cells. We applied KAR to predict kinase dependency of 21 lungcancer cell lines and 151 leukemia patient samples using published datasets. Weexperimentally validated KAR predictions of FGFR and MTOR dependence in lung …,Bioinformatics,2015,10

The IMgrades were classified into four groups as negative; mild; moderate or severe using theupdated Sydney scoring system. The IM subtypes were categorized as type I; type II; andtype III using high iron diamine and alcian blue (pH 2.5) staining. The CDX2 expression inthe IM foci was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in specimens from the antrum and/orbody. Results CDX2 expression increased according to IM severity (p= 0.001) but was notassociated with the IM subtype (p= 0.881) in the antrum specimens. Similarly; CDX2expression increased according to the IM grade (p= 0.001) but was not associated with theIM subtype (p= 0.755) in the body specimens. CDX2 expression was also increased …,Gut and liver,2012,10
Record Linkage as DNA Sequence Alignment Problem.,Yoojin Hong; Tao Yang; Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee,ABSTRACT Since modern database applications increasingly need to deal with dirty datadue to a variety of reasons (eg; data entry errors; heterogeneous formats; and ambiguousterms); considerable recent efforts have focused on the (record) linkage problem todetermine if two entities represented as relational records are approximately the same ornot. In this paper; we propose a novel idea of using the popular gene sequence alignmentalgorithm in Biology–BLAST. Our proposal; termed as the BLASTed linkage; is based on theobservations that:(1) both problems are variants of approximate pattern matching;(2) BLASTprovides the statistical guarantee of search results in a scalable manner–a greatly lackingfeature in many linkage solutions; and (3) by transforming the record linkage problem intothe gene sequence alignment problem; one can leverage on a wealth of advanced …,QDB/MUD,2008,10
Clustering orthologous proteins across phylogenetically distant species,Sunshin Kim; Jaewoo Kang; Yong Je Chung; Jinyan Li; Keun Ho Ryu,Abstract The quality of orthologous protein clusters (OPCs) is largely dependent on theresults of the reciprocal BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) hits among genomes. TheBLAST algorithm is very efficient and fast; but it is very difficult to get optimal solution amongphylogenetically distant species because the genomes with large evolutionary distancetypically have low similarity in their protein sequences. To reduce the false positives in theOPCs; thresholding is often employed on the BLAST scores. However; the thresholding alsoeliminates large numbers of true positives as the orthologs from distant species likely havelow BLAST scores. To rectify this problem; we introduce a new hybrid method combining theRecursive and the Markov CLuster (MCL) algorithms without using the BLAST thresholding.In the first step; we use InParanoid to produce n (n− 1)/2 ortholog tables from n genomes …,Proteins: Structure; Function; and Bioinformatics,2008,9
AIDS; public policy and child well-being,Giovanni Andrea Cornia,During the last decade; the AIDS pandemic has seriously hindered achievement of the childsurvival and development goals set with such hope at the World Summit for Children in1990. This is particularly true of the some 40 countries with adult prevalence above 1 percent; in countries with medium to high prevalence; AIDS has more than wiped out the childmortality gains realized during the 1980s. Moreover; the prospects for the future are notencouraging; as in some 20 countries adult prevalence and the under-five mortality rate(U5MR) are expected to peak only around the middle of the next decade. Low coverage ofantiretroviral treatment to treat the virus means that the rate of deaths from AIDS-relatedillnesses and numbers of children orphaned by the epidemic will continue to rise; even incountries with declining prevalence. At the global level; the well-being of children will …,*,2007,9
ARCS: an aggregated related column scoring scheme for aligned sequences,Bin Song; Jeong-Hyeon Choi; Guangyu Chen; Jacek Szymanski; Guo-Qiang Zhang; Anthony KH Tung; Jaewoo Kang; Sun Kim; Jiong Yang,Abstract Motivation: Biologists frequently align multiple biological sequences to determineconsensus sequences and/or search for predominant residues and conserved regions.Particularly; determining conserved regions in an alignment is one of the most importantactivities. Since protein sequences are often several-hundred residues or longer; it is difficultto distinguish biologically important conserved regions (motifs or domains) from others. Thewidely used tools; Logos; Al2co; Confind; and the entropy-based method; often fail tohighlight such regions. Thus a computational tool that can highlight biologically importantregions accurately will be highly desired. Results: This paper presents a new scoringscheme ARCS (Aggregated Related Column Score) for aligned biological sequences.ARCS method considers not only the traditional character similarity measure but also …,Bioinformatics,2006,9
Ecological disequilibrium drives insect pest and pathogen accumulation in non-native trees,Casparus J Crous; Treena I Burgess; Johannes J Le Roux; David M Richardson; Bernard Slippers; Michael J Wingfield,Abstract Non-native trees have become dominant components of many landscapes;including urban ecosystems; commercial forestry plantations; fruit orchards and as invasivesin natural ecosystems. Often; these trees have been separated from their natural enemies (ieinsects and pathogens) leading to ecological disequilibrium; that is; the immediatebreakdown of historically co-evolved interactions once introduced into novel environments.Long-established; non-native tree plantations provide useful experiments to explore thedimensions of such ecological disequilibria. We quantify the status quo of non-native insectpests and pathogens catching up with their tree hosts (planted Acacia; Eucalyptus and Pinusspecies) in South Africa; and examine which native South African enemy species utilizethese trees as hosts. Interestingly; pines; with no confamilial relatives in South Africa and …,AoB Plants,2017,8

Automatic context-specific subnetwork discovery from large interaction networks,Ashis Saha; Aik Choon Tan; Jaewoo Kang,Genes act in concert via specific networks to drive various biological processes; includingprogression of diseases such as cancer. Under different phenotypes; different subsets of thegene members of a network participate in a biological process. Single gene analyses areless effective in identifying such core gene members (subnetworks) within a geneset/network; as compared to gene set/network-based analyses. Hence; it is useful to identifya discriminative classifier by focusing on the subnetworks that correspond to differentphenotypes. Here we present a novel algorithm to automatically discover the importantsubnetworks of closely interacting molecules to differentiate between two phenotypes(context) using gene expression profiles. We name it COSSY (COntext-Specific SubnetworkdiscoverY). It is a non-greedy algorithm and thus unlikely to have local optima problems …,PloS one,2014,8
Robust likelihood-based survival modeling with microarray data,HyungJun Cho; Ami Yu; Sukwoo Kim; Jaewoo Kang; Seung-Mo Hong,Abstract Gene expression data can be associated with various clinical outcomes. Inparticular; these data can be of importance in discovering survival-associated genes formedical applications. As alternatives to traditional statistical methods; sophisticated methodsand software programs have been developed to overcome the high-dimensional difficulty ofmicroarray data. Nevertheless; new algorithms and software programs are needed toinclude practical functions such as the discovery of multiple sets of survival-associatedgenes and the incorporation of risk factors; and to use in the R environment which manystatisticians are familiar with. For survival modeling with microarray data; we havedeveloped a software program (called rbsurv) which can be used conveniently andinteractively in the R environment. This program selects survival-associated genes based …,J Stat Softw,2009,8

Multivariable stream data classification using motifs and their temporal relations,Sungbo Seo; Jaewoo Kang; Keun Ho Ryu,Abstract Multivariable stream data is becoming increasingly common as diverse types ofsensor devices and networks are deployed. Building accurate classification models for suchdata has attracted a lot of attention from the research community. Most of the previous works;however; relied on features extracted from individual streams; and did not take into accountthe dependency relations among the features within and across the streams. In this work; wepropose new classification models that exploit temporal relations among features. Weshowed that consideration of such dependencies does significantly improve theclassification accuracy. Another benefit of employing temporal relations is the improvedinterpretability of the resulting classification models; as the set of temporal relations can beeasily translated to a rule using a sequence of inter-dependent events characterizing the …,Information Sciences,2009,7
Selective approach to handling topic oriented tasks on the world wide web,Amit C Awekar; Jaewoo Kang,We address the problem of handling topic oriented tasks on the World Wide Web. Our aim isto find most relevant and important pages for broad-topic queries while searching in a smallset of candidate pages. We present a link analysis based algorithm SelHITS which is animprovement over Kleinberg's HITS algorithm. We introduce concept of virtual links to exploitlatent information in the hyperlinked environment. Selective expansion of the root set andnovel ranking strategy are the distinguishing features of our approach. Selective expansionmethod avoids topic drift and provides results consistent with only one interpretation of thequery. Experimental evaluation and user feedback show that our algorithm indeed distillsthe most relevant and important pages for broad-topic queries.

A scalable architecture for SIP infrastructure using content addressable networks,Ramrajprabu Balasubramanian; Injong Rhee; Jaewoo Kang,Session initiation protocol (SIP) provides call establishment functions for VoIP. Thesefunctions are highly CPU-intensive and hence need to be distributed over multiple servers inorder to support the peak workload. Existing approaches to this problem are unfortunatelynot scalable or fault-tolerant; incurring high maintenance overheads or introducing a singlepoint of failure. This paper presents a proof-of-concept design and analysis of a scalable;robust architecture for SIP infrastructures using a content addressable network (CAN) model;called CASIP (CAN-based SIP). The performance study of CASIP using real implementationof a SIP stack and NS-2 shows that the proposed system distributes the SIP processing (bothupdate and lookup) load over multiple nodes very effectively without incurring much routingand maintenance overhead.,Communications; 2005.

Aggregative and stochastic model of main path identification: a case study on graphene,Woondong Yeo; Seonho Kim; Jae-Min Lee; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract This paper suggests a new method to search main path; as a knowledge trajectory;in the citation network. To enhance the performance and remedy the problems suggested byother researchers for main path analysis (Hummon and Doreian; Social Networks 11 (1): 39–63; 1989); we applied two techniques; the aggregative approach and the stochasticapproach. The first technique is used to offer improvement of link count methods; such asSPC; SPLC; SPNP; and NPPC; which have a potential problem of making a mistaken picturesince they calculate link weights based on a individual topology of a citation link; the othertechnique; the second-order Markov chains; is used for path dependent search to improvethe Hummon and Doreian's priority first search method.

Evaluation of antioxidants activity through the chemical assay,Jin Hong; Minjung Wie; Donggil Leem; Kyoung Sik Park; Taehyung Yoon; Ki-Mi No; Jayoung Jeong,Recently; studies on natural source antioxidants have become increasingly active in variousfields. Among analytical methods for assessment of antioxidant activity; the DPPH; ABTS;and TBA assays have become quite popular in natural antioxidant studies. One of thereasons is that these methods are simple to use and highly sensitive. In particular; DPPHand ABTS assays are based on the theory that a hydrogen donor is an antioxidant. Theantioxidant effect can be easily evaluated by following the decrease of specific UVabsorption and the results are usually expressed in terms of Trolox equivalent antioxidantcapacity (TEAC). The TBA assay has been commonly used for measurement of lipidoxidation in some foods and biological systems. Because the colored complex is formed bythe TBA-malonaldehyde interaction; the TBA value can be evaluated using a UV …,Journal of Biomedical Research,2010,6
Online removal of ocular artifacts from single channel EEG for ubiquitous healthcare applications,Hanjun Shin; Himchan Kim; Sangjin Lee; Jaewoo Kang,A large number of ubiquitous healthcare systems and applications have been introducedrecently as a result of breakthroughs in technologies such as wireless sensors and BAN(body area network). However; most of the previous work has focused on the technologyplatform and service architecture for u-healthcare; and sensor data acquisition and handlinghave not received much attention. Readings from sensors are typically unreliable andcontain a lot of noise; especially when they are used in uncontrolled environments such asubiquitous healthcare systems. Without proper handling of noise; quality of service cannotbe guaranteed. The problem is exacerbated for EEG signals; because the signal-to-noiseratio is especially low; the number of channels is limited; and noise (mostly ocular artifacts)removal should be done online. In this work; we introduce a method called online SSA in …,Ubiquitous Information Technologies & Applications; 2009. ICUT'09. Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on,2009,6
Efficient quantitative assessment of facial paralysis using iris segmentation and active contour-based key points detection with hybrid classifier,Jocelyn Barbosa; Kyubum Lee; Sunwon Lee; Bilal Lodhi; Jae-Gu Cho; Woo-Keun Seo; Jaewoo Kang,Facial palsy or paralysis (FP) is a symptom that loses voluntary muscles movement in oneside of the human face; which could be very devastating in the part of the patients.Traditional methods are solely dependent to clinician's judgment and therefore timeconsuming and subjective in nature. Hence; a quantitative assessment system becomesapparently invaluable for physicians to begin the rehabilitation process; and to produce areliable and robust method is challenging and still underway. We introduce a novelapproach for a quantitative assessment of facial paralysis that tackles classification problemfor FP type and degree of severity. Specifically; a novel method of quantitative assessment ispresented: an algorithm that extracts the human iris and detects facial landmarks; and ahybrid approach combining the rule-based and machine learning algorithm to analyze …,BMC medical imaging,2016,5

Drug-drug interaction analysis using heterogeneous biological information network,Kyubum Lee; Sunwon Lee; Minji Jeon; Jaehoon Choi; Jaewoo Kang,As the number of drugs increases; more prescription choices are available for physicians;and consequently the number of drugs administered together has increased. Researchersare working on finding multi-drug prescriptions that are effective and safe. An efficientmethod for finding DDIs plays a crucial role in this research. In order to address the problem;we construct a heterogeneous biological information network by combining multiple differentdatabases and interaction information. Our network includes the information about genes;proteins; pathways; drugs; side effects; targets and their interactions. We propose a metric tomeasure the relation strength between two nodes in the network; which is based on theweighted sum of the numbers of paths containing different interaction types.

Adaptive BLASTing through the Sequence Dataspace: Theories on Protein Sequence Embedding,Yoojin Hong; Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee; Randen L Patterson; Damian B van Rossum,Abstract: We theorize that phylogenetic profiles provide a quantitative method that can relatethe structural and functional properties of proteins; as well as their evolutionaryrelationships. A key feature of phylogenetic profiles is the interoperable data format (egalignment information; physiochemical information; genomic information; etc). Indeed; wehave previously demonstrated Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) are aninformative M-dimension which can be scored from quantitative measure of embedded orunmodified sequence alignments. Moreover; the information obtained from these alignmentsis informative; even in the twilight zone of sequence similarity (< 25% identity)(1-5). Althoughpowerful; our previous embedding strategy suffered from contaminating alignments(embedded AND unmodified) and computational expense. Herein; we describe the logic …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0911.0650,2009,5
Exploiting inter-gene information for microarray data integration,Kuan-ming Lin; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Microarray data integration is an important yet challenging problem. Usually; directintegration of microarrays after normalization is ineffective because of the diverse types ofexperiment specific variations. To address this issue; two novel integration approaches wereproposed in recent microarray studies. The first study [16] presented a cancer classificationtechnique which identifies gene pairs whose expression orders are consistent within classand different across classes. The other study [18] presented a promising gene expressionanalysis technique which utilizes pairwise correlations of gene expressions across differentmicroarray datasets. Interestingly; we observe that both of the independently developedtechniques rely on inter-gene information and noise filtering strategy to achieve satisfactoryperformance in microarray integration. Motivated by this observation; we propose in this …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2007,5

IDB: Unified Query Interface for Information on the Web,Jaewoo Kang,XML [4] is likely to become the primary vehicle of the information interchange on the Web.Organizations will publish and export their data in XML to facilitate inter-and intra-organization information sharing. Businesses will publish their product information in XMLfor their customers or for software agents for on-line shopping services. This is alreadybeginning to happen: a number of ontologies have been developed and adopted by manyfinancial and research communities; including Open Financial Exchange (OFX)[18];Mathematical Markup Language (MathML)[12]; Biopolymer Markup Language (BIOML)[2];and others. Note that XML will not just be used for publishing static documents; queryableinformation sources will provide access to the data they store by defining an external view ofit in XML [5; 20].

High precision rule based PPI extraction and per-pair basis performance evaluation,Junkyu Lee; Seongsoon Kim; Sunwon Lee; Kyubum Lee; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Virtually all current PPI extraction studies focus on improving F-score; aiming tobalance the performance on both precision and recall. However; in many realistic scenariosinvolving large corpora; one can benefit more from an extremely high precision PPIextraction tool than a high-recall counterpart. We also argue that the current" per-instance"basis performance evaluation method should be revisited. In order to address theseproblems; we introduce a new rule-based PPI extraction method equipped with a set of ultra-high precision extraction rules. We also propose a new" per-pair" basis performance metric;which is more pragmatic in practice. The proposed PPI extraction method achieves 95-96%per-pair and 94-97% per-instance precisions on the AIMed benchmark corpus.,Proceedings of the ACM sixth international workshop on Data and text mining in biomedical informatics,2012,4
Adaptive pattern mining model for early detection of botnet‐propagation scale,Do Hoon Kim; Taek Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Hyunchoel Jeong; Hoh Peter In,ABSTRACT Botnets are a disastrous threat because they execute malicious activities suchas distributed denial-of-service; spam email; malware downloads (such as eggdownloads);and spying by exploiting zombie PCs under their control. Botnets infect PCs on a huge scaleby initially scanning the service ports of vulnerable applications for the purpose ofpropagation; which is leveraged as the size of the botnet increases. Therefore; it is of crucialimportance to detect botnet-propagation activities early and to determine the expectedsize ofthe attack. To address this issue; this paper proposes to recreate botnets' port-scanningpatterns using a simple text classifier that represents these patterns as a kind of matrix. Thepatterns obtained are then used to train a hidden Markov model and to perform earlydetection using the trained model. Early detection is achievable by catching the onset of …,Security and Communication Networks,2012,4
BOSS: A biomedical object search system,Jaehoon Choi; Donghyeon Kim; Seongsoon Kim; Sunwon Lee; Kyubum Lee; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract It has never been easy to search relevant information from ever increasing corpusof academic literatures. Large volume of research exists concerning this problem. Theprevious solutions are put on either ends of spectrum: general-purpose search and domain-specific" deep" search systems. The general-purpose search systems such as PubMed offerflexible query interface; but churn out a list of matching documents that users have to digestin order to find the answers to their queries. On the other hand; the" deep" search systemssuch as PPI Finder and iHOP return the precompiled results in a structured way.

The underlying molecular mechanisms and the role of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) in triggering ethanol-induced Purkinje cell death are; however; largelyunresolved. We undertook TUNEL staining; western blotting assay andimmunohistochemistry for the cleaved forms of caspase-3 and-9; with calbindin D28Kdouble immunostaining to identify apoptotic Purkinje cells. The possibility of ROS-inducedPurkinje cell death was immunohistochemically determined by using anti-8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG); a specific cellular marker for oxidative damage. The resultsshow that Purkinje cell death of PD 5 rat cerebellum following ethanol administration ismediated by the activation of caspase-3 and-9.

A cube framework for incorporating inter-gene information into biological data mining,Kuan-ming Lin; Jaewoo Kang; Hanjun Shin; Jusang Lee,Large volumes of microarray data are registered daily in public repositories such as SMD(Belkin and Niyogi; 2003) and GEO (Ashburner et al.; 2000). Such repositories have quicklybecome a community resource. However; due to the inherent heterogeneity of themicroarray experiments; the data generated from different experiments could not be directlyintegrated and hence the resources have not been fully utilised. To address this problem; wepropose a new microarray integration framework that achieves high-quality integrationthrough exploiting invariant features such as relative information among genes. We alsoshow how the proposed approach generalises the previous frameworks.,International journal of data mining and bioinformatics,2009,4

A study on the characteristic and rising cause of sheath circulating current by analysis and measurement,Ji-Won Gang; Hae-Won Yang,Abstract It is common to install multiple lines in the same route. Recently; excessive sheathcirculating current was partially measured in underground cable systems of KEPCO.Especially; the installation type; unbalance section length between joint boxes and zerosequence current by distribution cable have an effect on the rising of sheath circulatingcurrent in the underground transmission system. If excessive current flows in sheath; sheathloss which is reduced the transmission capacity is produced. This paper describes therelation analysis of sheath circulating current and burying types. And also; a detailedanalysis on rising cause and characteristic of sheath circulating current by consideringvarious unbalanced conditions presents using analysis and measurement regarding cablesystems which have the problem of excessive sheath circulation current.,The Transactions of the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers A,2002,4
The Elasticity Analysis of a Bow,Byoung Hwa Ahn,The purpose of this study was to analyze the elastic forces of a bow and a limb at variousdegrees of pull and the vibration of a bow after shooting to investigate the mechanicalcharacteristics of a bow and a limb. A device that can measure the elastic forces of a bowand the separate limb was developed for this study. Elastic forces of a bow and a limb weremeasured at 12 locations from the initial resting position to a position that a bow or a limb isfully pulled. The shape of a limb varying with the strength of pull was recorded by a videocamera. The locations of markers attached on a limb were digitized using a video digitizingsystem. A high speed video camera (Nac High Speed Video 1000fps; Japan) was employedto measure the vibration of a bow.

Prioritizing biological pathways by recognizing context in time-series gene expression data,Jusang Lee; Kyuri Jo; Sunwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Sun Kim,The primary goal of pathway analysis using transcriptome data is to find significantlyperturbed pathways. However; pathway analysis is not always successful in identifyingpathways that are truly relevant to the context under study. A major reason for this difficulty isthat a single gene is involved in multiple pathways. In the KEGG pathway database; thereare 146 genes; each of which is involved in more than 20 pathways. Thus activation of evena single gene will result in activation of many pathways. This complex relationship oftenmakes the pathway analysis very difficult. While we need much more powerful pathwayanalysis methods; a readily available alternative way is to incorporate the literatureinformation. In this study; we propose a novel approach for prioritizing pathways bycombining results from both pathway analysis tools and literature information. The basic …,BMC bioinformatics,2016,3
On the efficacy of per-relation basis performance evaluation for PPI extraction and a high-precision rule-based approach,Junkyu Lee; Seongsoon Kim; Sunwon Lee; Kyubum Lee; Jaewoo Kang,Background Most previous Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) studies evaluated theiralgorithms' performance based on" per-instance" precision and recall; in which the instancesof an interaction relation were evaluated independently. However; we argue that thisstandard evaluation method should be revisited. In a large corpus; the same relation can bedescribed in various different forms and; in practice; correctly identifying not all but a smallsubset of them would often suffice to detect the given interaction. Methods In this regard; wepropose a more pragmatic" per-relation" basis performance evaluation method instead ofthe conventional per-instance basis method. In the per-relation basis method; only a subsetof a relation's instances needs to be correctly identified to make the relation positive. In thiswork; we also introduce a new high-precision rule-based PPI extraction algorithm. While …,BMC medical informatics and decision making,2013,3
Comparative meta-analysis between human and mouse cancer microarray data reveals critical pathways,Pankaj Chopra; Jaewoo Kang; Seung-Mo Hong,Identification of deregulated biomolecular pathways in cancer may be more important thanidentification of individual genes through differential expression. We have analysed datafrom 87 microarray datasets; spanning 25 different types of cancer; and have identifiedseveral hundred pathways that are statistically significant (p< 0.01) and deregulated incancer. We also conducted a meta-analysis of 18 mouse cancer datasets and found that astatistically significant number of ontology terms are common between human and mousecancers and known for their role in carcinogenesis. These point to critical pathways that aredisrupted in both human and mouse cancers.,International journal of data mining and bioinformatics,2013,3

광범위 환경에서 EKF-SLAM 의 일관성 향상을 위한 새로운 관찰모델,남창주， 강재현， 도낙주,This paper suggests a new observation model for Extended Kalman Filter basedSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (EKF-SLAM). Since the EKF framework linearizesnon-linear functions around the current estimate; the conventional line model has largelinearization errors when a mobile robot locates faraway from its initial position. On the otherhand; the model that we propose yields less linearization error with respect to the landmarkposition and thus suitable in a large-scale environment. To achieve it; we build up a three-dimensional space by adding a virtual axis to the robot's two-dimensional coordinate systemand extract a plane by using a detected line on the two-dimensional space and the virtualaxis. Since Jacobian matrix with respect to the landmark position has small value; we canestimate the position of landmarks better than the conventional line model. The simulation …,로봇학회 논문지,2012,3

Multivariate stream data classification using simple text classifiers,Sungbo Seo; Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee; Keun Ho Ryu,Abstract We introduce a classification framework for continuous multivariate stream data.The proposed approach works in two steps. In the preprocessing step; it takes as input asliding window of multivariate stream data and discretizes the data in the window into astring of symbols that characterize the signal changes. In the classification step; it uses asimple text classification algorithm to classify the discretized data in the window. Weevaluated both supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms. For supervised; wetested Naïve Bayes Model and SVM; and for unsupervised; we tested Jaccard; TFIDF; Jaroand JaroWinkler. In our experiments; SVM and TFIDF outperformed the other classificationmethods. In particular; we observed that classification accuracy is improved when thecorrelation of attributes is also considered along with the n-gram tokens of symbols.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2006,3

Adaptive GDDA-BLAST: fast and efficient algorithm for protein sequence embedding,Yoojin Hong; Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee; Damian B Van Rossum,A major computational challenge in the genomic era is annotating structure/function to thevast quantities of sequence information that is now available. This problem is illustrated bythe fact that most proteins lack comprehensive annotations; even when experimentalevidence exists. We previously theorized that embedded-alignment profiles (simply“alignment profiles” hereafter) provide a quantitative method that is capable of relating thestructural and functional properties of proteins; as well as their evolutionary relationships. Akey feature of alignment profiles lies in the interoperability of data format (eg; alignmentinformation; physio-chemical information; genomic information; etc.).

Using gene pair combinations to improve the accuracy of the pam classifier,Pankaj Chopra; Jaewoo Kang; Jinseung Lee,Various classification methods have been used topredict the class of tissue samples basedon gene expressiondata. Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) is one of thetopclassifiers that has been extensively used for cancer classification. In this paper a novelmethod of combining expression data fromgene pairs is used to improve the overallaccuracy of PAM. Recent studies suggest that deregulation of pathways; ratherthanindividual genes; may be critical in triggering carcinogenesis. The pathway deregulation isoften caused by the simultaneousderegulation of more than one genes in the pathway.Robust genepair combinations may exploit these underlying bio-molecularreactions toprovide better biomarkers for cancer; as comparedto single genes. In this work; we usedgene pair combinations; called doublets; to improve the accuracy of PAM. We …,Bioinformatics and Biomedicine; 2009. BIBM'09. IEEE International Conference on,2009,2
Toward the scalable integration of internet information sources,Jaewoo Kang,ABSTRACT This dissertation in a broad sense focuses on understanding the fundamentalaspects of building a large-scale information integration system that can answer complexqueries over a large number of heterogeneous Internet data sources. Among manychallenges in achieving this goal; we focus on two key issues: efficient query processing andschema matching. Most of the data the integration system processes arrives in a stream froma remote source rather than residing on a local disk; we need to develop efficient queryprocessing algorithms that work in this environment. We specifically investigate algorithmsfor evaluating sliding window joins over pairs of unbounded streams. We introduce a unit-time-basis cost model to analyze the expected performance of these algorithms. Using thiscost model; we propose strategies for maximizing the efficiency of processing joins over …,*,2003,2

Literature-based condition-specific miRNA-mRNA target prediction,Minsik Oh; Sungmin Rhee; Ji Hwan Moon; Heejoon Chae; Sunwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Sun Kim,miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3′-UTR of genes. Many recent studies have reported that miRNAs play important biologicalroles by regulating specific mRNAs or genes. Many sequence-based target predictionalgorithms have been developed to predict miRNA targets. However; these methods are notdesigned for condition-specific target predictions and produce many false positives; thus;expression-based target prediction algorithms have been developed for condition-specifictarget predictions. A typical strategy to utilize expression data is to leverage the negativecontrol roles of miRNAs on genes. To control false positives; a stringent cutoff value istypically set; but in this case; these methods tend to reject many true target relationships; ie;false negatives. To overcome these limitations; additional information should be utilized …,PloS one,2017,1

A 2-phased approach for detecting multiple loci associations with traits,Sunwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Junho Oh,The recent advance in SNP genotyping has made a significant contribution to reduction ofthe costs for large-scale genotyping. The development also has dramatically increased thesize of the SNP genotype data. The increase in the volume of the data; however; has poseda huge obstacle to the conventional analysis techniques that are typically vulnerable to thehigh-dimensionality problem. To address the issue; we propose a method that exploits twowell-tested models: the document-term model and the transaction analysis model. Theproposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase; we reduce the dimensions of theSNP genotype data by extracting significant SNPs through transformation of the data in lieuof the document-term model. In the second phase; we discover the association rules thatsignify the relations between the SNPs and the traits; through the application of …,International journal of data mining and bioinformatics,2012,1

Deep learning of mutation-gene-drug relations from the literature,Kyubum Lee; Byounggun Kim; Yonghwa Choi; Sunkyu Kim; Wonho Shin; Sunwon Lee; Sungjoon Park; Seongsoon Kim; Aik Choon Tan; Jaewoo Kang,Molecular biomarkers that can predict drug efficacy in cancer patients are crucialcomponents for the advancement of precision medicine. However; identifying thesemolecular biomarkers remains a laborious and challenging task. Next-generationsequencing of patients and preclinical models have increasingly led to the identification ofnovel gene-mutation-drug relations; and these results have been reported and published inthe scientific literature. Here; we present two new computational methods that utilize all thePubMed articles as domain specific background knowledge to assist in the extraction andcuration of gene-mutation-drug relations from the literature. The first method uses theBiomedical Entity Search Tool (BEST) scoring results as some of the features to train themachine learning classifiers. The second method uses not only the BEST scoring results …,BMC bioinformatics,2018,*
Drug drug interaction extraction from the literature using a recursive neural network,Sangrak Lim; Kyubum Lee; Jaewoo Kang,Detecting drug-drug interactions (DDI) is important because information on DDIs can helpprevent adverse effects from drug combinations. Since there are many new DDI-relatedpapers published in the biomedical domain; manually extracting DDI information from theliterature is a laborious task. However; text mining can be used to find DDIs in thebiomedical literature. Among the recently developed neural networks; we use a RecursiveNeural Network to improve the performance of DDI extraction. Our recursive neural networkmodel uses a position feature; a subtree containment feature; and an ensemble method toimprove the performance of DDI extraction. Compared with the state-of-the-art models; theDDI detection and type classifiers of our model performed 4.4% and 2.8% better;respectively; on the DDIExtraction Challenge'13 test data.

A Pilot Study of Biomedical Text Comprehension using an Attention-Based Deep Neural Reader: Design and Experimental Analysis,Seongsoon Kim; Donghyeon Park; Yonghwa Choi; Kyubum Lee; Byounggun Kim; Minji Jeon; Jihye Kim; Aik Choon Tan; Jaewoo Kang,Background With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology centered on deep-learning; the computer has evolved to a point where it can read a given text and answer aquestion based on the context of the text. Such a specific task is known as the task ofmachine comprehension. Existing machine comprehension tasks mostly use datasets ofgeneral texts; such as news articles or elementary school-level storybooks. However; noattempt has been made to determine whether an up-to-date deep learning-based machinecomprehension model can also process scientific literature containing expert-levelknowledge; especially in the biomedical domain. Objective This study aims to investigatewhether a machine comprehension model can process biomedical articles as well asgeneral texts.

Name nationality classification with recurrent neural networks,Jinhyuk Lee; Hyunjae Kim; Miyoung Ko; Donghee Choi; Jaehoon Choi; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Personal names tend to have many variations differing from country to country.Though there exists a large amount of personal names on the Web; nationality predictionsolely based on names has not been fully studied due to its difficulties in extracting subtlecharacter level features. We propose a recurrent neural network based model which predictsnationalities of each name using automatic feature extraction. Evaluation of Olympic recorddata shows that our model achieves greater accuracy than previous feature basedapproaches in nationality prediction tasks. We also evaluate our proposed model andbaseline models on name ethnicity classification task; again achieving better or comparableperformances. We further investigate the effectiveness of character embeddings used in ourproposed model.,Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2017,*
Constructing and Evaluating a Novel Crowdsourcing-based Paraphrased Opinion Spam Dataset,Seongsoon Kim; Seongwoon Lee; Donghyeon Park; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Opinion spam; intentionally written by spammers who do not have actualexperience with services or products; has recently become a factor that undermines thecredibility of information online. In recent years; studies have attempted to detect opinionspam using machine learning algorithms. However; limitations of gold-standard spamdatasets still prove to be a major obstacle in opinion spam research. In this paper; weintroduce a novel dataset called Paraphrased OPinion Spam (POPS); which contains a newtype of review spam that imitates real human opinions using crowdsourcing. To create sucha seemingly truthful review spam dataset; we asked task participants to paraphrase truthfulreviews; and include factual information and domain knowledge in their reviews.

CLIP-GENE: a web service of the condition specific context-laid integrative analysis for gene prioritization in mouse TF knockout experiments,Benjamin Hur; Sangsoo Lim; Heejoon Chae; Seokjun Seo; Sunwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Sun Kim,Transcriptome data from the gene knockout experiment in mouse is widely used toinvestigate functions of genes and relationship to phenotypes. When a gene is knocked out;it is important to identify which genes are affected by the knockout gene. Existing methods;including differentially expressed gene (DEG) methods; can be used for the analysis.However; existing methods require cutoff values to select candidate genes; which canproduce either too many false positives or false negatives. This hurdle can be addressedeither by improving the accuracy of gene selection or by providing a method to rankcandidate genes effectively; or both. Prioritization of candidate genes should consider thegoals or context of the knockout experiment. As of now; there are no tools designed for bothselecting and prioritizing genes from the mouse knockout data. Hence; the necessity of a …,Biology direct,2016,*
SEMO: Searching Majority Opinions on Movies using SNS QA Threads,Jukyoung Lee; Yonghwa Choi; Suhkyung Kim; Seongsoon Kim; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Many people seek majority opinions by searching for question-answers that areuploaded by others or uploading their own questions on social media sites. However;people have to read through a large number of documents returned by search services tofind the majority opinions. Moreover; even when users upload questions on social mediasites; they cannot immediately obtain answers. To address these problems; we presentSearching Majority Opinions System (SEMO); a novel majority opinion-based search systemthat uses QA threads uploaded on SNS and cQA websites. SEMO returns entities based onmajority opinions for opinion-finding queries in real time. We also tackled a data sparsityproblem using a novel query component expansion approach.

A Crowdsourcing-Based Paraphrased Opinion Spam Dataset and Its Implication on Detection Performance,Seongwoon Lee; Seongsoon Kim; Donghyeon Park; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract Today; opinion reviews on the Web are often used as a means of informationexchange. As the importance of opinion reviews continues to grow; the number of issues foropinion spam also increases. Even though many research studies on detecting spamreviews have been conducted; some limitations of gold-standard datasets hinder research.Therefore; we introduce a new dataset called" Paraphrased Opinion Spam (POS)" thatcontains a new type of review spam that imitates truthful reviews. We have noticed thatspammers refer to existing truthful reviews to fabricate spam reviews. To create such aseemingly truthful review spam dataset; we asked task participants to paraphrase truthfulreviews to create a new deceptive review. The experiment results show that classifying ourPOS dataset is more difficult than classifying the existing spam datasets since the reviews …,KIISE Transactions on Computing Practices,2016,*
ICOSSY: An online tool for context-specific subnetwork discovery from gene expression data,Ashis Saha; Minji Jeon; Aik Choon Tan; Jaewoo Kang,Pathway analyses help reveal underlying molecular mechanisms of complex biologicalphenotypes. Biologists tend to perform multiple pathway analyses on the same dataset; asthere is no single answer. It is often inefficient for them to implement and/or install all thealgorithms by themselves. Online tools can help the community in this regard. Here wepresent an online gene expression analytical tool called iCOSSY which implements a novelpathway-based COntext-specific Subnetwork discoverY (COSSY) algorithm. iCOSSY alsoincludes a few modifications of COSSY to increase its reliability and interpretability. Userscan upload their gene expression datasets; and discover important subnetworks of closelyinteracting molecules to differentiate between two phenotypes (context). They can alsointeractively visualize the resulting subnetworks. iCOSSY is a web server that finds …,PloS one,2015,*
Smith Search: Opinion-Based Restaurant Search Engine,Jaehoon Choi; Donghyeon Kim; Donghee Choi; Sangrak Lim; Seongsoon Kim; Jaewoo Kang; Youngjae Choi,Abstract Search engines have become an important decision-making tool today.Unfortunately; they still need to improve in answering complex queries. The answers tocomplex decision-making queries such as``best burgers and fries''and``good restaurants foranniversary dinner;''are often subjective. The most relevant answer to the query can beobtained by only collecting people's opinions about the query; which are expressed invarious venues on the Web. Collected opinions are converted into a``consensus''list. All ofthis should be processed at query time; which is impossible under the current searchparadigm. To address this problem; we introduce Smith; a novel opinion-based restaurantsearch engine.

Fast Online Motion Segmentation through Multi-Temporal Interval Motion Analysis,Jungwon Kang; Myung Jin Chung,In this paper; we present a new algorithm for fast online motion segmentation with low timecomplexity. Feature points in each input frame of an image stream are represented as aspatial neighbor graph. Then; the affinities for each point pair on the graph; as edge weights;are computed through our effective motion analysis based on multi-temporal intervals.Finally; these points are optimally segmented by agglomerative hierarchical clusteringcombined with normalized modularity maximization. Through experiments on publiclyavailable datasets; we show that the proposed method operates in real time with almostlinear time complexity; producing segmentation results comparable with those of recent state-of-the-art methods.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2015,*

SignatureClust: a tool for landmark gene-guided clustering,Pankaj Chopra; Hanjun Shin; Jaewoo Kang; Sunwon Lee,Abstract Over the last several years; many clustering algorithms have been applied to geneexpression data. However; most clustering algorithms force the user into having one set ofclusters; resulting in a restrictive biological interpretation of gene function. It would be difficultto interpret the complex biological regulatory mechanisms and genetic interactions from thisrestrictive interpretation of microarray expression data. The software packageSignatureClust allows users to select a group of functionally related genes (called'Landmark Genes'); and to project the gene expression data onto these genes. Compared toexisting algorithms and software in this domain; our software package offers two uniquebenefits. First; by selecting different sets of landmark genes; it enables the user to cluster themicroarray data from multiple biological perspectives. This encourages data exploration …,Soft Computing,2012,*

Meta-analysis of cancer microarray data reveals signaling pathway hotspots,Pankaj Chopra; Jaewoo Kang; Seung-Mo Hong,Recent studies have shown that the identification of deregulated bio-molecular pathways incancer may be more important than identification of individual genes through differentialexpression. Since the same pathway can be deregulated by a different subset of genes; it iscritical to study pathways as a whole; rather than focus on individual genes. Most papers onmeta-analysis of cancer datasets focus on the identification of a set of individual genes; andnot on pathways; protein families and gene ontology terms. We have analyzed data from 87microarray datasets consisting of 5;126 samples and spanning 25 different types of cancer.We have identified 212 KEGG pathways; 578 protein families and 1;717 gene ontologyterms that are statistically significant (p< 0.01); and deregulated in cancer.

Empirical Bayes analysis of unreplicated microarray data,HyungJun Cho; Jaewoo Kang; Jae K Lee,Abstract Because of the high costs of microarray experiments and the availability of onlylimited biological materials; microarray experiments are often performed with a smallnumber of replicates. Investigators; therefore; often have to perform their experiments withlow replication or without replication. However; the heterogeneous error variability observedin microarray experiments increases the difficulty in analyzing microarray data withoutreplication. No current analysis techniques are practically applicable to such microarray dataanalysis. We here introduce a statistical method; the so-called unreplicated heterogeneouserror model (UHEM) for the microarray data analysis without replication. This method ispossible by utilizing many adjacent-intensity genes for estimating local error variance afternonparametric elimination of differentially expressed genes between different biological …,Computational Statistics,2009,*

A Sliding Window-based Multivariate Stream Data Classification,Sung-Bo Seo; Jae-Woo Kang; Kwang-Woo Nam; Keun-Ho Ryu,Abstract In distributed wireless sensor network; it is difficult to transmit and analyze the entirestream data depending on limited networks; power and processor. Therefore it is suitable touse alternative stream data processing after classifying the continuous stream data. Wepropose a classification framework for continuous multivariate stream data. The proposedapproach works in two steps. In the preprocessing step; it takes input as a sliding window ofmultivariate stream data and discretizes the data in the window into a string of symbols thatcharacterize the signal changes. In the classification step; it uses a standard textclassification algorithm to classify the discretized data in the window. We evaluated bothsupervised and unsupervised classification algorithms.

Experimental Flow Analysis of LP Exhaust Hood for a Steam Turbine,Sang Joon Lee; Wei Zhang; Bu Geun Paik; Jong Hoon Kang; Young Gil Jang; Jung Yeop Lee; Soo Eun Lee; Koo Ha Park; Jin Hwan Kim,The flow structure and performance of exhaust hood for LP (low-pressure) steam turbine(SMART-P; 65MW) used for the generation of fresh-water were investigated experimentally.Due to general arrangement of the downward condenser; the discharging flow from the LSB(last stage blade) turns 90 degree from axial direction to radial direction. Therefore;aerodynamic design of the exhaust hood is essential to ensure the desirable pressurerecovery performance of the exhaust hood. Detailed understanding of flow behavior withinthe exhaust hood; especially pressure distribution inside the exhaust hood and velocitydistribution through the flow passage is important to estimate the kinetic energy loss andaerodynamic performance. The recent advancements for the analysis of a turbine exhausthood have been mainly achieved by CFD approaches. Tindell et al. analyzed an LP …,*,*,*

Global gene map for cancer reveals pathway,Pankaj Chopra; Han Jun Shin; Jaewoo Kang,Abstract—There have been a number of papers on meta-analysis of microarray datasets.Most of these papers have focused on genes (ie; differential expression of genes orcoexpression of gene pairs) to arrive at a prognostic signature. However; there has been noconcerted meta-analysis of expression data in relation to ontologies and pathways. Thecontribution of this paper is two-fold. First; it uses expression data to create global cancermaps for GO; KEGG and PFAM. These maps reveal hotspots of activation/de-activation. Thiswould be the largest meta-analysis of microarray data in terms of number of datasets andtypes of cancers represented. Second; in order to prove the concept; we perform an in-depthanalysis of the biological processes; pathways and proteins associated with breast cancer.This analysis reveals evidence of a strong link between the GO/KEGG/PFAM hotspots …,*,*,*
Adaptive Framework for Multivariate Stream Data Processing in Data-Centric Sensor Applications,Sungbo Seo; Jaewoo Kang; Dongwon Lee; Keun Ho Ryu,Abstract. We introduce an adaptive framework for multivariate sensor stream data reduction.The proposed method takes as input a sliding window of multivariate stream data; classifiesthe data in each window; and chooses reduction strategies that are most appropriate for thewindow. In the classification step; it discretizes the stream data into a string of symbols thatcharacterize the signal changes and then applies classification algorithms to classify thetransformed sensor stream data. In the second step; depending on the classification labelsassigned to each window; it applies most appropriate data reduction techniques andreduction ratios to the window. For classification; we considered supervised methodsincluding Naïve Bayes Model and SVM; and unsupervised methods including Jaccard;TFIDF; Jaro and JaroWinkler. For data reduction; we compared Wavelet; Sampling; SVD …,*,*,*
