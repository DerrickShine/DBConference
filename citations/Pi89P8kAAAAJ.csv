EASE: an effective 3-in-1 keyword search method for unstructured; semi-structured and structured data,Guoliang Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Conventional keyword search engines are restricted to a given data model andcannot easily adapt to unstructured; semi-structured or structured data. In this paper; wepropose an efficient and adaptive keyword search method; called EASE; for indexing andquerying large collections of heterogenous data. To achieve high efficiency in processingkeyword queries; we first model unstructured; semi-structured and structured data as graphs;and then summarize the graphs and construct graph indices instead of using traditionalinverted indices. We propose an extended inverted index to facilitate keyword-based search;and present a novel ranking mechanism for enhancing search effectiveness. We haveconducted an extensive experimental study using real datasets; and the results show thatEASE achieves both high search efficiency and high accuracy; and outperforms the …,SIGMOD 2008; Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,475
Effective keyword search for valuable lcas over xml documents,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of effective keyword search over XMLdocuments. We begin by introducing the notion of Valuable Lowest Common Ancestor(VLCA) to accurately and effectively answer keyword queries over XML documents. We thenpropose the concept of Compact VLCA (CVLCA) and compute the meaningful compactconnected trees rooted as CVLCAs as the answers of keyword queries. To efficientlycompute CVLCAs; we devise an effective optimization strategy for speeding up thecomputation; and exploit the key properties of CVLCA in the design of the stack-basedalgorithm for answering keyword queries. We have conducted an extensive experimentalstudy and the experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves both highefficiency and effectiveness when compared with existing proposals.,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,271
Efficient interactive fuzzy keyword search,Shengyue Ji; Guoliang Li; Chen Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Traditional information systems return answers after a user submits a completequery. Users often feel" left in the dark" when they have limited knowledge about theunderlying data; and have to use a try-and-see approach for finding information. A recenttrend of supporting autocomplete in these systems is a first step towards solving thisproblem. In this paper; we study a new information-access paradigm; called" interactive;fuzzy search;" in which the system searches the underlying data" on the fly" as the user typesin query keywords. It extends autocomplete interfaces by (1) allowing keywords to appear inmultiple attributes (in an arbitrary order) of the underlying data; and (2) finding relevantrecords that have keywords matching query keywords approximately. This framework allowsusers to explore data as they type; even in the presence of minor errors. We study …,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,226
Pass-Join: A Partition-based Method for Similarity Joins,Guoliang Li; Dong Deng; Jiannan Wang; Jianhua Feng,Abstract As an essential operation in data cleaning; the similarity join has attractedconsiderable attention from the database community. In this paper; we study string similarityjoins with edit-distance constraints; which find similar string pairs from two large sets ofstrings whose edit distance is within a given threshold. Existing algorithms are efficient eitherfor short strings or for long strings; and there is no algorithm that can efficiently andadaptively support both short strings and long strings. To address this problem; we proposea partition-based method called Pass-Join. Pass-Join partitions a string into a set ofsegments and creates inverted indices for the segments. Then for each string; Pass-Joinselects some of its substrings and uses the selected substrings to find candidate pairs usingthe inverted indices. We devise efficient techniques to select the substrings and prove that …,VLDB 2012,2012,140
Trie-join: Efficient trie-based string similarity joins with edit-distance constraints,Jiannan Wang; Jianhua Feng; Guoliang Li,Abstract A string similarity join finds similar pairs between two collections of strings. It is anessential operation in many applications; such as data integration and cleaning; and hasattracted significant attention recently. In this paper; we study string similarity joins with edit-distance constraints. Existing methods usually employ a filter-and-refine framework andhave the following disadvantages:(1) They are inefficient for the data sets with short strings(the average string length is no larger than 30);(2) They involve large indexes;(3) They areexpensive to support dynamic update of data sets. To address these problems; we proposea novel framework called trie-join; which can generate results efficiently with small indexes.We use a trie structure to index the strings and utilize the trie structure to efficiently find thesimilar string pairs based on subtrie pruning. We devise efficient trie-join algorithms and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,140
Leveraging transitive relations for crowdsourced joins,Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Tim Kraska; Michael J Franklin; Jianhua Feng,Abstract The development of crowdsourced query processing systems has recently attracteda significant attention in the database community. A variety of crowdsourced queries havebeen investigated. In this paper; we focus on the crowdsourced join query which aims toutilize humans to find all pairs of matching objects from two collections. As a human-onlysolution is expensive; we adopt a hybrid human-machine approach which first usesmachines to generate a candidate set of matching pairs; and then asks humans to label thepairs in the candidate set as either matching or non-matching. Given the candidate pairs;existing approaches will publish all pairs for verification to a crowdsourcing platform.However; they neglect the fact that the pairs satisfy transitive relations. As an example; if o 1matches with o 2; and o 2 matches with o 3; then we can deduce that o 1 matches with o 3 …,SIGMOD 2013,2013,131
Can We Beat the Prefix Filtering? An Adaptive Framework for Similarity Join and Search,Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract As two important operations in data cleaning; similarity join and similarity searchhave attracted much attention recently. Existing methods to support similarity join usuallyadopt a prefix-filtering-based framework. They select a prefix of each object and pruneobject pairs whose prefixes have no overlap. We have an observation that prefix lengthshave significant effect on the performance. Different prefix lengths lead to significantlydifferent performance; and prefix filtering does not always achieve high performance. Toaddress this problem; in this paper we propose an adaptive framework to support similarityjoin. We propose a cost model to judiciously select an appropriate prefix for each object. Toefficiently select prefixes; we devise effective indexes. We extend our method to supportsimilarity search. Experimental results show that our framework beats the prefix-filtering …,SIGMOD 2012,2012,129
Efficient type-ahead search on relational data: a tastier approach,Guoliang Li; Shengyue Ji; Chen Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Existing keyword-search systems in relational databases require users to submit acomplete query to compute answers. Often users feel" left in the dark" when they havelimited knowledge about the data; and have to use a try-and-see approach for modifyingqueries and finding answers. In this paper we propose a novel approach to keyword searchin the relational world; called Tastier. A Tastier system can bring instant gratification to usersby supporting type-ahead search; which finds answers" on the fly" as the user types in querykeywords. A main challenge is how to achieve a high interactive speed for large amounts ofdata in multiple tables; so that a query can be answered efficiently within milliseconds. Wepropose efficient index structures and algorithms for finding relevant answers on-the-fly byjoining tuples in the database. We devise a partition-based method to improve query …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,123
Effective keyword-based selection of relational databases,Bei Yu; Guoliang Li; Karen Sollins; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The wide popularity of free-and-easy keyword based searches over World WideWeb has fueled the demand for incorporating keyword-based search over structureddatabases. However; most of the current research work focuses on keyword-basedsearching over a single structured data source. With the growing interest in distributeddatabases and service oriented architecture over the Internet; it is important to extend such acapability over multiple structured data sources. One of the most important problems forenabling such a query facility is to be able to select the most useful data sources relevant tothe keyword query. Traditional database summary techniques used for selectingunstructured datasources developed in IR literature are inadequate for our problem; as theydo not capture the structure of the data sources. In this paper; we study the database …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,112
Supporting database applications as a service,Mei Hui; Dawei Jiang; Guoliang Li; Yuan Zhou,Multi-tenant data management is a form of Software as a Service (SaaS); whereby a thirdparty service provider hosts databases as a service and provides its customers withseamless mechanisms to create; store and access their databases at the host site. One ofthe main problems in such a system; as we shall discuss in this paper; is scalability; namelythe ability to serve an increasing number of tenants without too much query performancedegradation. A promising way to handle the scalability issue is to consolidate tuples fromdifferent tenants into the same shared tables. However; this approach introduces twoproblems: 1) The shared tables are too sparse. 2) Indexing on shared tables is not effective.To resolve the problems; we propose a multi-tenant database system called M-Store; whichprovides storage and indexing services for multi-tenants.

Fast-join: An efficient method for fuzzy token matching based string similarity join,Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,String similarity join that finds similar string pairs between two string sets is an essentialoperation in many applications; and has attracted significant attention recently in thedatabase community. A significant challenge in similarity join is to implement an effectivefuzzy match operation to find all similar string pairs which may not match exactly. In thispaper; we propose a new similarity metrics; called “fuzzy token matching based similarity”;which extends token-based similarity functions (eg; Jaccard similarity and Cosine similarity)by allowing fuzzy match between two tokens. We study the problem of similarity join usingthis new similarity metrics and present a signature-based method to address this problem.We propose new signature schemes and develop effective pruning techniques to improvethe performance.

DESKS: Direction-aware spatial keyword search,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Jing Xu,Location-based services (LBS) have been widely accepted by mobile users. Many LBSusers have direction-aware search requirement that answers must be in the searchdirection. However to the best of our knowledge there is not yet any research available thatinvestigates direction-aware search. A straightforward method first finds candidates withoutconsidering the direction constraint; and then generates the answers by pruning thosecandidates which invalidate the direction constraint. However this method is ratherexpensive as it involves a lot of useless computation on many unnecessary directions. Toaddress this problem; we propose a direction-aware spatial keyword search method whichinherently supports direction-aware search. We devise novel direction-aware indexingstructures to prune unnecessary directions. We develop effective pruning techniques and …,ICDE 2012,2012,79
String similarity joins: An experimental evaluation,Yu Jiang; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Wen-Syan Li,Abstract String similarity join is an important operation in data integration and cleansing thatfinds similar string pairs from two collections of strings. More than ten algorithms have beenproposed to address this problem in the recent two decades. However; existing algorithmshave not been thoroughly compared under the same experimental framework. For example;some algorithms are tested only on specific datasets. This makes it rather difficult forpractitioners to decide which algorithms should be used for various scenarios. To addressthis problem; in this paper we provide a comprehensive survey on a wide spectrum ofexisting string similarity join algorithms; classify them into different categories based on theirmain techniques; and compare them through extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets with different characteristics.

Online topic-aware influence maximization,Shuo Chen; Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Kian-lee Tan; Jinhui Tang,Abstract Influence maximization; whose objective is to select k users (called seeds) from asocial network such that the number of users influenced by the seeds (called influencespread) is maximized; has attracted significant attention due to its widespread applications;such as viral marketing and rumor control. However; in real-world social networks; usershave their own interests (which can be represented as topics) and are more likely to beinfluenced by their friends (or friends' friends) with similar topics. We can increase theinfluence spread by taking into consideration topics. To address this problem; we study topic-aware influence maximization; which; given a topic-aware influence maximization (TIM)query; finds k seeds from a social network such that the topic-aware influence spread of thek seeds is maximized. Our goal is to enable online TIM queries. Since the topic-aware …,VLDB 2015,2015,70
Massjoin: A mapreduce-based method for scalable string similarity joins,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; Shuang Hao; Jiannan Wang; Jianhua Feng,String similarity join is an essential operation in data integration. The era of big data calls forscalable algorithms to support large-scale string similarity joins. In this paper; we studyscalable string similarity joins using MapReduce. We propose a MapReduce-basedframework; called MASSJOIN; which supports both set-based similarity functions andcharacter-based similarity functions. We extend the existing partition-based signaturescheme to support set-based similarity functions. We utilize the signatures to generate key-value pairs. To reduce the transmission cost; we merge key-value pairs to significantlyreduce the number of key-value pairs; from cubic to linear complexity; while not sacrificingthe pruning power. To improve the performance; we incorporate “light-weight” filter units intothe key-value pairs which can be utilized to prune large number of dissimilar pairs without …,ICDE 2014,2014,68
LazyFTL: a page-level flash translation layer optimized for NAND flash memory,Dongzhe Ma; Jianhua Feng; Guoliang Li,Abstract Flash is a type of electronically erasable programmable read-only memory(EEPROM); which has many advantages over traditional magnetic disks; such as loweraccess latency; lower power consumption; lack of noise; and shock resistance. However;due to its special characteristics; flash memory cannot be deployed directly in the place oftraditional magnetic disks. The Flash Translation Layer (FTL) is a software layer built on rawflash memory that carries out garbage collection and wear leveling strategies and hides thespecial characteristics of flash memory from upper file systems by emulating a normal blockdevice like magnetic disks. Most existing FTL schemes are optimized for some specificaccess patterns or bring about significant overhead of merge operations under certaincircumstances. In this paper; we propose a novel FTL scheme named LazyFTL that …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,68
Retune: Retrieving and materializing tuple units for effective keyword search over relational databases,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract The existing approaches of keyword search over relational databases alwaysidentify the relationships between tuples on the fly; which are rather inefficient as suchrelational relationships are very rich in the underlying databases. Alternatively; this paperproposes an alternative way by retrieving and materializing tuple units for facilitating theonline processing of keyword search. We first propose a novel concept of tuple units; whichare composed of the relevant tuples connected by the primary-foreign-key relationships. Wethen demonstrate how to generate and materialize the tuple units; and the technique forgenerating the tuple units can be done by issuing SQL statements and thus can beperformed directly on the underlying RDBMS without modification to the database engine.Finally; we examine the techniques of indexing and ranking to improve the search …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2008,67

Entity matching: How similar is similar,Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Entity matching that finds records referring to the same entity is an importantoperation in data cleaning and integration. Existing studies usually use a given similarityfunction to quantify the similarity of records; and focus on devising index structures andalgorithms for efficient entity matching. However it is a big challenge to define" how similar issimilar" for real applications; since it is rather hard to automatically select appropriatesimilarity functions. In this paper we attempt to address this problem. As there are a largenumber of similarity functions; and even worse thresholds may have infinite values; it israther expensive to find appropriate similarity functions and thresholds. Fortunately; we havean observation that different similarity functions and thresholds have redundancy; and wehave an opportunity to prune inappropriate similarity functions. To this end; we propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,64
TsingNUS: A location-based service system towards live city,Guoliang Li; Nan Zhang; Ruicheng Zhong; Sitong Liu; Weihuang Huang; Ju Fan; Kian-Lee Tan; Lizhu Zhou; Jianhua Feng,Abstract We present our system towards live city; called TsingNUS; aiming to provide userswith more user-friendly location-aware search experiences. TsingNUS crawls location-based user-generated content from the Web (eg; Foursquare and Twitter); cleans andintegrates them to provide users with rich well-structured data. TsingNUS provides threeuser-friendly search paradigms: location-aware instant search; location-aware similaritysearch and direction-aware search. Instant search returns relevant answers instantly asusers type in queries letter by letter; which can help users to save typing efforts significantly.Location-aware similarity search enables fuzzy matching between queries and theunderlying data; which can tolerate typing errors.

Seal: Spatio-textual similarity search,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou; Shanshan Chen; Jun Hu,Abstract Location-based services (LBS) have become more and more ubiquitous recently.Existing methods focus on finding relevant points-of-interest (POIs) based on users'locations and query keywords. Nowadays; modern LBS applications generate a new kind ofspatio-textual data; regions-of-interest (ROIs); containing region-based spatial informationand textual description; eg; mobile user profiles with active regions and interest tags. Tosatisfy search requirements on ROIs; we study a new research problem; called spatio-textualsimilarity search: Given a set of ROIs and a query ROI; we find the similar ROIs byconsidering spatial overlap and textual similarity. Spatio-textual similarity search has manyimportant applications; eg; social marketing in location-aware social networks. It calls for anefficient search method to support large scales of spatio-textual data in LBS systems. To …,VLDB,2012,63
icrowd: An adaptive crowdsourcing framework,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-lee Tan; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourcing is widely accepted as a means for resolving tasks that machines arenot good at. Unfortunately; Crowdsourcing may yield relatively low-quality results if there isno proper quality control. Although previous studies attempt to eliminate" bad" workers byusing qualification tests; the accuracies estimated from qualifications may not be accurate;because workers have diverse accuracies across tasks. Thus; the quality of the results couldbe further improved by selectively assigning tasks to the workers who are well acquaintedwith the tasks. To this end; we propose an adaptive crowdsourcing framework; callediCrowd. iCrowd on-the-fly estimates accuracies of a worker by evaluating her performanceon the completed tasks; and predicts which tasks the worker is well acquainted with. When aworker requests for a task; iCrowd assigns her a task; to which the worker has the highest …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,60
Qasca: a quality-aware task assignment system for crowdsourcing applications,Yudian Zheng; Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Reynold Cheng; Jianhua Feng,Abstract A crowdsourcing system; such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); provides aplatform for a large number of questions to be answered by Internet workers. Such systemshave been shown to be useful to solve problems that are difficult for computers; includingentity resolution; sentiment analysis; and image recognition. In this paper; we investigate theonline task assignment problem: Given a pool of n questions; which of the k questionsshould be assigned to a worker? A poor assignment may not only waste time and money;but may also hurt the quality of a crowdsourcing application that depends on the workers'answers. We propose to consider quality measures (also known as evaluation metrics) thatare relevant to an application during the task assignment process. Particularly; we explorehow Accuracy and F-score; two widely-used evaluation metrics for crowdsourcing …,SIGMOD 2015,2015,57
Crowdsourced Data Management: A Survey,Guoliang Li; Jiannan Wang; Yudian Zheng; Michael Franklin,Any important data management and analytics tasks cannot be completely addressed byautomated processes. These tasks; such as entity resolution; sentiment analysis; and imagerecognition can be enhanced through the use of human cognitive ability. Crowdsouringplatforms are an effective way to harness the capabilities of people (ie; the crowd) to applyhuman computation for such tasks. Thus; crowdsourced data management has become anarea of increasing interest in research and industry. We identify three important problems incrowdsourced data management.(1) Quality Control: Workers may return noisy or incorrectresults so effective techniques are required to achieve high quality;(2) Cost Control: Thecrowd is not free; and cost control aims to reduce the monetary cost;(3) Latency Control: Thehuman workers can be slow; particularly compared to automated computing time scales …,IEEE TKDE 2016,2016,55
Location-aware publish/subscribe,Guoliang Li; Yang Wang; Ting Wang; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Location-based services have become widely available on mobile devices. Existingmethods employ a pull model or user-initiated model; where a user issues a query to aserver which replies with location-aware answers. To provide users with instant replies; apush model or server-initiated model is becoming an inevitable computing model in the next-generation location-based services. In the push model; subscribers register spatio-textualsubscriptions to capture their interests; and publishers post spatio-textual messages. Thiscalls for a high-performance location-aware publish/subscribe system to deliver publishers'messages to relevant subscribers. In this paper; we address the research challenges thatarise in designing a location-aware publish/subscribe system.

Efficient location-aware influence maximization,Guoliang Li; Shuo Chen; Jianhua Feng; Kian-lee Tan; Wen-syan Li,Abstract users in a social network to maximize the expected number of users influenced bythe selected users (called influence spread); has been extensively studied; existing worksneglected the fact that the location information can play an important role in influencemaximization. Many real-world applications such as location-aware word-of-mouthmarketing have location-aware requirement. In this paper we study the location-awareinfluence maximization problem. One big challenge in location-aware influencemaximization is to develop an efficient scheme that offers wide influence spread. To addressthis challenge; we propose two greedy algorithms with 1-1/e approximation ratio. To meetthe instant-speed requirement; we propose two efficient algorithms with ε·(1-1/e)approximation ratio for any ε∈(0; 1]. Experimental results on real datasets show our …,SIGMOD 2014,2014,53
G-tree: An efficient index for knn search on road networks,Ruicheng Zhong; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of kNN search on road networks. Given a querylocation and a set of candidate objects in a road network; the kNN search finds the k nearestobjects to the query location. To address this problem; we propose a balanced search treeindex; called G-tree. The G-tree of a road network is constructed by recursively partitioningthe road network into sub-networks and each G-tree node corresponds to a sub-network.Inspired by classical kNN search on metric space; we introduce a best-first search algorithmon road networks; and propose an elaborately-designed assembly-based method toefficiently compute the minimum distance from a G-tree node to the query location. G-treeonly takes O (| V| log| V|) space; where| V| is the number of vertices in a network; and thuscan easily scale up to large road networks with more than 20 millions vertices …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,52
Trie-join: a trie-based method for efficient string similarity joins,Jianhua Feng; Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li,Abstract A string similarity join finds similar pairs between two collections of strings. Manyapplications; eg; data integration and cleaning; can significantly benefit from an efficientstring-similarity-join algorithm. In this paper; we study string similarity joins with edit-distanceconstraints.

Progressive keyword search in relational databases,Guoliang Li; Xiaofang Zhou; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang,A common approach to performing keyword search over relational databases is to find theminimum Steiner trees in database graphs. These methods; however; are rather expensiveas the minimum Steiner tree problem is known to be NP-hard. Further; these methodscannot benefit from DBMS capabilities. We propose a new concept called Compact SteinerTree (CSTree); which can be used to approximate the Steiner tree problem for answeringtop-k keyword queries efficiently. We propose a structure-aware index; together with aneffective ranking mechanism for fast; progressive and accurate retrieval of $ top $-$ k $highest ranked CSTrees. The proposed techniques can be implemented using a standardRDBMS to benefit from its indexing and query processing capability.

Structure-aware indexing for keyword search in databases,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang,Abstract Most of existing methods of keyword search over relational databases find theSteiner trees composed of relevant tuples as the answers. They identify the Steiner trees bydiscovering the rich structural relationships between tuples; and neglect the fact that suchstructural relationships can be pre-computed and indexed. Tuple units that are composed ofmost relevant tuples are proposed to address this problem. Tuple units can be precomputedand indexed. Existing methods identify a single tuple unit to answer keyword queries. They;however; may involve false negatives as in many cases a single tuple unit cannot answer akeyword query. Instead; multiple tuple units should be integrated to answer keywordqueries. To address this problem; in this paper; we study how to integrate multiple relatedtuple units to effectively answer keyword queries.

Efficient similarity search for tree-structured data,Guoliang Li; Xuhui Liu; Jianhua Feng; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Tree-structured data are becoming ubiquitous nowadays and manipulating thembased on similarity is essential for many applications. Although similarity search on textualdata has been extensively studied; searching for similar trees is still an open problem due tothe high complexity of computing the similarity between trees; especially for large numbersof tress. In this paper; we propose to transform tree-structured data into strings with a one-to-one mapping. We prove that the edit distance of the corresponding strings forms a bound forthe similarity measures between trees; including tree edit distance; largest common subtreesand smallest common super-trees. Based on the theoretical analysis; we can employ anyexisting algorithm of approximate string search for effective similarity search on trees.Moreover; we embed the bound into a filter-and-refine framework for facilitating similarity …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,46
Top-k string similarity search with edit-distance constraints,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Wen-Syan Li,String similarity search is a fundamental operation in many areas; such as data cleaning;information retrieval; and bioinformatics. In this paper we study the problem of top-k stringsimilarity search with edit-distance constraints; which; given a collection of strings and aquery string; returns the top-k strings with the smallest edit distances to the query string.Existing methods usually try different edit-distance thresholds and select an appropriatethreshold to find top-k answers. However it is rather expensive to select an appropriatethreshold. To address this problem; we propose a progressive framework by improving thetraditional dynamic-programming algorithm to compute edit distance. We pruneunnecessary entries in the dynamic-programming matrix and only compute those pivotalentries. We extend our techniques to support top-k similarity search.

Faerie: efficient filtering algorithms for approximate dictionary-based entity extraction,Guoliang Li; Dong Deng; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Dictionary-based entity extraction identifies predefined entities (eg; person namesor locations) from a document. A recent trend for improving extraction recall is to supportapproximate entity extraction; which finds all substrings in the document that approximatelymatch entities in a given dictionary. Existing methods to address this problem support eithertoken-based similarity (eg; Jaccard Similarity) or character-based dissimilarity (eg; EditDistance). It calls for a unified method to support various similarity/dissimilarity functions;since a unified method can reduce the programming efforts; hardware requirements; and themanpower. In addition; many substrings in the document have overlaps; and we have anopportunity to utilize the shared computation across the overlaps to avoid unnecessaryredundant computation.

SAIL: Structure-aware indexing for effective and progressive top-k keyword search over XML documents,Guoliang Li; Chen Li; Jianhua Feng; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Keyword search in XML documents has recently gained a lot of research attention.Given a keyword query; existing approaches first compute the lowest common ancestors(LCAs) or their variants of XML elements that contain the input keywords; and then identifythe subtrees rooted at the LCAs as the answer. In this the paper we study how to use the richstructural relationships embedded in XML documents to facilitate the processing of keywordqueries. We develop a novel method; called SAIL; to index such structural relationships forefficient XML keyword search. We propose the concept of minimal-cost trees to answerkeyword queries and devise structure-aware indices to maintain the structural relationshipsfor efficiently identifying the minimal-cost trees.

Users often feel" left in the dark" when they have limited knowledge about theunderlying data and have to use a try-and-see approach for finding information. A recenttrend of supporting autocomplete in these systems is a first step toward solving this problem.In this paper; we study a new information-access paradigm; called" type-ahead search" inwhich the system searches the underlying data" on the fly" as the user types in querykeywords. It extends autocomplete interfaces by allowing keywords to appear at differentplaces in the underlying data. This framework allows users to explore data as they type;even in the presence of minor errors. We study research challenges in this framework forlarge amounts of data. Since each keystroke of the user could invoke a query on the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,43
Efficient safe-region construction for moving top-k spatial keyword queries,Weihuang Huang; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Many real-world applications have requirements to support moving spatial keywordqueries. For example a tourist looks for top-k" seafood restaurants" while walking in a city.She will continuously issue moving queries. However existing spatial keyword searchmethods focus on static queries and it calls for new effective techniques to support movingqueries efficiently. In this paper we propose an effective method to support moving top-kspatial keyword queries. In addition to finding top-k answers of a moving query; we alsocalculate a safe region such that if a new query with a location falling in the safe region; wecan directly use the answer set to answer the query. To this end; we propose an effectivemodel to represent the safe region and devise efficient search algorithms to compute thesafe region. We have implemented our method and experimental results on real datasets …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,42
Interactive SQL query suggestion: Making databases user-friendly,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou,SQL is a classical and powerful tool for querying relational databases. However; it is ratherhard for inexperienced users to pose SQL queries; as they are required to be proficient inSQL syntax and have a thorough understanding of the underlying schema. To give usersgratification; we propose SQLSUGG; an effective and user-friendly keyword-based methodto help various users formulate SQL queries. SQLSUGG suggests SQL queries as userstype in keywords; and can save users' typing efforts and help users avoid tedious SQLdebugging. To achieve high suggestion effectiveness; we propose queryable templates tomodel the structures of SQL queries. We propose a template ranking model to suggesttemplates relevant to query keywords. We generate SQL queries from each suggestedtemplate based on the degree of matchings between keywords and attributes. For …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,41
Efficient fuzzy type-ahead search in tastier,Guoliang Li; Shengyue Ji; Chen Li; Jiannan Wang; Jianhua Feng,TASTIER is a research project on the new information-access paradigm called type-aheadsearch; in which systems find answers to a keyword query on-the-fly as users type in thequery. In this paper we study how to support fuzzy type-ahead search in TASTIER.Supporting fuzzy search is important when users have limited knowledge about the exactrepresentation of the entities they are looking for; such as people records in an onlinedirectory. We have developed and deployed several such systems; some of which havebeen used by many people on a daily basis. The systems received overwhelmingly positivefeedbacks from users due to their friendly interfaces with the fuzzy-search feature. Wedescribe the design and implementation of the systems; and demonstrate several suchsystems.

We propose an effective search engine called S ailer toadaptively and versatilely answer keyword queries over the heterogenous data. We modelthe Web pages and XML documents as graphs. We propose the concept of pivotal trees toeffectively answer keyword queries and present an effective method to identify the top-kpivotal trees with the highest ranks from the graphs. Moreover; we propose effective indexesto facilitate the effective unified ranked retrieval. We have conducted an extensiveexperimental study using real datasets; and the experimental results show that S ailerachieves both high search efficiency and accuracy; and outperforms the existingapproaches significantly.,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,41
Finding top-k answers in keyword search over relational databases using tuple units,Jianhua Feng; Guoliang Li; Jianyong Wang,Existing studies on keyword search over relational databases usually find Steiner treescomposed of connected database tuples as answers. They on-the-fly identify Steiner treesby discovering rich structural relationships between database tuples; and neglect the factthat such structural relationships can be precomputed and indexed. Recently; tuple units areproposed to improve search efficiency by indexing structural relationships; and existingmethods identify a single tuple unit to answer keyword queries. However; in many cases;multiple tuple units should be integrated to answer a keyword query. Thus; these methodswill involve false negatives. To address this problem; in this paper; we study how to integratemultiple related tuple units to effectively answer keyword queries. To achieve a highperformance; we devise two novel indexes; single-keyword-based structure-aware index …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,39
Fast similar subgraph search with maximum common connected subgraph constraints,Huiqi Hu; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Similar sub graph search has attracted considerable attention recently with the widespreadusage of graph data. Existing methods used graph edit distance or Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) to quantify graph similarity. However they either are very expensive to computethe results or involve many meaningless disconnected sub graph structures. To addressthese limitations; in this paper we study the similar sub graph search problem with MaximumCommon Connected Sub graph (MCCS) constraints; which not only generates high-qualityresults but also efficiently identifies the results. To achieve our goal; we propose the conceptof edge matching and develop two efficient filters to effectively prune dissimilar graphs. Wecombine the backtracking algorithm of calculating MCCS with the edge matching and thenembed them into our method. Experimental results show that our method performs well …,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2013 IEEE International Congress on,2013,35
Providing built-in keyword search capabilities in RDBMS,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Xiaofang Zhou; Jianyong Wang,Abstract A common approach to performing keyword search over relational databases is tofind the minimum Steiner trees in database graphs transformed from relational data. Thesemethods; however; are rather expensive as the minimum Steiner tree problem is known tobe NP-hard. Further; these methods are independent of the underlying relational databasemanagement system (RDBMS); thus cannot benefit from the capabilities of the RDBMS. Asan alternative; in this paper we propose a new concept called Compact Steiner Tree(CSTree); which can be used to approximate the Steiner tree problem for answering top-kkeyword queries efficiently. We propose a novel structure-aware index; together with aneffective ranking mechanism for fast; progressive and accurate retrieval of top-k highestranked CSTrees. The proposed techniques can be implemented using a standard …,The VLDB Journal,2011,35

We study how to support search-as-you-type on data residingin a relational DBMS. We focus on how to support this type of search using the nativedatabase language; SQL. A main challenge is how to leverage existing databasefunctionalities to meet the high-performance requirement to achieve an interactive speed.We study how to use auxiliary indexes stored as tables to increase search performance.

Efficient fuzzy type-ahead search in XML data,Jianhua Feng; Guoliang Li,In a traditional keyword-search system over XML data; a user composes a keyword query;submits it to the system; and retrieves relevant answers. In the case where the user haslimited knowledge about the data; often the user feels “left in the dark” when issuing queries;and has to use a try-and-see approach for finding information. In this paper; we study fuzzytype-ahead search in XML data; a new information-access paradigm in which the systemsearches XML data on the fly as the user types in query keywords. It allows users to exploredata as they type; even in the presence of minor errors of their keywords. Our proposedmethod has the following features: 1) Search as you type: It extends Autocomplete bysupporting queries with multiple keywords in XML data. 2) Fuzzy: It can find high-qualityanswers that have keywords matching query keywords approximately. 3) Efficient: Our …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2012,33
Supporting efficient top-k queries in type-ahead search,Guoliang Li; Jiannan Wang; Chen Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Type-ahead search can on-the-fly find answers as a user types in a keyword query.A main challenge in this search paradigm is the high-efficiency requirement that queriesmust be answered within milliseconds. In this paper we study how to answer top-k queries inthis paradigm; ie; as a user types in a query letter by letter; we want to efficiently find the kbest answers. Instead of inventing completely new algorithms from scratch; we studychallenges when adopting existing top-k algorithms in the literature that heavily rely on twobasic list-access methods: random access and sorted access. We present two algorithms tosupport random access efficiently. We develop novel techniques to support efficient sortedaccess using list pruning and materialization. We extend our techniques to support fuzzytype-ahead search which allows minor errors between query keywords and answers. We …,SIGIR 2012,2012,31

Efficient Filtering Algorithms for Location-Aware Publish/Subscribe,Minghe Yu; Guoliang Li; Ting Wang; Jianhua Feng; Zhiguo Gong,Location-based services have been widely adopted in many systems. Existing works employa pull model or user-initiated model; where a user issues a query to a server which replieswith location-aware answers. To provide users with instant replies; a push model or server-initiated model is becoming an inevitable computing model in the next-generation location-based services. In the push model; subscribers register spatio-textual subscriptions tocapture their interests; and publishers post spatio-textual messages. This calls for a high-performance location-aware publish/subscribe system to deliver publishers' messages torelevant subscribers. In this paper; we address the research challenges that arise indesigning a location-aware publish/subscribe system. We propose an R-tree based index byintegrating textual descriptions into R-tree nodes. We devise efficient filtering algorithms …,IEEE TKDE 2014,2014,30
Effective Location Identification from Microblogs,Guoliang Li; Jun Hu; Kian-lee Tan; Zhifeng Bao; Jianhua Feng,The rapid development of social networks has resulted in a proliferation of user-generatedcontent (UGC). The UGC data; when properly analyzed; can be beneficial to manyapplications. For example; identifying a user's locations from microblogs is very important foreffective location-based advertisement and recommendation. In this paper; we study theproblem of identifying a user's locations from microblogs. This problem is rather challengingbecause the location information in a microblog is incomplete and we cannot get anaccurate location from a local microblog. To address this challenge; we propose a globallocation identification method; called Glitter. Glitter combines multiple microblogs of a userand utilizes them to identify the user's locations. Glitter not only improves the quality ofidentifying a user's location but also supplements the location of a microblog so as to …,ICDE 2014,2014,30
KEMB: a keyword-based XML message broker,Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu Zhou,This paper studies the problem of XML message brokering with user subscribed profiles ofkeyword queries and presents a KEyword-based XML Message Broker (KEMB) to addressthis problem. In contrast to traditional-path-expressions-based XML message brokers; KEMBstores a large number of user profiles; in the form of keyword queries; which capture the datarequirement of users/applications; as opposed to path expressions; such as XPath/XQueryexpressions. KEMB brings new challenges: 1) how to effectively identify relevant answers ofkeyword queries in XML data streams; and 2) how to efficiently answer large numbers ofconcurrent keyword queries. We adopt compact lowest common ancestors (CLCAs) toeffectively identify relevant answers.

Truth inference in crowdsourcing: is the problem solved?,Yudian Zheng; Guoliang Li; Yuanbing Li; Caihua Shan; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Crowdsourcing has emerged as a novel problem-solving paradigm; whichfacilitates addressing problems that are hard for computers; eg; entity resolution andsentiment analysis. However; due to the openness of crowdsourcing; workers may yield low-quality answers; and a redundancy-based method is widely employed; which first assignseach task to multiple workers and then infers the correct answer (called truth) for the taskbased on the answers of the assigned workers. A fundamental problem in this method isTruth Inference; which decides how to effectively infer the truth. Recently; the databasecommunity and data mining community independently study this problem and proposevarious algorithms. However; these algorithms are not compared extensively under thesame framework and it is hard for practitioners to select appropriate algorithms. To …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,29
Real time personalized search on social networks,Yuchen Li; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan,Internet users are shifting from searching on traditional media to social network platforms(SNPs) to retrieve up-to-date and valuable information. SNPs have two uniquecharacteristics: frequent content update and small world phenomenon. However; existingworks are not able to support these two features simultaneously. To address this problem;we develop a general framework to enable real time personalized top-k query. Ourframework is based on a general ranking function that incorporates time freshness; socialrelevance and textual similarity. To ensure efficient update and query processing; there aretwo key challenges. The first is to design an index structure that is update-friendly whilesupporting instant query processing. The second is to efficiently compute the socialrelevance in a complex graph. To address these challenges; we first design a novel 3D …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,29
A Pivotal Prefix Based Filtering Algorithm for String Similarity Search,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract We study the string similarity search problem with edit-distance constraints; which;given a set of data strings and a query string; finds the similar strings to the query. Existingalgorithms use a signature-based framework. They first generate signatures for each stringand then prune the dissimilar strings which have no common signatures to the query.However existing methods involve large numbers of signatures and many signatures areunnecessary. Reducing the number of signatures not only increases the pruning power butalso decreases the filtering cost. To address this problem; we propose a novel pivotal prefixfilter which significantly reduces the number of signatures. We prove the pivotal filterachieves larger pruning power and less filtering cost than state-of-the-art filters. We developa dynamic programming method to select high-quality pivotal prefix signatures to prune …,SIGMOD 2014,2014,29
Location-aware pub/sub system: When continuous moving queries meet dynamic event streams,Long Guo; Dongxiang Zhang; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhifeng Bao,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new location-aware pub/sub system; Elaps; thatcontinuously monitors moving users subscribing to dynamic event streams from socialmedia and E-commerce applications. Users are notified instantly when there is a matchingevent nearby. To the best of our knowledge; Elaps is the first to take into account continuousmoving queries against dynamic event streams. Like existing works on continuous movingquery processing; Elaps employs the concept of safe region to reduce communicationoverhead. However; unlike existing works which assume data from publishers are static;updates to safe regions may be triggered by newly arrived events. In Elaps; we develop aconcept called\textit {impact region} that allows us to identify whether a safe region isaffected by newly arrived events. Moreover; we propose a novel cost model to optimize …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,28
A location-aware publish/subscribe framework for parameterized spatio-textual subscriptions,Huiqi Hu; Yiqun Liu; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Kian-Lee Tan,With the rapid progress of mobile Internet and the growing popularity of smartphones;location-aware publish/subscribe systems have recently attracted significant attention.Different from traditional content-based publish/subscribe; subscriptions registered bysubscribers and messages published by publishers include both spatial information andtextual descriptions; and messages should be delivered to relevant subscribers whosesubscriptions have high relevancy to the messages. To evaluate the relevancy betweenspatio-textual messages and subscriptions; we should combine the spatial proximity andtextual relevancy. Since subscribers have different preferences-some subscribers prefermessages with high spatial proximity and some subscribers pay more attention to messageswith high textual relevancy; it calls for new location-aware publish/subscribe techniques …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,28
Location-aware instant search,Ruicheng Zhong; Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Location-Based Services (LBS) have been widely accepted by mobile usersrecently. Existing LBS-based systems require users to type in complete keywords. Howeverfor mobile users it is rather difficult to type in complete keywords on mobile devices. Toalleviate this problem; in this paper we study the location-aware instant search problem;which returns users location-aware answers as users type in queries letter by letter. Themain challenge is to achieve high interactive speed. To address this challenge; in this paperwe propose a novel index structure; prefix-region tree (called PR-Tree); to efficiently supportlocation-aware instant search.

Crowdsourced poi labelling: Location-aware result inference and task assignment,Huiqi Hu; Yudian Zheng; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Reynold Cheng,Identifying the labels of points of interest (POIs); aka POI labelling; provides significantbenefits in location-based services. However; the quality of raw labels manually added byusers or generated by artificial algorithms cannot be guaranteed. Such low-quality labelsdecrease the usability and result in bad user experiences. In this paper; by observing thatcrowdsourcing is a best-fit for computer-hard tasks; we leverage crowdsourcing to improvethe quality of POI labelling. To our best knowledge; this is the first work on crowdsourced POIlabelling tasks. In particular; there are two sub-problems:(1) how to infer the correct labels foreach POI based on workers' answers; and (2) how to effectively assign proper tasks toworkers in order to make more accurate inference for next available workers.

Efficient parallel partition-based algorithms for similarity search and join with edit distance constraints,Yu Jiang; Dong Deng; Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract The quantity of data in real-world applications is growing significantly while the dataquality is still a big problem. Similarity search and similarity join are two important operationsto address the poor data quality problem. Although many similarity search and joinalgorithms have been proposed; they did not utilize the abilities of modern hardware withmulti-core processors. It calls for new parallel algorithms to enable multi-core processors tomeet the high performance requirement of similarity search and join on big data. To this end;in this paper we propose parallel algorithms to support efficient similarity search and joinwith edit-distance constraints. We adopt the partition-based framework and extend it tosupport parallel similarity search and join on multi-core processors. We also develop twonovel pruning techniques.

Scalable column concept determination for web tables using large knowledge bases,Dong Deng; Yu Jiang; Guoliang Li; Jian Li; Cong Yu,Abstract Tabular data on the Web has become a rich source of structured data that is usefulfor ordinary users to explore. Due to its potential; tables on the Web have recently attracted anumber of studies with the goals of understanding the semantics of those Web tables andproviding effective search and exploration mechanisms over them. An important part of tableunderstanding and search is column concept determination; ie; identifying the mostappropriate concepts associated with the columns of the tables. The problem becomesespecially challenging with the availability of increasingly rich knowledge bases that containhundreds of millions of entities. In this paper; we focus on an important instantiation of thecolumn concept determination problem; namely; the concepts of a column are determinedby fuzzy matching its cell values to the entities within a large knowledge base.

An Efficient Trie-based Method for Approximate Entity Extraction with Edit-Distance Constraints,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Dictionary-based entity extraction has attracted much attention from the database communityrecently; which locates sub strings in a document into predefined entities (eg; person namesor locations). To improve extraction recall; a recent trend is to provide approximate matchingbetween sub strings of the document and entities by tolerating minor errors. In this paper westudy dictionary-based approximate entity extraction with edit-distance constraints. Existingmethods have several limitations. First; they need to tune many parameters to achieve highperformance. Second; they are inefficient for large edit-distance thresholds. We propose atrie-based method to address these problems. We first partition each entity into a set ofsegments; and then use a trie structure to index segments. To extract similar entities; wesearch segments from the document; and extend the matching segments in both entities …,IEEE ICDE 2012,2012,23
Incremental quality inference in crowdsourcing,Jianhong Feng; Guoliang Li; Henan Wang; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourcing has attracted significant attention from the database community inrecent years and several crowdsourced databases have been proposed to incorporatehuman power into traditional database systems. One big issue in crowdsourcing is toachieve high quality because workers may return incorrect answers. A typical solution toaddress this problem is to assign each question to multiple workers and combine workers'answers to generate the final result. One big challenge arising in this strategy is to inferworker's quality. Existing methods usually assume each worker has a fixed quality andcompute the quality using qualification tests or historical performance. However thesemethods cannot accurately estimate a worker's quality. To address this problem; we proposea worker model and devise an incremental inference strategy to accurately compute the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,22
DOCS: a domain-aware crowdsourcing system using knowledge bases,Yudian Zheng; Guoliang Li; Reynold Cheng,Abstract Crowdsourcing is a new computing paradigm that harnesses human effort to solvecomputer-hard problems; such as entity resolution and photo tagging. The crowd (orworkers) have diverse qualities and it is important to effectively model a worker's quality.Most of existing worker models assume that workers have the same quality on differenttasks. In practice; however; tasks belong to a variety of diverse domains; and workers havedifferent qualities on different domains. For example; a worker who is a basketball fanshould have better quality for the task of labeling a photo related to'Stephen Curry'than theone related to'Leonardo DiCaprio'. In this paper; we study how to leverage domainknowledge to accurately model a worker's quality. We examine using knowledge base (KB);eg; Wikipedia and Freebase; to detect the domains of tasks and workers. We develop …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,21
A prefix-filter based method for spatio-textual similarity join,Sitong Liu; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Location-based services have attracted significant attention due to modern mobile phonesequipped with GPS devices. These services generate large amounts of spatio-textual datawhich contain both spatial location and textual descriptions. Since a spatio-textual objectmay have different representations; possibly because of deviations of GPS or different userdescriptions; it calls for efficient methods to integrate spatio-textual data from differentsources. In this paper we study a new research problem called spatio-textual similarity join:given two sets of spatio-textual objects; find the similar object pairs. We make the followingcontributions:(1) We develop a filter-and-refine framework and devise several efficientalgorithms. We extend the prefix filter technique to generate spatial and textual signaturesfor the objects and build inverted index on top of these signatures.

A significant challenge in similarity join is to implement an effectivefuzzy match operation to find all similar string pairs which may not match exactly. In thisarticle; we propose a new similarity function; called fuzzy-token-matching-based similaritywhich extends token-based similarity functions (eg; jaccard similarity and cosine similarity)by allowing fuzzy match between two tokens. We study the problem of similarity join usingthis new similarity function and present a signature-based method to address this problem.We propose new signature schemes and develop effective pruning techniques to improvethe performance. We also extend our techniques to support weighted tokens …,ACM TODS,2013,21

They have many real-worldapplications; such as spell checking; duplicate detection; entity resolution; and webpageclustering. Although these two problems have been extensively studied in the recentdecade; there is no thorough survey. In this paper; we present a comprehensive survey onstring similarity search and join. We first give the problem definitions and introduce widely-used similarity functions to quantify the similarity. We then present an extensive set ofalgorithms for string similarity search and join.

Howeverexisting techniques either cannot achieve high quality or incur huge monetary costs. Toaddress these problems; we propose a cost-effective crowdsourced entity resolutionframework; which significantly reduces the monetary cost while keeping high quality. We firstdefine a partial order on the pairs of records. Then we select a pair as a question and askthe crowd to check whether the records in the pair refer to the same entity. After getting theanswer of this pair; we infer the answers of other pairs based on the partial order. Next weiteratively select pairs without answers to ask until we get the answers of all pairs.

An efficient partition based method for exact set similarity joins,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; He Wen; Jianhua Feng,Abstract We study the exact set similarity join problem; which; given two collections of sets;finds out all the similar set pairs from the collections. Existing methods generally utilize theprefix filter based framework. They generate a prefix for each set and prune all the pairswhose prefixes are disjoint. However the pruning power is limited; because if two dissimilarsets share a common element in their prefixes; they cannot be pruned. To address thisproblem; we propose a partition-based framework. We design a partition scheme to partitionthe sets into several subsets and guarantee that two sets are similar only if they share acommon subset. To improve the pruning power; we propose a mixture of the subsets andtheir 1-deletion neighborhoods (the subset of a set by eliminating one element). As there aremultiple allocation strategies to generate the mixture; we evaluate different allocations …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,19
G-tree: An efficient and scalable index for spatial search on road networks,Ruicheng Zhong; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Lizhu Zhou; Zhiguo Gong,In the recent decades; we have witnessed the rapidly growing popularity of location-basedsystems. Three types of location-based queries on road networks; single-pair shortest pathquery; k nearest neighbor (kNN) query; and keyword-based kNN query; are widely used inlocation-based systems. Inspired by R-tree; we propose a height-balanced and scalableindex; namely G-tree; to efficiently support these queries. The space complexity of G-tree isO (| V| log| V|) where| V| is the number of vertices in the road network. Unlike previous worksthat support these queries separately; G-tree supports all these queries within oneframework. The basis for this framework is an assembly-based method to calculate theshortest-path distances between two vertices. Based on the assembly-based method;efficient search algorithms to answer kNN queries and keyword-based kNN queries are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,19
A partition-based method for string similarity joins with edit-distance constraints,Guoliang Li; Dong Deng; Jianhua Feng,Abstract As an essential operation in data cleaning; the similarity join has attractedconsiderable attention from the database community. In this article; we study string similarityjoins with edit-distance constraints; which find similar string pairs from two large sets ofstrings whose edit distance is within a given threshold. Existing algorithms are efficient eitherfor short strings or for long strings; and there is no algorithm that can efficiently andadaptively support both short strings and long strings. To address this problem; we proposea new filter; called the segment filter. We partition a string into a set of segments and use thesegments as a filter to find similar string pairs. We first create inverted indices for thesegments. Then for each string; we select some of its substrings; identify the selectedsubstrings from the inverted indices; and take strings on the inverted lists of the found …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,17
Crowdsourced top-k algorithms: An experimental evaluation,Xiaohang Zhang; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourced top-k computation has attracted significant attention recently; thanksto emerging crowdsourcing platforms; eg; Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower.Crowdsourced top-k algorithms ask the crowd to compare the objects and infer the top-kobjects based on the crowdsourced comparison results. The crowd may return incorrectanswers; but traditional top-k algorithms cannot tolerate the errors from the crowd.

Efficient Similarity Join and Search on Multi-Attribute Data,Guoliang Li; Jian He; Dong Deng; Jian Li,Abstract In this paper we study similarity join and search on multi-attribute data. Traditionalmethods on single-attribute data have pruning power only on single attributes and cannotefficiently support multi-attribute data. To address this problem; we propose a prefix treeindex which has holis-tic pruning ability on multiple attributes. We propose a cost model toquantify the prefix tree which can guide the prefix tree construction. Based on the prefix tree;we devise a filter-verification framework to support similarity search and join on multi-attribute data. The filter step prunes a large number of dissimilar results and identifies somecandi-dates using the prefix tree and the verification step verifies the candidates to generatethe final answer. For similar-ity join; we prove that constructing an optimal prefix tree is NP-complete and develop a greedy algorithm to achieve high performance. For similarity …,SIGMOD 2015,2015,16
Crowdsourcing-based real-time urban traffic speed estimation: From trends to speeds,Huiqi Hu; Guoliang Li; Zhifeng Bao; Yan Cui; Jianhua Feng,Real-time urban traffic speed estimation provides significant benefits in many real-worldapplications. However; existing traffic information acquisition systems only obtain coarse-grained traffic information on a small number of roads but cannot acquire fine-grained trafficinformation on every road. To address this problem; in this paper we study the traffic speedestimation problem; which; given a budget K; identifies K roads (called seeds) where thereal traffic speeds on these seeds can be obtained using crowdsourcing; and infers thespeeds of other roads (called non-seed roads) based on the speeds of these seeds. Thisproblem includes two sub-problems:(1) Speed Inference-How to accurately infer the speedsof the non-seed roads;(2) Seed Selection-How to effectively select high-quality seeds. It israther challenging to estimate the traffic speed accurately; because the traffic changes …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,15
Efficient top-k simrank-based similarity join,Wenbo Tao; Minghe Yu; Guoliang Li,Abstract SimRank is a popular and widely-adopted similarity measure to evaluate thesimilarity between nodes in a graph. It is time and space consuming to compute theSimRank similarities for all pairs of nodes; especially for large graphs. In real-worldapplications; users are only interested in the most similar pairs. To address this problem; inthis paper we study the top-k SimRank-based similarity join problem; which finds k mostsimilar pairs of nodes with the largest SimRank similarities among all possible pairs. To thebest of our knowledge; this is the first attempt to address this problem. We encode eachnode as a vector by summarizing its neighbors and transform the calculation of the SimRanksimilarity between two nodes to computing the dot product between the correspondingvectors. We devise an efficient two-step framework to compute top-k similar pairs using …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,15
Adapt: adaptive database schema design for multi-tenant applications,Jiacai Ni; Guoliang Li; Jun Zhang; Lei Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Multi-tenant data management is a major application of software as a Service(SaaS). Many companies outsource their data to a third party which hosts a multi-tenantdatabase system to provide data management service. The system should have highperformance; low space and excellent scalability. One big challenge is to devise a high-quality database schema. Independent Tables Shared Instances and Shared Tables SharedInstances are two state-of-the-art methods. However; the former has poor scalability; whilethe latter achieves good scalability at the expense of poor performance and high spaceoverhead. In this paper; we trade-off between the two methods and propose an adaptivedatabase schema design approach to achieve good scalability and high performance withlow space.

A unified framework for approximate dictionary-based entity extraction,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Yi Duan; Zhiguo Gong,Abstract Dictionary-based entity extraction identifies predefined entities (eg; person namesor locations) from documents. A recent trend for improving extraction recall is to supportapproximate entity extraction; which finds all substrings from documents that approximatelymatch entities in a given dictionary. Existing methods to address this problem support eithertoken-based similarity (eg; Jaccard Similarity) or character-based dissimilarity (eg; EditDistance). It calls for a unified method to support various similarity/dissimilarity functions;since a unified method can reduce the programing efforts; the hardware requirements; andthe manpower. In this paper; we propose a unified framework to support varioussimilarity/dissimilarity functions; such as jaccard similarity; cosine similarity; dice similarity;edit similarity; and edit distance.

CDB: optimizing queries with crowd-based selections and joins,Guoliang Li; Chengliang Chai; Ju Fan; Xueping Weng; Jian Li; Yudian Zheng; Yuanbing Li; Xiang Yu; Xiaohang Zhang; Haitao Yuan,Abstract Crowdsourcing database systems have been proposed to leverage crowd-poweredoperations to encapsulate the complexities of interacting with the crowd. Existing systemssuffer from two major limitations. Firstly; in order to optimize a query; they often adopt thetraditional tree model to select an optimized table-level join order. However; the tree modelprovides a coarse-grained optimization; which generates the same order for different joinedtuples and limits the optimization potential that different joined tuples can be optimized bydifferent orders. Secondly; they mainly focus on optimizing the monetary cost. In fact; thereare three optimization goals (ie; smaller monetary cost; lower latency; and higher quality) incrowdsourcing; and it calls for a system to enable multi-goal optimization. To address thelimitations; we develop a crowd-powered database system CDB that supports crowd …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,9
Adaptive Database Schema Design for Multi-Tenant Data Management,Jiacai Ni; Guoliang Li; Lijun Wang; Jianhua Feng; Jun Zhang; Lei Li,Multi-tenant data management is a major application of Software as a Service (SaaS). Forexample; many companies want to outsource their data to a third party that hosts a multi-tenant database system to provide data management services. The multi-tenant databasesystem needs to have high performance; low space requirement; and excellent scalability.One big challenge is devising a high-quality database schema. Independent Tables SharedInstances (ITSI) and Shared Tables Shared instances (STSI) are two state-of-the-artapproaches to designing the schema. However; they suffer from some limitations. ITSI haspoor scalability since it needs to maintain large numbers of tables. STSI achieves goodscalability at the expense of poor performance and high space overhead. Thus; an effectiveschema design method that addresses these problems is needed. In this paper; we …,IEEE TKDE,2013,9
K-join: Knowledge-aware similarity join,Zeyuan Shang; Yaxiao Liu; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Similarity join is a fundamental operation in data cleaning and integration. Existing similarity-join methods utilize the string similarity to quantify the relevance but neglect the knowledgebehind the data; which plays an important role in understanding the data. Thanks to publicknowledge bases; eg; Freebase and Yago; we have an opportunity to use the knowledge toimprove similarity join. To address this problem; we study knowledge-aware similarity join;which; given a knowledge hierarchy and two collections of objects (eg; documents); finds allknowledge-aware similar object pairs. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first study onknowledge-aware similarity join. There are two main challenges. The first is how to quantifythe knowledge-aware similarity. The second is how to efficiently identify the similar pairs. Toaddress these challenges; we first propose a new similarity metric to quantify the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,8
Interactive and deterministic data cleaning,Jian He; Enzo Veltri; Donatello Santoro; Guoliang Li; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Nan Tang,Abstract We present Falcon; an interactive; deterministic; and declarative data cleaningsystem; which uses SQL update queries as the language to repair data. Falcon does not relyon the existence of a set of pre-defined data quality rules. On the contrary; it encouragesusers to explore the data; identify possible problems; and make updates to fix them.Bootstrapped by one user update; Falcon guesses a set of possible sql update queries thatcan be used to repair the data. The main technical challenge addressed in this paperconsists in finding a set of sql update queries that is minimal in size and at the same timefixes the largest number of errors in the data. We formalize this problem as a search in alattice-shaped space. To guarantee that the chosen updates are semantically correct; Falconnavigates the lattice by interacting with users to gradually validate the set of sql update …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,8
Human-in-the-loop data integration,Guoliang Li,Abstract Data integration aims to integrate data in different sources and provide users with aunified view. However; data integration cannot be completely addressed by purelyautomated methods. We propose a hybrid human-machine data integration framework thatharnesses human ability to address this problem; and apply it initially to the problem of entitymatching. The framework first uses rule-based algorithms to identify possible matching pairsand then utilizes the crowd to refine these candidate pairs in order to compute actualmatching pairs. In the first step; we propose similarity-based rules and knowledge-basedrules to obtain some candidate matching pairs; and develop effective algorithms to learnthese rules based on some given positive and negative examples. We build a distributed in-memory system DIMA to efficiently apply these rules. In the second step; we propose a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,6
META: an efficient matching-based method for error-tolerant autocompletion,Dong Deng; Guoliang Li; He Wen; HV Jagadish; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Autocompletion has been widely adopted in many computing systems because itcan instantly provide users with results as users type in queries. Since the typing task istedious and prone to error; especially on mobile devices; a recent trend is to tolerate errorsin autocompletion. Existing error-tolerant autocompletion methods build a trie to index thedata; utilize the trie index to compute the trie nodes that are similar to the query; called activenodes; and identify the leaf descendants of active nodes as the results. However thesemethods have two limitations. First; they involve many redundant computations to identify theactive nodes. Second; they do not support top-k queries. To address these problems; wepropose a matching-based framework; which computes the answers based on matchingcharacters between queries and data. We design a compact tree index to maintain active …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,6

Privacy-preserving top-k spatial keyword queries over outsourced database,Sen Su; Yiping Teng; Xiang Cheng; Yulong Wang; Guoliang Li,Abstract In this paper; we study the privacy-preserving top-k spatial keyword query problemin outsourced environments. Existing studies primarily focus on the design of privacy-preserving schemes for either spatial or keyword queries; and they cannot be applied tosolve the privacy-preserving spatial keyword query problem. To address this problem; wepresent a novel privacy-preserving top-k spatial keyword query scheme. In particular; webuild an encrypted tree index to facilitate privacy-preserving top-k spatial keyword queries;where spatial and textual data are encrypted in a unified way. To search with the encryptedtree index; we propose two effective techniques for the similarity computations betweenqueries and tree nodes under encryption.

Signature-based trajectory similarity join,Na Ta; Guoliang Li; Yongqing Xie; Changqi Li; Shuang Hao; Jianhua Feng,Emerging vehicular trajectory data have opened up opportunities to benefit many real-worldapplications; eg; frequent trajectory based navigation systems; road planning; car pooling;etc. The similarity join is a key operation to enable such applications; which finds similartrajectory pairs from two large collections of trajectories. Existing similarity metrics ontrajectories rely on aligning sampling points of two trajectories. However; due to differentsampling rates or different vehicular speeds; the sample points in similar trajectories may notbe aligned. To address this problem; we propose a new bi-directional mapping similarity(BDS); which allows a sample point of a trajectory to align to the closest location (which maynot be a sample point) on the other trajectory; and vice versa. Since it is expensive toenumerate every two trajectories and compute their similarity; we propose Strain-Join; a …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,4
A novel cost-based model for data repairing,Shuang Hao; Nan Tang; Guoliang Li; Jian He; Na Ta; Jianhua Feng,Integrity constraint based data repairing is an iterative process consisting of two parts: detectand group errors that violate given integrity constraints (ICs); and modify values inside eachgroup such that the modified database satisfies those ICs. However; most existing automaticsolutions treat the process of detecting and grouping errors straightforwardly (eg; violationsof functional dependencies using string equality); while putting more attention on heuristicsof modifying values within each group. In this paper; we propose a revised semantics ofviolations and data consistency wrt a set of ICs. The revised semantics relies on stringsimilarities; in contrast to traditional methods that use syntactic error detection using stringequality. Along with the revised semantics; we also propose a new cost model to quantify thecost of data repair by considering distances between strings. We show that the revised …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,3
Extending dictionary-based entity extraction to tolerate errors,Guoliang Li; Dong Deng; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Entity extraction (also known as entity recognition) extracts entities (eg; personnames; locations; companies) from text. Approximate (dictionary-based) entity extraction is arecent trend to improve extraction quality; which extracts substrings in text that approximatelymatch predefined entities in a given dictionary. In this paper; we study the problem ofapproximate entity extraction with edit-distance constraints. A straightforward method firstextracts all substrings from the text and then for each substring identifies its similar entitiesfrom the dictionary using existing methods for approximate string search. However manysubstrings of the text have overlaps; and we have an opportunity to utilize the sharedcomputation across the overlaps to avoid unnecessary duplicate computations. To this end;we propose a heap-based framework to efficiently extract entities.

Cleaning relations using knowledge bases,Shuang Hao; Nan Tang; Guoliang Li; Jian Li,We study the data cleaning problem of detecting and repairing wrong relational data; as wellas marking correct data; using well curated knowledge bases (KBs). We propose detectiverules (DRs); a new type of data cleaning rules that can make actionable decisions onrelational data; by building connections between a relation and a KB. The main invention isthat; a DR simultaneously models two opposite semantics of a relation using types andrelationships in a KB: the positive semantics that explains how attribute values are linked toeach other in correct tuples; and the negative semantics that indicates how wrong attributevalues are connected to other correct attribute values within the same tuples. Naturally; a DRcan mark correct values in a tuple if it matches the positive semantics. Meanwhile; a DR candetect/repair an error if it matches the negative semantics.

The uncertainty and imprecision are intrinsic in those data. In this paper;we study the problem of effective keyword search over uncertain data. We allowapproximate matching between input keywords and the strings in the underlying data; evenin the presence of minor errors of input keywords. We formalize the problem of fuzzykeyword search over uncertain data. We propose efficient algorithms; effective rankingfunctions; and early-termination techniques to facilitate fuzzy keyword search over uncertaindata.

V-Tree: Efficient kNN search on moving objects with road-network constraints,Bilong Shen; Ying Zhao; Guoliang Li; Weimin Zheng; Yue Qin; Bo Yuan; Yongming Rao,Intelligent transportation systems; eg; Uber; have become an important tool for urbantransportation. An important problem is k nearest neighbor (kNN) search on moving objectswith road-network constraints; which; given moving objects on the road networks and aquery; finds k nearest objects to the query location. Existing studies focus on either kNNsearch on static objects or continuous kNN search with Euclidean-distance constraints. Theformer cannot support dynamic updates of moving objects while the latter cannot supportroad networks. Since the objects are dynamically moving on the road networks; there aretwo main challenges. The first is how to index the moving objects on road networks and thesecond is how to find the k nearest moving objects.

PBA: partition and blocking based alignment for large knowledge bases,Yan Zhuang; Guoliang Li; Zhuojian Zhong; Jianhua Feng,Abstract The vigorous development of semantic web has enabled the creation of a growingnumber of large-scale knowledge bases across various domains. As different knowledge-bases contain overlapping and complementary information; automatically integrating theseknowledge bases by aligning their classes and instances can improve the quality andcoverage of the knowledge bases. Existing knowledge-base alignment algorithms havesome limitations:(1) not scalable;(2) poor quality;(3) not fully automatic. To address theselimitations; we develop a scalable partition-and-blocking based alignment framework;named Pba; which can automatically align knowledge bases with tens of millions ofinstances efficiently.

RFP: A Remote Fetching Paradigm for RDMA-Accelerated Systems,Maomeng Su; Mingxing Zhang; Kang Chen; Yongwei Wu; Guoliang Li,Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is an efficient way to improve theperformance of traditional client-server systems. Currently; there are two main designparadigms for RDMA-accelerated systems. The first allows the clients to directly operate theserver's memory and totally bypasses the CPUs at server side. The second follows thetraditional server-reply paradigm; which asks the server to write results back to the clients.However; the first method has to expose server's memory and needs tremendous re-designof upper-layer software; which is complex; unsafe; error-prone; and inefficient. The secondcannot achieve high input/output operations per second (IOPS); because it employs out-bound RDMA-write at server side which is not efficient. We find that the performance of out-bound RDMA-write and in-bound RDMA-read is asymmetric and the latter is 5 times …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.07805,2015,1

Trajectory-driven Influential Billboard Placement,Ping Zhang; Zhifeng Bao; Yuchen Li; Guoliang Li; Yipeng Zhang; Zhiyong Peng,Abstract: In this paper we propose and study the problem of trajectory-driven influentialbillboard placement: given a set of billboards $ U $(each associated with a location and acost); a database of trajectories $\mathcal {T} $ and a budget $ L $; the goal is to find a set ofbillboards within the budget so that the placed ad can influence the largest number oftrajectories. One core challenge is that multiple billboards have influence overlap ontrajectories and it is critical to identify and reduce the influence overlap. Two moreconstraints on top of this challenge; ie; the budget constraint and non-uniform costsassociated with each billboard; make this optimization problem more intricate. We show thatthis problem is NP-hard and propose an enumeration based algorithm with $(1-1/e) $approximation ratio and $ O (|\mathcal {T}|\cdot| U|^{5}) $ time complexity; where …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.02254,2018,*
An Efficient Ride-Sharing Framework for Maximizing Shared Route,Na Ta; Guoliang Li; Tianyu Zhao; Jianhua Feng; Hanchao Ma; Zhiguo Gong,Ride-sharing (RS) has great values in saving energy and alleviating traffic pressure. Existingstudies can be improved for better efficiency. Therefore; we propose a new ride-sharingmodel; where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider; theshared route percentage (ie; the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total traveldistance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver; eg; 0.8. We consider two variants of thisproblem. The first considers multiple drivers and multiple riders and aims to compute driver-rider pairs to maximize the overall shared route percentage (SRP). We model this problemas the maximum weighted bigraph matching problem; where the vertices are drivers andriders; edges are driver-rider pairs; and edge weights are driver-rider's SRP. However; it israther expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*

Existing solutions mostlyfocus on reducing query processing time. In many applications; however; system throughputis a more important measure. We devise a mathematical model that describes throughput interms of a number of system characteristics. We show that query time is only one of the manyparameters that impact throughput. Others include update time and query/update arrivalrates. We show that the traditional approach of improving query time alone is generallyinadequate in optimizing throughput. Moreover; existing solutions lack flexibility in adaptingto environments of different characteristics. We propose T oain; which is a very flexiblealgorithm that can be easily trained to adapt to a given environment for maximizing querythroughput.

To improve the coverage of KBs; animportant task is to integrate the heterogeneous KBs. Several automatic alignment methodshave been proposed which achieve considerable success. However; due to theinconsistency and uncertainty of large-scale KBs; automatic techniques for KBs alignmentachieve low quality (especially recall). Thanks to the open crowdsourcing platforms; we canharness the crowd to improve the alignment quality. To achieve this goal; in this paper wepropose a novel hybrid human-machine framework for large-scale KB integration. We rstpartition the entities of different KBs into many smaller blocks based on their relations. Wethen construct a partial order on these partitions and develop an inference model which …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Crowdsourced Selection on Multi-Attribute Data,Xueping Weng; Guoliang Li; Huiqi Hu; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourced selection asks the crowd to select entities that satisfy a querycondition; eg; selecting the photos of people wearing sunglasses from a given set of photos.Existing studies focus on a single query predicate and in this paper we study thecrowdsourced selection problem on multi-attribute data; eg; selecting the female photos withdark eyes and wearing sunglasses. A straightforward method asks the crowd to answerevery entity by checking every predicate in the query. Obviously; this method involves hugemonetary cost. Instead; we can select an optimized predicate order and ask the crowd toanswer the entities following the order. Since if an entity does not satisfy a predicate; we canprune this entity without needing to ask other predicates and thus this method can reducethe cost. There are two challenges in finding the optimized predicate order. The first is …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Sybil Defense in Crowdsourcing Platforms,Dong Yuan; Guoliang Li; Qi Li; Yudian Zheng,Abstract Crowdsourcing platforms have been widely deployed to solve many computer-hardproblems; eg; image recognition and entity resolution. Quality control is an important issue incrowdsourcing; which has been extensively addressed by existing quality-controlalgorithms; eg; voting-based algorithms and probabilistic graphical models. However; thesealgorithms cannot ensure quality under sybil attacks; which leverages a large number ofsybil accounts to generate results for dominating answers of normal workers. To address thisproblem; we propose a sybil defense framework for crowdsourcing; which can helpcrowdsourcing platforms to identify sybil workers and defense the sybil attack. We develop asimilarity function to quantify worker similarity. Based on worker similarity; we cluster workersinto different groups such that we can utilize a small number of golden questions to …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

Crowdsourced Entity Alignment: A Decision Theory Based Approach,Yan Zhuang; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Crowdsourcing is a new computation paradigm that utilizes the wisdom of thecrowd to solve problems which are difficult for computers (eg; image annotation and entityalignment). In crowdsourced entity alignment tasks; there are usually large numbers ofcandidate pairs to be verified by the crowd workers; and each pair will be assigned tomultiple workers to achieve high quality. Thus; two fundamental problems are raised:(1)question selection–what are the most beneficial questions that should be crowdsourced;and (2) question assignment–which workers should be assigned to answer a selectedquestion? In this paper; we address these two problems by decision theory. Firstly; wedefine the problems on two budget constraints. The first takes the marginal gain intoaccount; and the second focuses on the limited budget. Then; we formulate the decision …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2017,*
T-Crowd: Effective Crowdsourcing for Tabular Data,Caihua Shan; Nikos Mamoulis; Guoliang Li; Reynold Cheng; Zhipeng Huang; Yudian Zheng,Abstract: Crowdsourcing employs human workers to solve computer-hard problems; such asdata cleaning; entity resolution; and sentiment analysis. When crowdsourcing tabular data;eg; the attribute values of an entity set; a worker's answers on the different attributes (eg; thenationality and age of a celebrity star) are often treated independently. This assumption isnot always true and can lead to suboptimal crowdsourcing performance. In this paper; wepresent the T-Crowd system; which takes into consideration the intricate relationshipsamong tasks; in order to converge faster to their true values. Particularly; T-Crowd integrateseach worker's answers on different attributes to effectively learn his/her trustworthiness andthe true data values. The attribute relationship information is also used to guide taskallocation to workers. Finally; T-Crowd seamlessly supports categorical and continuous …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02125,2017,*
A unified framework for string similarity search with edit-distance constraint,Minghe Yu; Jin Wang; Guoliang Li; Yong Zhang; Dong Deng; Jianhua Feng,Abstract String similarity search is a fundamental operation in data cleaning and integration.It has two variants: threshold-based string similarity search and top-k k string similaritysearch. Existing algorithms are efficient for either the former or the latter; most of them cannotsupport both two variants. To address this limitation; we propose a unified framework. Wefirst recursively partition strings into disjoint segments and build a hierarchical segment treeindex (HS-Tree HS-Tree) on top of the segments. Then; we utilize the HS-Tree HS-Tree tosupport similarity search. For threshold-based search; we identify appropriate tree nodesbased on the threshold to answer the query and devise an efficient algorithm (HS-Search).For top-k k search; we identify promising strings with large possibility to be similar to thequery; utilize these strings to estimate an upper bound which is used to prune dissimilar …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*
Towards A Unified Graph Model for Supporting Data Management and Usable Machine Learning,Guoliang Li; Meihui Zhang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Data management and machine learning are two important tasks in data science.However; they have been independently studied so far. We argue that they should becomplementary to each other. On the one hand; machine learning requires datamanagement techniques to extract; integrate; clean the data; to support scalable and usablemachine learning; making it user-friendly and easily deployable. On the other hand; datamanagement relies on machine learning techniques to curate data and improve its quality.This requires database systems to treat machine learning algorithms as their basicoperators; or at the very least; optimizable stored procedures. It poses new challenges asmachine learning tasks tend be iterative and recursive in nature; and some models have tobe tweaked and retrained. This calls for a reexamination of database design to make it …,*,2017,*
Semantic-Aware Trajectory Compression with Urban Road Network,Na Ta; Guoliang Li; Bole Chen; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Vehicles are generating more and more trajectories; which are expensive to storeand mange. Thus it calls for vehicular trajectory compression techniques. We propose asemantic-aware compression framework that includes two steps: Map Matching (MM) andSemantic Trajectory Compression (STC). On the one hand; due to measurement errors;trajectories cannot be precisely mapped to real roads. In the MM step; we utilizemultidimensional information (including distance and direction) to find the most matchingroads and generate aligned trajectories. On the other hand; some unnecessary points intrajectories can be reduced based on the roads. In the STC step; we extract a set of crucialpoints from the aligned trajectory; which capture the major driving semantics of the trajectory.Meanwhile; our decompression method is fairly lightweight and can efficiently support …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2016,*
众包环境下多谓词查询优化,冯剑红， 胡卉芪， 翁学平， 冯建华,近年来; 众包查询优化得到了数据库领域的广泛关注. 主要研究了众包多谓词选择查询问题——借助于人力找到满足多谓词查询条件的对象. 一种简单的方法是枚举数据集中的对象;对于每个对象判断是否满足每条谓词. 它产生的代价是| R|? n; 其中| R| 为数据集中对象的数量;n 为谓词的数量. 很显然; 当处理大数据集或者查询包含较多谓词的时候; 简单方法的代价是非常昂贵的. 由于不同的谓词具有不同的选择性; 如果首先验证高选择性的谓词;那么在验证剩余谓词的时候; 就可以避免验证不满足高选择性谓词的对象. 因此;采用一个好的谓词顺序实现众包选择查询可以显著减少人工代价. 然而; 实际中很难获得最佳的谓词序列. 针对该问题; 提出了一种基于采样的框架来获得高质量的查询序列.为了控制查询序列生成的成本; 设计了基于随机序列的最优选择方法; 该方法通过随机选择序列获得最终的谓词顺序. 由于基于随机序列的选择方法可能产生较大的代价; 为了减少开销 …,计算机工程与应用,2016,*
The Expected Optimal Labeling Order Problem for Crowdsourced Joins and Entity Resolution,Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Tim Kraska; Michael J Franklin; Jianhua Feng,Abstract: In the SIGMOD 2013 conference; we published a paper extending our earlier workon crowdsourced entity resolution to improve crowdsourced join processing by exploitingtransitive relationships [Wang et al. 2013]. The VLDB 2014 conference has a paper thatfollows up on our previous work [Vesdapunt et al.; 2014]; which points out and corrects amistake we made in our SIGMOD paper. Specifically; in Section 4.2 of our SIGMOD paper;we defined the" Expected Optimal Labeling Order"(EOLO) problem; and proposed analgorithm for solving it. We incorrectly claimed that our algorithm is optimal. In their paper;Vesdapunt et al. show that the problem is actually NP-Hard; and based on that observation;propose a new algorithm to solve it. In this note; we would like to put the Vesdapunt et al.results in context; something we believe that their paper does not adequately do.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.7472,2014,*
A positional access method for relational databases,Dongzhe Ma; Jianhua Feng; Guoliang Li,Abstract Most commercial database management systems sort tuples of a relation by theirprimary keys for the purpose of supporting efficient insertions; deletions; and updates.However; primary keys are usually auto-generated integers; which bear little usefulinformation about user data. Secondary indexes have to be created sometimes to helpretrieve tuples by columns other than the primary key. Evidently; a better solution is to sortthe data by columns that appear frequently in retrieval conditions. Unfortunately; this methoddoes not work; at least not immediately; when the relation is vertically partitioned; which is apopular technique to reduce I/O overhead; since it is difficult to keep tuples of two partitionsin exactly the same order unless the sorting columns are replicated; which again wastesstorage space and disk bandwidth unnecessarily. In this paper; we introduce a positional …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,*
An effective approach for searching closest sentence translations from the web,Ju Fan; Guoliang Li; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract There are large numbers of well-translated sentence pairs on the Web; which canbe used for translating sentences in different languages. It is an interesting problem tosearch the closest sentence translations from the Web for high-quality translation; which hasattracted significant attention recently. However; it is not straightforward to develop aneffective approach; as this task heavily depends on the effectiveness of the similarity modelwhich is used to quantify the similarity between two sentences. In this paper; we proposeseveral optimization techniques to address this problem. We devise a phrase-based modelto quantify the similarity between two sentences. We judiciously select high-quality phrasesfrom sentences; which can capture the key features of sentences and thus can be used toquantify similarity between sentences.

LCA-Based Keyword Search for Effectively Retrieving" Information Unit" from Web Pages,Xiaoming Song; Jianhua Feng; Guoliang Li; Qin Hong,With the rapid development of the internet technology; the structured data are more andmore prevalent in the Internet. Moreover; most web sites organize their data systematicallyand relevant data may be separated into different pages but linked through hyperlinks.However; the existing web search engines cannot integrate information from multipleinterrelated pages to answer keyword queries meaningfully. Next-generation web searchengines require link-awareness; or more generally; the capability of integrating correlativeinformation items that are linked through hyperlinks. In this paper; we study the problems ofidentifying the" information unit" of relevant pages containing all the input keywords as theanswer. We model a set of most related web pages as a tree; where the nodes in the treeare the web pages and the edges are the links between the web pages.

DOCS: A Domain-Aware Crowdsourcing System Using Knowledge Bases (Technical Report),Yudian Zheng; Guoliang Li; Reynold Cheng,ABSTRACT Crowdsourcing is a new computing paradigm that harnesses human effort tosolve computer-hard problems; such as entity resolution and photo tagging. The crowd (orworkers) have diverse qualities and it is important to effectively model a worker's quality.Most of existing worker models assume that workers have the same quality on differenttasks. In practice; however; tasks belong to a variety of diverse domains; and workers havedifferent qualities on different domains. For example; a worker who is a basketball fanshould have better quality for the task of labeling a photo related to 'Stephen Curry'than theone related to 'Leonardo DiCaprio'. In this paper; we study how to leverage domainknowledge to accurately model a worker's quality.
