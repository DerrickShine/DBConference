Multiple mechanisms involved in the large-spectrum therapeutic potential of cannabidiol in psychiatric disorders,Alline Cristina Campos; Fabricio Araujo Moreira; Felipe Villela Gomes; Elaine Aparecida Del Bel; Francisco Silveira Guimaraes,Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major phytocannabinoid present in the Cannabis sativa plant. Itlacks the psychotomimetic and other psychotropic effects that the main plant compound Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being able; on the contrary; to antagonize these effects. Thisproperty; together with its safety profile; was an initial stimulus for the investigation of CBDpharmacological properties. It is now clear that CBD has therapeutic potential over a widerange of non-psychiatric and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety; depression andpsychosis. Although the pharmacological effects of CBD in different biological systems havebeen extensively investigated by in vitro studies; the mechanisms responsible for itstherapeutic potential are still not clear. Here; we review recent in vivo studies indicating thatthese mechanisms are not unitary but rather depend on the behavioural response being …,Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B,2012,148
The anxiolytic-like effects of cannabidiol injected into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors,Felipe V Gomes; Leonardo BM Resstel; Francisco S Guimarães,Abstract Rationale Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabissativa that induces anxiolytic-like effects in rodents and humans after systemicadministration. Previous results from our group showed that CBD injection into the bednucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) attenuates conditioned aversive responses. The aim ofthis study was to further investigate the role of this region on the anxiolytic effects of the CBD.Moreover; considering that CBD can activate 5-HT1A receptors; we also verified a possibleinvolvement of these receptors in those effects. Methods Male Wistar rats received injectionsof CBD (15; 30; or 60 nmol) into the BNST and were exposed to the elevated plus-maze(EPM) or to the Vogel conflict test (VCT); two widely used animal models of anxiety. ResultsCBD increased open arms exploration in the EPM as well as the number of punished …,Psychopharmacology,2011,91
Mechanisms in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis involved in control of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions: a review,Carlos C Crestani; Fernando HF Alves; Felipe V Gomes; Leonardo Resstel; Fernando Correa; James P Herman,The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a heterogeneous and complex limbicforebrain structure; which plays an important role in controlling autonomic; neuroendocrineand behavioral responses. The BNST is thought to serve as a key relay connecting limbicforebrain structures to hypothalamic and brainstem regions associated with autonomic andneuroendocrine functions. Its control of physiological and behavioral activity is mediated bylocal action of numerous neurotransmitters. In the present review we discuss the role of theBNST in control of both autonomic and neuroendocrine function. A description of BNSTcontrol of cardiovascular and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axisactivity at rest and duringphysiological challenges (stress and physical exercise) is presented. Moreover; evidence formodulation of hypothalamic magnocellular neurons activity is also discussed. We attempt …,Current neuropharmacology,2013,85
Cannabidiol inhibitory effect on marble-burying behaviour: involvement of CB1 receptors,Plinio C Casarotto; Felipe V Gomes; Leonardo BM Resstel; Francisco S Guimarães,Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by theoccurrence of obsessions (defined as recurrent; excessive thoughts; attempted to be ignoredand recognized as a mind product) and compulsions (defined as repetitive behaviours ormental acts). The involvement of serotonin in the pathogenesis of OCD has been proposed;based on the effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs); but not noradrenalinuptake inhibitors; in OCD patients (Dolberg et al.; 1996; for review see Abramowitz et al.;2009). However; meta-analysis of clinical data indicates that these drugs are not alwayseffective; being often associated with the presence of residual symptoms and lowresponsiveness,Behavioural pharmacology,2010,67
Cannabidiol injected into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis reduces the expression of contextual fear conditioning via 5-HT1A receptors,Felipe V Gomes; Daniel G Reis; Fernando HF Alves; Fernando MA Corrêa; Francisco S Guimaraes; Leonardo BM Resstel,Systemic administration of cannabidiol (CBD) attenuates cardiovascular and behavioralchanges induced by re-exposure to a context that had been previously paired withfootshocks. Previous results from our group using cFos immunohistochemistry suggestedthat the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is involved in this effect. The mechanismsof CBD effects are still poorly understood; but could involve 5-HT1A receptor activation.Thus; the present work investigated if CBD administration into the BNST would attenuate theexpression of contextual fear conditioning and if this effect would involve the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. Male Wistar rats with cannulae bilaterally implanted into the BNST weresubmitted to a 10 min conditioning session (six footshocks; 1.5 mA/3 s). Twenty-four hourslater freezing and cardiovascular responses (mean arterial pressure and heart rate) to the …,Journal of Psychopharmacology,2012,47
Facilitation of CB1 receptor-mediated neurotransmission decreases marble burying behavior in mice,Felipe V Gomes; Plinio C Casarotto; Leonardo BM Resstel; Francisco S Guimarães,Abstract Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disordercharacterized by the occurrence of obsessions and compulsions. Glutamatergicabnormalities have been related to the pathophysiology of OCD. Cannabinoids inhibitglutamate release in the central nervous system; but the involvement of drugs targeting theendocannabinoid system has not yet been tested in animal models of repetitive behavior.Thus; the aim of the present study was to verify the effects of the CB1 receptor agonistWIN55; 212-2; the inhibitor of anandamide uptake AM404 and the anandamide hydrolysisinhibitor URB597; on compulsive-associate behavior in male C57BL/6J mice submitted tothe marble burying test (MBT); an animal model used for anti-compulsive drug screening.WIN55; 212-2 (1 and 3 mg/kg); AM404 (1 and 3 mg/kg) and URB597 (0.1; 0.3 and 1 mg …,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2011,43
Decreased glial reactivity could be involved in the antipsychotic-like effect of cannabidiol,Felipe V Gomes; Ricardo Llorente; Elaine A Del Bel; Maria-Paz Viveros; Meritxell López-Gallardo; Francisco S Guimarães,Abstract NMDA receptor hypofunction could be involved; in addition to the positive; also tothe negative symptoms and cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia patients. An increasingnumber of data has linked schizophrenia with neuroinflammatory conditions and glial cells;such as microglia and astrocytes; have been related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.Cannabidiol (CBD); a major non-psychotomimetic constituent of Cannabis sativa with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties induces antipsychotic-like effects. The presentstudy evaluated if repeated treatment with CBD (30 and 60mg/kg) would attenuate thebehavioral and glial changes observed in an animal model of schizophrenia based on theNMDA receptor hypofunction (chronic administration of MK-801; an NMDA receptorantagonist; for 28days). The behavioral alterations were evaluated in the social …,Schizophrenia research,2015,37
Cannabidiol attenuates catalepsy induced by distinct pharmacological mechanisms via 5-HT1A receptor activation in mice,Felipe V Gomes; Elaine A Del Bel; Francisco S Guimarães,Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativaplant that produces antipsychotic effects in rodents and humans. It also reverses L-dopa-induced psychotic symptoms and improves motor function in Parkinson's patients. This lattereffect raised the possibility that CBD could have beneficial effects on motor related striataldisorders. To investigate this possibility we evaluated if CBD would prevent catalepsyinduced by drugs with distinct pharmacological mechanisms. The catalepsy test is largelyused to investigate impairments of motor function caused by interference on striatal function.Male Swiss mice received acute pretreatment with CBD (5; 15; 30 or 60 mg/kg; ip) 30 minprior to the D 2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.6 mg/kg); the non-selective nitric oxidesynthase (NOS) inhibitor L-nitro-N-arginine (L-NOARG; 80 mg/kg) or the CB 1 receptor …,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2013,28
Cannabidiol injected into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis modulates baroreflex activity through 5-HT1A receptors,Fernando HF Alves; Carlos C Crestani; Felipe V Gomes; Francisco S Guimarães; Fernando MA Correa; Leonardo BM Resstel,Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativaplant that inhibits behavioral and cardiovascular responses to aversive situations; facilitating5-HT 1A-mediated neurotransmission. Previous results from our group suggest that the bednucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may be involved in CBD's anti-aversive effects. Toinvestigate whether the cardiovascular effects of the CBD could involve a direct drug effecton the BNST; we evaluated the effects of CBD microinjection into this structure on baroreflexactivity. We also verified whether these effects were mediated by the activation of 5-HT 1Areceptors. Bilateral microinjection of CBD (60 nmol/100 nL) into the BNST increased thebradycardiac response to arterial pressure increases. However; no changes were observedin tachycardiac responses evoked by arterial pressure decreases. Pretreatment of the …,Pharmacological research,2010,28
Cannabidiol attenuates sensorimotor gating disruption and molecular changes induced by chronic antagonism of NMDA receptors in mice,Felipe V Gomes; Ana Carolina Issy; Frederico R Ferreira; Maria-Paz Viveros; Elaine A Del Bel; Francisco S Guimarães,Abstract Background: Preclinical and clinical data suggest that cannabidiol (CBD); a majornon-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa; induces antipsychotic-like effects.However; the antipsychotic properties of repeated CBD treatment have been poorlyinvestigated. Behavioral changes induced by repeated treatment with glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists have been proposed as an animal model ofschizophrenia-like signs. In the present study; we evaluated if repeated treatment with CBDwould attenuate the behavioral and molecular modifications induced by chronicadministration of one of these antagonists; MK-801. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice receiveddaily ip injections of MK-801 (0.1; 0.5; or 1mg/kg) for 14; 21; or 28 days. Twenty-four hoursafter the last injection; animals were submitted to the prepulse inhibition (PPI) test. After …,International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,2015,24
Neuroanatomical substrates involved in cannabinoid modulation of defensive responses,FA Moreira; DC Aguiar; LB Resstel; SF Lisboa; AC Campos; FV Gomes; FS Guimaraes,Administration of Cannabis sativa derivatives causes anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects inhumans and laboratory animals; depending on the specific compound and dosage used. Inagreement with these findings; several studies in the last decade have indicated that theendocannabinoid system modulates neuronal activity in areas involved in defensiveresponses. The mechanisms of these effects; however; are still not clear. The present reviewsummarizes recent data suggesting that they involve modulation of glutamate and GABA-mediated neurotransmission in brain sites such as the medial prefrontal cortex; amygdaloidcomplex; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; hippocampus and dorsal periaqueductal gray.Moreover; we also discuss results indicating that; in these regions; the endocannabinoidsystem could be particularly engaged by highly stressful situations.,Journal of Psychopharmacology,2012,24
Effects of intracisternal administration of cannabidiol on the cardiovascular and behavioral responses to acute restraint stress,Erica M Granjeiro; Felipe V Gomes; Francisco S Guimaraes; Fernando MA Corrêa; Leonardo BM Resstel,Abstract Systemic administration of cannabidiol (CBD); a non-psychotomimetic compoundfrom Cannabis sativa; attenuates the cardiovascular and behavioral responses to restraintstress. Although the brain structures related to CBD effects are not entirely known; they couldinvolve brainstem structures responsible for cardiovascular control. Therefore; to investigatethis possibility the present study verified the effects of CBD (15; 30 and 60 nmol) injected intothe cisterna magna on the autonomic and behavioral changes induced by acute restraintstress. During exposure to restraint stress (1 h) there was a significant increase in meanarterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Also; 24 h later the animals showed adecreased percentage of entries onto the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. Theseeffects were attenuated by CBD (30 nmol). The drug had no effect on MAP and HR …,Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,2011,24
Effects of pubertal cannabinoid administration on attentional set-shifting and dopaminergic hyper-responsivity in a developmental disruption model of schizophrenia,Felipe V Gomes; Francisco S Guimarães; Anthony A Grace,Abstract Background: Adolescent exposure to cannabinoids in vulnerable individuals isproposed to be a risk factor for psychiatric conditions later in life; particularly schizophrenia.Evidence from studies in animals has indicated that a combination of repeated pubertalcannabinoid administration with either neonatal prefrontocortical lesion; isolation rearing; orchronic NMDA receptor antagonism administration induces enhanced schizophrenia-likebehavioral disruptions. The effects of adolescent exposure to CB1 receptor agonists;however; have not been tested in a developmental disruption model of schizophrenia.Methods: This was tested in the methylazoxymethanol (MAM) model; in which repeatedtreatment with the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55;212-2 (WIN; 1.2 mg/kg) wasextended over 25 days throughout puberty (postnatal days 40–65) in control and MAM …,International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,2015,20
Cannabidiol effects in the prepulse inhibition disruption induced by amphetamine,João Francisco Cordeiro Pedrazzi; AC Issy; FV Gomes; FS Guimarães; EA Del-Bel,Abstract Rationale The information processing appears to be deficient in schizophrenia.Prepulse inhibition (PPI); which measures the inhibition of a motor response by a weaksensory event; is considered particularly useful to understand the biology of informationprocessing in schizophrenia patients. Drugs that facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmissionsuch as amphetamine induce PPI disruption in human and rodents. Clinical andneurobiological findings suggest that the endocannabinoid system and cannabinoids maybe implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. Cannabidiol (CBD); anon-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant; has also been reported tohave potential as an antipsychotic. Objective Our aim was to investigate if CBD pretreatmentwas able to prevent PPI disruption induced by amphetamine. Since one possible …,Psychopharmacology,2015,17
Both α1‐and β1‐adrenoceptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are involved in the expression of conditioned contextual fear,Sara C Hott; Felipe V Gomes; Denise RS Fabri; Daniel G Reis; Carlos C Crestani; Fernando Correa; Leonardo Resstel,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a limbicstructure that is involved in the expression of conditioned contextual fear. Among thenumerous neural inputs to the BNST; noradrenergic synaptic terminals are prominent andsome evidence suggests an activation of this noradrenergic neurotransmission in the BNSTduring aversive situations. Here; we have investigated the involvement of the BNSTnoradrenergic system in the modulation of behavioural and autonomic responses inducedby conditioned contextual fear in rats.,British journal of pharmacology,2012,17
Fine-tuning of defensive behaviors in the dorsal periaqueductal gray by atypical neurotransmitters,MV Fogaça; SF Lisboa; DC Aguiar; FA Moreira; FV Gomes; PC Casarotto; FS Guimarães,Abstract This paper presents an up-to-date review of the evidence indicating that atypicalneurotransmitters such as nitric oxide (NO) and endocannabinoids (eCBs) play an importantrole in the regulation of aversive responses in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Among theresults supporting this role; several studies have shown that inhibitors of neuronal NOsynthase or cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor agonists cause clear anxiolytic responseswhen injected into this region. The nitrergic and eCB systems can regulate the activity ofclassical neurotransmitters such as glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that controlPAG activity. We propose that they exert a 'fine-tuning'regulatory control of defensiveresponses in this area. This control; however; is probably complex; which may explain theusually bell-shaped dose-response curves observed with drugs that act on NO-or CB1 …,Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research,2012,17
Effects of glutamate NMDA and TRPV1 receptor antagonists on the biphasic responses to anandamide injected into the dorsolateral periaqueductal grey of Wistar rats,Manoela V Fogaça; Felipe V Gomes; Fabrício A Moreira; Francisco S Guimarães; Daniele C Aguiar,Abstract Rationale The endocannabinoid and endovanniloid anandamide (AEA) exertsbiphasic effects when injected into the dorsolateral periaqueductal grey (dlPAG) in ratssubmitted to threatening situations. Whereas lower doses of AEA induce anxiolytic-likeeffects by activating cannabinoid CB1 receptors; no effects are observed with higher doses;possibly due to the simultaneous activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1(TRPV1) receptors. This activation would facilitate glutamatergic neurotransmission.Objective Considering that the blockade of TRPV1 or NMDA receptors in the dlPAG inducesanxiolytic-like effects; we tested the hypothesis that facilitation of glutamate transmissionthrough TRPV1 is responsible for the lack of anxiolytic-like effect observed with high AEAdoses. Methods Male Wistar rats with a unilateral cannula aimed at the dlPAG received …,Psychopharmacology,2013,16
Adolescence as a period of vulnerability and intervention in schizophrenia: insights from the MAM model,Felipe V Gomes; Millie Rincón-Cortés; Anthony A Grace,Abstract Adolescence is a time of extensive neuroanatomical; functional and chemicalreorganization of the brain; which parallels substantial maturational changes in behaviorand cognition. Environmental factors that impinge on the timing of these developmentalfactors; including stress and drug exposure; increase the risk for psychiatric disorders.Indeed; antecedents to affective and psychotic disorders; which have clinical andpathophysiological overlap; are commonly associated with risk factors during adolescencethat predispose to these disorders. In the context of schizophrenia; psychosis typicallybegins in late adolescence/early adulthood; which has been replicated by animal models.Rats exposed during gestational day (GD) 17 to the mitotoxin methylazoxymethanol acetate(MAM) exhibit behavioral; pharmacological; and anatomical characteristics consistent …,*,2016,15
Increased contextual fear conditioning in iNOS knockout mice: additional evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide in stress-related disorders and contribution of th...,Sabrina F Lisboa; Felipe V Gomes; Andréia L Silva; Daniela L Uliana; Laura HA Camargo; Francisco S Guimarães; Fernando Q Cunha; Sâmia RL Joca; Leonardo BM Resstel,Abstract Background: Inducible or neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene deletion increases ordecreases anxiety-like behavior in mice; respectively. Since nitric oxide andendocannabinoids interact to modulate defensive behavior; the former effect could involve acompensatory increase in basal brain nitric oxide synthase activity and/or changes in theendocannabinoid system. Thus; we investigated the expression and extinction of contextualfear conditioning of inducible nitric oxide knockout mice and possible involvement ofendocannabinoids in these responses. Methods: We evaluated the effects of a preferentialneuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor; 7-nitroindazol; nitric oxide synthase activity; andmRNA changes of nitrergic and endocannabinoid systems components in the medialprefrontal cortex and hippocampus of wild-type and knockout mice.

Cannabidiol reverses the mCPP‐induced increase in marble‐burying behavior,Mirella Nardo; Plinio C Casarotto; Felipe V Gomes; Francisco S Guimaraes,Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD); one of the main components of Cannabis sp.; presents clinicaland preclinical anxiolytic properties. Recent results using the marble-burying test (MBT)suggest that CBD can also induce anticompulsive-like effects. Meta-chloro-phenyl-piperazine (mCPP) is a nonspecific serotonergic agonist (acting mainly at 5HT1A; 5HT2Cand 5HT1D receptors) reported to increase symptoms in OCD patients and block theanticompulsive-like effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in animal models. The aimof this study was to investigate the interference of CBD on mCPP effects in repetitive burying.Administration of mCPP showed dual effects in the MBT; increasing the number of buriedmarbles at lower (0.1 mg/kg) while decreasing it at higher doses (1 mg/kg); an effect notrelated to a general increase in anxiety-like behavior. As found previously; CBD (30 mg …,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,2014,14
Cannabidiol administration into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis alters cardiovascular responses induced by acute restraint stress through 5-HT1A receptor,Felipe V Gomes; Fernando HF Alves; Francisco S Guimarães; Fernando MA Correa; Leonardo BM Resstel; Carlos C Crestani,Abstract Systemic administration of cannabidiol (CBD) is able to attenuate cardiovascularresponses to acute restraint stress through activation of 5-HT 1A receptors. Previous resultsfrom our group suggest that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is involved in theantiaversive effects of the CBD. Moreover; it has been proposed that synapses within theBNST influence restraint-evoked cardiovascular changes; in particular by an inhibitoryinfluence on the tachycardiac response associated to restraint stress. Thus; the present workinvestigated the effects of CBD injected into the BNST on cardiovascular changes inducedby acute restraint stress and if these effects would involve the local activation of 5-HT 1Areceptors. The exposition to restraint stress increased both blood pressure and heart rate(HR). The microinjection of CBD (30 and 60nmol) into the BNST enhanced the restraint …,European Neuropsychopharmacology,2013,12
Fluorinated cannabidiol derivatives: enhancement of activity in mice models predictive of anxiolytic; antidepressant and antipsychotic effects,Aviva Breuer; Christeene G Haj; Manoela V Fogaça; Felipe V Gomes; Nicole Rodrigues Silva; João Francisco Pedrazzi; Elaine A Del Bel; Jaime C Hallak; José A Crippa; Antonio W Zuardi; Raphael Mechoulam; Francisco S Guimarães,Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major Cannabis sativa constituent; which does not cause the typicalmarijuana psychoactivity. However; it has been shown to be active in a numerouspharmacological assays; including mice tests for anxiety; obsessive-compulsive disorder;depression and schizophrenia. In human trials the doses of CBD needed to achieve effectsin anxiety and schizophrenia are high. We report now the synthesis of 3 fluorinated CBDderivatives; one of which; 4'-F-CBD (HUF-101)(1); is considerably more potent than CBD inbehavioral assays in mice predictive of anxiolytic; antidepressant; antipsychotic and anti-compulsive activity. Similar to CBD; the anti-compulsive effects of HUF-101 depend oncannabinoid receptors.,PloS one,2016,10
Prefrontal cortex dysfunction increases susceptibility to schizophrenia-like changes induced by adolescent stress exposure,Felipe V Gomes; Anthony A Grace,Abstract Stress during adolescence is a risk factor for schizophrenia; and medial prefrontalcortex (mPFC) dysfunction is proposed to interfere with stress control; increasing thesusceptibility to stress. We evaluated the impact of different stressful events duringadolescence (restraint stress [RS]; footshock [FS]; or the combination of FS and RS) onbehaviors correlated with schizophrenia in rats as adults. At adulthood; animals were testedfor anxiety responses (elevated plus-maze); cognitive function (novel-object recognition test)and dopamine (DA) system responsivity (locomotor response to amphetamine and DAneuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) using in vivo electrophysiology). Alladolescent stressors impaired weight gain and induced anxiety-like responses in adults. FSand FS+ RS also disrupted cognitive function.

Microglial cells as a link between cannabinoids and the immune hypothesis of psychiatric disorders,Sabrina F Lisboa; Felipe V Gomes; Francisco S Guimaraes; Alline C Campos,Psychiatric disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Although severaltherapeutic options are available; the exact mechanisms responsible for the genesis ofthese disorders remain to be fully elucidated. In the last decade; a body of evidence hassupported the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of these conditions.Microglial cells play a significant role in maintaining brain homeostasis and surveillance.Dysregulation of microglial functions has been associated with several psychiatricconditions. Cannabinoids regulate the brain-immune axis and inhibit microglial cellactivation. Here we summarized evidence supporting the hypothesis that microglial cellscould be a target for cannabinoid influence on psychiatric disorders such as anxiety;depression; schizophrenia and stress-related disorders.,Frontiers in neurology,2016,9
Involvement of the insular cortex in the consolidation and expression of contextual fear conditioning,Fernando HF Alves; Felipe V Gomes; Daniel G Reis; Carlos C Crestani; Fernando Correa; Francisco S Guimaraes; Leonardo Resstel,Abstract The insular cortex (IC) has been reported to be involved in the modulation ofmemory and autonomic and defensive responses. However; there is conflicting evidenceabout the role of the IC in fear conditioning. To explore the IC involvement in both behavioraland autonomic responses induced by contextual fear conditioning; we evaluated the effectsof the reversible inhibition of the IC neurotransmission through bilateral microinjections ofthe non-selective synapse blocker CoCl 2 (1 mm) 10 min before or immediately after theconditioning session or 10 min before re-exposure to the aversive context. In theconditioning session; rats were exposed to a footshock chamber (context) and footshockswere used as the unconditioned stimulus. Forty-eight hours later; the animals were re-exposed to the aversive context for 10 min; but no shock was given. Behavioral (freezing) …,European Journal of Neuroscience,2013,8

Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis NMDA receptors and nitric oxide modulate contextual fear conditioning in rats,Sara C Hott; Felipe V Gomes; Daniela L Uliana; Gabriel T Vale; Carlos R Tirapelli; Leonardo BM Resstel,Abstract The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) modulates anxiety-like responses;including conditioned emotional responses. Evidence suggests that glutamatergicneurotransmission in the BNST plays a role in the modulation of defensive responses.However; little is known about the involvement of glutamate NMDA receptor activation withinthe BNST; and its resultant increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels; in the expression ofcontextual fear conditioning (CFC). We investigated whether the antagonism of NMDAreceptors or the reduction of NO levels in the BNST would attenuate behavioral andautonomic responses (ie increase in arterial pressure and heart rate; and decrease in tailcutaneous temperature) of rats submitted to a CFC paradigm. Intra-BNST infusion of AP7; anNMDA receptor antagonist; attenuated both behavioral and autonomic changes induced …,Neuropharmacology,2017,7
Cannabidiol attenuates haloperidol-induced catalepsy and c-Fos protein expression in the dorsolateral striatum via 5-HT1A receptors in mice,Andreza B Sonego; Felipe V Gomes; Elaine A Del Bel; Francisco S Guimaraes,Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativaplant. Given that CBD reduces psychotic symptoms without inducing extrapyramidal motorside-effects in animal models and schizophrenia patients; it has been proposed to act as anatypical antipsychotic. In addition; CBD reduced catalepsy induced by drugs with distinctpharmacological mechanisms; including the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. To furtherinvestigate this latter effect; we tested whether CBD (15–60 mg/kg) would attenuate thecatalepsy and c-Fos protein expression in the dorsal striatum induced by haloperidol (0.6mg/kg). We also evaluated if these effects occur through the facilitation of 5-HT 1A receptor-mediated neurotransmission. For this; male Swiss mice were treated with CBD andhaloperidol systemically and then subjected to the catalepsy test. Independent groups of …,Behavioural brain research,2016,7
Noradrenergic neurotransmission within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis modulates the retention of immobility in the rat forced swimming test,Michelly M Nagai; Felipe V Gomes; Carlos C Crestani; Leonardo BM Resstel; Sâmia RL Joca,The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a limbic structure located ventrally to thelateral septal nucleus and dorsally to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (Dong et al.;2001b). It has bidirectional connections with forebrain limbic structures; such as theprefrontal cortex; amygdala; hippocampus; and hypothalamic nuclei and is also connectedwith brainstem nuclei associated with the regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrinefunctions (Dong et al.; 2001a; Alheid; 2003). These data provide neuroanatomical support tothe hypothesis that BNST could play an important role in the integration of physiological andbehavioral responses; especially those related to defensive reactions and stress (Herman etal.; 2005). In fact; the BNST is activated by different stressful stimuli (Greenwood et al.; 2005;Beijamini and Guimaraes; 2006; Muigg et al.; 2007) and plays an important role in the …,Behavioural pharmacology,2013,7

Hypothalamic supraoptic but not paraventricular nucleus is involved in cardiovascular responses to carbachol microinjected into the bed nucleus of stria terminalis of...,Fernando HF Alves; Carlos C Crestani; Cristiane Busnardo; José Antunes-Rodrigues; Felipe V Gomes; Leonardo BM Resstel; Fernando MA Corrêa,Abstract Microinjection of the cholinergic agonist carbachol into the bed nucleus of the striaterminalis (BST) has been reported to cause pressor response in unanesthetized rats; whichwas shown to be mediated by an acute release of vasopressin into the systemic circulationand followed by baroreflex-mediated bradycardia. In the present study; we tested thepossible involvement of the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON)nuclei in the pressor response evoked by carbachol microinjection into the BST ofunanesthetized rats. For this; cardiovascular responses following carbachol (1 nmol/100 nL)microinjection into the BST were studied before and after PVN or SON pretreatment; eitheripsilateral or contralateral in relation to BST microinjection site; with the nonselectiveneurotransmission blocker cobalt chloride (CoCl 2; 1 mM/100 nL).

Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the cardiovascular responses to chemoreflex activation,Erica M Granjeiro; Felipe V Gomes; Fernando HF Alves; Carlos C Crestani; Fernando MA Corrêa; Leonardo BM Resstel,Abstract Several studies from our group have indicated that the BNST play an important rolein baroreflex modulation. However; the involvement of the BNST in the chemoreflex activityis unknown. Thus; in the present study; we investigated the effect of the local bed nucleus ofstria terminalis (BNST) neurotransmission inhibition by bilateral microinjections of the non-selective synaptic blocker cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) on the cardiovascular responses tochemoreflex activation in rats. For this purpose; chemoreflex was activated with KCN (iv)before and after microinjections of CoCl 2 into the BNST.

SK3 Channel overexpression in mice causes hippocampal shrinkage associated with cognitive impairments,Sabine Martin; Marcio Lazzarini; Christian Dullin; Saju Balakrishnan; Felipe V Gomes; Milena Ninkovic; Ahmed El Hady; Luis A Pardo; Walter Stühmer; Elaine Del-Bel,Abstract The dysfunction of the small-conductance calcium-activated K+ channel SK3 hasbeen described as one of the factors responsible for the progress of psychoneurologicaldiseases; but the molecular basis of this is largely unknown. This report reveals through useof immunohistochemistry and computational tomography that long-term increasedexpression of the SK3 small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK3-T/T) inmice induces a notable bilateral reduction of the hippocampal area (more than 50%).Histological analysis showed that SK3-T/T mice have cellular disarrangements and neurondiscontinuities in the hippocampal formation CA1 and CA3 neuronal layer. SK3overexpression resulted in cognitive loss as determined by the object recognition test.Electrophysiological examination of hippocampal slices revealed that SK3 channel …,Molecular neurobiology,2017,4
Plastic and Neuroprotective Mechanisms Involved in the Therapeutic Effects of Cannabidiol in Psychiatric Disorders,Alline C Campos; Manoela V Fogaça; Franciele F Scarante; Sâmia RL Joca; Amanda J Sales; Felipe V Gomes; Andreza B Sonego; Naielly S Rodrigues; Ismael Galve-Roperh; Francisco S Guimarães,Beneficial effects of cannabidiol (CBD) have been described for a wide range of psychiatricdisorders; including anxiety; psychosis; and depression. The mechanisms responsible forthese effects; however; are still poorly understood. Similar to clinical antidepressant oratypical antipsychotic drugs; recent findings clearly indicate that CBD; either acutely orrepeatedly administered; induces plastic changes. For example; CBD attenuates thedecrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and dendrite spines density induced by chronicstress and prevents microglia activation and the decrease in the number of parvalbumin-positive GABA neurons in a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. More recently; it wasfound that CBD modulates cell fate regulatory pathways such as autophagy and otherscritical pathways for neuronal survival in neurodegenerative experimental models …,Frontiers in pharmacology,2017,3
D-cycloserine injected into the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray induces anxiolytic-like effects in rats,Felipe V Gomes; Alessandra M Kakihata; Ana Carolina G Semedo; Sara C Hott; Daniela L Uliana; Francisco S Guimarães; Leonardo BM Resstel,Abstract d-cycloserine (DCS) is a partial agonist of the glycine site coupled to the NMDAreceptor (NMDAR). As a consequence; depending on the doses used it can function as anagonist or antagonist at this site. In rodents; anxiolytic-like effects have been observed afterthe systemic administration of high doses of DCS. The brain sites of these effects have notbeen investigated. Direct brain injection of glycine site antagonists or agonists into thedorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG); a brain structure involved in the modulation ofdefensive-related behaviors; produces anxiolytic-or anxiogenic-like effects; respectively. Thepresent study investigated if the dlPAG could be a brain site of the anxiolytic effectsobserved after DCS systemic administration. Male Wistar rats received intra-dlPAGinjections of DCS (25; 50; 100 or 200 nmol) and were exposed to the elevated plus-maze …,Behavioural brain research,2014,3

Adolescent Stress as a Driving Factor for Schizophrenia Development—A Basic Science Perspective,Felipe V Gomes; Anthony A Grace,Abstract Schizophrenia has been associated with heightened stress responsivity inadolescence that precedes onset of psychosis. We now report that multiple stressors duringadolescence in normal rats leads to deficits in adults analogous to that seen inschizophrenia patients. Moreover; impairment of stress control by lesion of the prelimbicprefontal cortex in adolescence caused previously subthreshold levels of stress to inducethese deficit states when tested as adults. Thus; predisposition to stress hyper-responsivity;or exposure to substantial stressors; during adolescence can trigger a cascade of eventsthat result in a schizophrenia-like profile in adults. This data can provide crucial informationwith respect to identifying markers for schizophrenia vulnerability early in life and; bymitigating the impact of stressors; prevent the transition to psychosis.,Schizophrenia bulletin,2017,2

841. The Ability of Stress during Adolescence or Adulthood to Produce Schizophrenia-Like Pathophysiology is Dependent on the State of the Critical Period,Felipe Gomes; Xiyu Zhu; Anthony Grace,Background Unregulated stress exposure occurring during the sensitive period ofdevelopment leads to the emergence of circuit deficits consistent with schizophrenia in theadult. If accurate; one would predict that re-opening the sensitive period in the adult couldmake it susceptible to a similar disruption. Methods Male rats were submitted to acombination of footshock (FS) and restraint stress (RS) during adolescence (PD31-40) oradulthood (PD65-74). The activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area(VTA) and the pyramidal in the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) were evaluated 1-2 or 5-6weeks post-stress. We also evaluate if the administration of valproic acid (VPA; 300 mg/kg);which is known to re-instate the critical period in adults; would recreate an adolescentphenotype of susceptibility to stress.

Cannabinoids and obsessive-compulsive disorder,Plinio C Casarotto; Felipe V Gomes; Francisco S Guimaraes,Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and fluctuating neuropsychiatriccondition characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive ritualistic behaviors(compulsions). Recent evidence suggests that endocannabinoids (eCBs) can play a role inthis disorder. Cannabinoid receptors are significantly expressed in most parts of the maincircuitry related to OCD; the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry; being able to modulate therelease of key neurotransmitters such as glutamate; dopamine; GABA; and serotonin.Preclinical studies using the marble burying test show that enhancement of CB 1 function bydirect agonists or inhibitors of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of eCBs(including the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol) presents anti-compulsive behavior activity.Although additional studies are needed to elucidate the role of eCBs in OCD; these …,*,2015,1
The Circuitry of Dopamine System Regulation and its Disruption in Schizophrenia: Insights Into Treatment and Prevention,Anthony A Grace; Felipe V Gomes,Abstract Despite evidence for a role of the dopamine system in the pathophysiology ofschizophrenia; there has not been substantial evidence that this disorder originates from apathological change within the dopamine system itself. Current data from human imagingstudies and preclinical investigations instead point to a disruption in afferent regulation ofthe dopamine system; with a focus on the hippocampus. We found that the hippocampus inthe methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent developmental disruption model ofschizophrenia is hyperactive and dysrhythmic; possibly due to loss of parvalbumininterneurons; leading to a hyperresponsive dopamine system. Whereas current therapeuticapproaches target dopamine receptor blockade; treatment at the site of pathology may be amore effective therapeutic avenue. This model also provided insights into potential means …,Schizophrenia bulletin,2018,*
The methylazoxymethanol acetate rat model: molecular and epigenetic effect in the developing prefrontal cortex,Xiyu Zhu; Felipe V Gomes; Anthony A Grace,methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) model has provided a translatable framework forclinical research. The MAM model is based on a single administration of the mitotoxin MAMto pregnant rats at gestational day 17; which produces in the offspring many characteristicsthat are consistent with clinical observations. For example; the MAM model recapitulatesbehavioral deficits (eg; prepulse inhibition of startle; reversal learning; latent inhibition;social interaction); pharmacological responses (eg; increased locomotion to amphetamineand to phencyclidine); and anatomical changes (eg; thinning of limbic cortices; loss ofparvalbumin interneurons) similar to that observed in schizophrenia (Modinos et al. 2015).Furthermore; consistent with the onset of psychosis in schizophrenia patients; most of thealterations related to the positive symptoms observed in the MAM rats become evident …,Journal of neurochemistry,2017,*
Antinociceptive effects of HUF-101; a fluorinated cannabidiol derivative,Nicole R Silva; Felipe V Gomes; Miriam D Fonseca; Raphael Mechoulam; Aviva Breuer; Thiago M Cunha; Francisco S Guimaraes,Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid with multiple pharmacological effectsand several potential therapeutic properties. Its low oral bioavailability; however; can limit itsclinical use. Preliminary results indicate that fluorination of the CBD molecule increases itspharmacological potency. Here; we investigated whether HUF-101 (3; 10; and 30 mg/kg); afluorinated CBD analogue; would induce antinociceptive effects. HUF-101 effects werecompared to those induced by CBD (10; 30; and 90 mg/kg) and the cannabinoid CB 1/2receptor agonist WIN55; 212-2 (1; 3; and 5 mg/kg). These drugs were tested in male Swissmice submitted to the following models predictive to antinociceptive drugs: hot plate; aceticacid-induced writhing; and carrageenan-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia. To evaluatethe involvement of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors in HUF-101 and CBD effects; mice received …,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2017,*
M102. Prefrontal Cortex Dysfunction Increases Susceptibility to Schizophrenia-Like Changes Induced by Adolescent Stress Exposure,Felipe Gomes; Anthony Grace,Background: The emergence of psychosis is often associated with stressful events; andadolescents that are at high risk for schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormally highreactivity to stress. A dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is proposed tointerfere with stress control; increasing the susceptibility to stress and; consequently;contributing to the emergence of psychiatric disorders; including SZ. Thus; we evaluated theimpact of single and combined stressors during adolescence on SZ-like signs in rats andwhether disruption of prelimbic (pl) PFC during adolescence affects stress-inducedpathology in adulthood. Methods: Adolescent male rats were submitted to different stressors(restraint stress [RS; at postnatal days [PD] 31; 32 and 40]; footshock [FS; daily throughPD31-40]; or a combination of FS+ RS). At adulthood; animals were tested for anxiety …,Schizophrenia Bulletin,2017,*

P. 1. g. 048 Attenuation of haloperidol-induced extrapyramidal effects by cannabidiol administration in mice,AB Sonego; FV Gomes; EA Del Bel; FS Guimarães,Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major constituent from Cannabis sativa plant that could act as anatypical antipsychotic. It decreases psychotic-like behavioural changes in preclinical andclinical studies without inducing catalepsy [1]. In addition; CBD induces a pattern of neuronalactivation similar to clozapine [2] and attenuates L-dopa-induced psychotic symptoms;improving motor function in Parkinson's patients [3]. This latter finding raised the possibilitythat CBD could attenuate the extrapyramidal effects induced by typical antipsychotics. Thus;the aim of this study was to verify if CBD could prevent or attenuate catalepsy and decreasecFos expression in the dorsal striatum induced by haloperidol. To this aim; male Swiss mice(25− 35g) were treated systemically with haloperidol (0.6 mg/kg) and 2.5 hours laterreceived CBD (30 or 60mg/kg; ip).
