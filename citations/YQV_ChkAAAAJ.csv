Process modeling in web applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract While Web applications evolve towards ubiquitous; enterprise-wide ormultienterprise information systems; they face new requirements; such as the capability ofmanaging complex processes spanning multiple users and organizations; byinterconnecting software provided by different organizations. Significant efforts are currentlybeing invested in application integration; to support the composition of business processesof different companies; so as to create complex; multiparty business scenarios. In thissetting; Web applications; which were originally conceived to allow the user-to-systemdialogue; are extended with Web services; which enable system-to-system interaction; andwith process control primitives; which permit the implementation of the required businessconstraints.

Model-driven design and deployment of service-enabled web applications,Ioana Manolescu; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Significant effort is currently invested in application integration; enabling businessprocesses of different companies to interact and form complex multiparty processes. Webservice standards; based on WSDL (Web Service Definition Language); have been adoptedas process-to-process communication paradigms. However; the conceptual modeling ofapplications using Web services has not yet been addressed. Interaction with Web servicesis often specified at the level of the source code; thus; Web service interfaces are buriedwithin a programmatic specification. In this article; we argue that Web services should beconsidered first-class citizens in the specification of Web applications. Thus; service-enabledWeb applications should benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic codegeneration techniques that have long been advocated for Web application design and …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2005,141
Answering search queries with crowdsearcher,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri,Abstract Web users are increasingly relying on social interaction to complete and validatethe results of their search activities. While search systems are superior machines to getworld-wide information; the opinions collected within friends and expert/local communitiescan ultimately determine our decisions: human curiosity and creativity is often capable ofgoing much beyond the capabilities of search systems in scouting" interesting" results; orsuggesting new; unexpected search directions. Such personalized interaction occurs inmost times aside of the search systems and processes; possibly instrumented and mediatedby a social network; when such interaction is completed and users resort to the use ofsearch systems; they do it through new queries; loosely related to the previous search or tothe social interaction. In this paper we propose CrowdSearcher; a novel search paradigm …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,117
Choosing the right crowd: expert finding in social networks,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Matteo Silvestri; Giuliano Vesci,Abstract Expert selection is an important aspect of many Web applications; eg; when theyaim at matching contents; tasks or advertisement based on user profiles; possibly retrievedfrom social networks. This paper focuses on selecting experts within the population of socialnetworks; according to the information about the social activities of their users. We considerthe following problem: given an expertise need (expressed for instance as a naturallanguage query) and a set of social network members; who are the most knowledgeablepeople for addressing that need? We considers social networks both as a source ofexpertise information and as a route to reach expert users; and define models and methodsfor evaluating people's expertise by considering their profiles and by tracing their activities insocial networks. For matching queries to social resources; we use both text analysis and …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,106
Search computing,Stefano Ceri,Abstract Search Computing is a new paradigm for composing search services. While state-of-art search systems answer generic or domain-specific queries; Search Computing enablesanswering questions via a constellation of dynamically selected; cooperating searchservices; which are correlated by means of join operations. The idea is simple; yetpervasive. New language and description paradigms are required for expressing queriesand for connecting services.

Liquid query: multi-domain exploratory search on the web,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali,Abstract In this paper we propose the Liquid Query paradigm; to support users in findingresponses to multi-domain queries through exploratory information seeking acrossstructured information sources (Web documents; deep Web data; and personal datarepositories); wrapped by means of a uniform notion of search service. Liquid Query aims atfilling the gap between general-purpose search engines; which are unable to findinformation spanning multiple topics; and domain-specific search systems; which cannot gobeyond their domain limits. The Liquid Query interface consists of interaction primitives thatlet users pose questions and explore results spanning over multiple sources incrementally;thus getting closer and closer to the sought information. We demonstrate our approach witha prototype built upon the YQL (Yahoo! Query Language) framework.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,83
Exception handling in workflow-driven web applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract As the Web becomes a platform for implementing B2B applications; the need arisesof Web conceptual models for describing Web oriented workflow applications implementingbusiness processes. In this context; new problems about process correctness arise; due tothe loose control of Web applications upon the behavior of their Web clients. Indeed;incoherent user's behavior can lead to inconsistent processes. This paper presents a highlevel approach to the management of exceptions that occur during the execution ofprocesses on the Web. We present a classification of exceptions that can be raised insideworkflow-driven Web applications; and recovery policies to retrieve coherent status and dataafter an exception. We devise these concepts at high level and then we exploit them using aWeb modeling language (WebML) that in turn provides development facilities like …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,83
Specification and design of workflow-driven hypertexts,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract While the Web consolidates as the ubiquitous application delivery platform; thefeatures of Web applications evolve to cover new requirements; like the capability ofmanaging complex workflows spanning multiple users and organizations. This scenariochallenges the Web engineering methods to address a broader class of applications. Thispaper introduces workflow-driven hypertexts; defined as Web-enabled hypertextualapplications serving the workflow of multiple users; and proposes a design methodintegrating data; hypertext; and workflow modeling concepts for modeling lightweightWebenabled workflows; this approach extends the benefits of high-level conceptualmodeling and automatic code generation to a much broader class of Web applications.,Journal of Web Engineering,2002,82
Model-driven design and development of semantic Web service applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Federico Michele Facca; Irene Celino; Dario Cerizza; Emanuele Della Valle,Abstract This article proposes a model-driven methodology to design and develop semanticWeb service applications and their components; described according to the emergingWSMO standard. In particular; we show that business processes and Web engineeringmodels have sufficient expressive power to support the semiautomatic extraction of semanticdescriptions (ie; WSMO ontologies; goals; Web services; and mediators); thus partiallyhiding the complexity of dealing with semantics. Our method is based on existing models forthe specification of business processes (BPMN) combined with Web engineering models fordesigning and developing semantically rich Web applications (WebML). The proposedapproach leads from an abstract view of the business needs to a concrete implementation ofthe application by means of several design steps; high-level models are transformed into …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2007,73

Designing web applications with WebML and WebRatio,Marco Brambilla; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali; Maristella Matera,The Web Modeling Language (WebML) is a third-generation Web design methodology;conceived in 1998 in the wake of the early hypermedia models and the pioneering works onhypermedia and Web design; like HDM (Garzotto et al.; 1993) and RMM (Isakowitz et al.;1995). The original goal of WebML was to support the design and implementation of so-called dataintensive Web applications (Ceri et al.; 2002); defined as Web sites for accessingand maintaining large amounts of structured data; typically stored as records in a databasemanagement system; like online trading and ecommerce applications; institutional Web sitesof private and public organizations; digital libraries; corporate portals; and community sites.To achieve this goal; WebML reused existing conceptual data models and proposed anoriginal notation for expressing the navigation and composition features of hypertext …,*,2008,69

This paper addresses correlation and coordination issuesinvolved with asynchronous Web services; by studying different mechanisms and metadatastructures for supporting them; in addition; several interaction patterns for buildingasynchronous computations are discussed; and the trade-offs between the various patternsare shown. In conclusion; we illustrate the use of asynchronous Web services in the contextof some concrete B2B applications.,Web Services; 2004. Proceedings. IEEE International Conference on,2004,63
Reactive crowdsourcing,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri,Abstract An essential aspect for building effective crowdsourcing com-putations is the abilityof" controlling the crowd"; ie of dynamically adapting the behaviour of the crowdsourcingsystems as response to the quantity and quality of completed tasks or to the availability andreliability of performers. Most crowdsourcing systems only provide limited and predefinedcontrols; in contrast; we present an approach to crowdsourcing which provides fine-level;powerful and flexible controls. We model each crowdsourcing application as composition ofelementary task types and we progressively transform these high level specifications into thefeatures of a reactive execution environment that supports task planning; assignment andcompletion as well as performer monitoring and exclusion. Controls are specified as activerules on top of data structures which are derived from the model of the application; rules …,Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web,2013,60

Business process-based conceptual design of rich internet applications,Marco Brambilla; Juan Carlos Preciado; Marino Linaje; Fernando Sanchez-Figueroa,This paper presents a methodology and a mix of conceptual models for addressing designand development of Web applications supported by rich interfaces. For specifying the highlevel design of the user tasks; we exploit business process models. In particular; wedescribe how to model the business process; transform it into data and navigation model ofa Web application; and apply a presentation model for obtaining a Rich Internet Application(RIA). A standard business modeling language (BPMN) is used for describing workflows;which are then translated to a WebML specification of a Web application implementedaccording to the Single Page Paradigm; typical of RIAs. Finally; by integrating the RUX-Method features; refined Rich Interface design can be achieved.,Web Engineering; 2008. ICWE'08. Eighth International Conference on,2008,39

In this context; new problems about process safety and verification arise.Recent work has investigated high-level specification and verification of Web applications.This relies on a formal data-driven model of the application; which can access an underlyingdatabase as well as state information updated as the interaction progresses; and a set ofuser inputs. Properties verified concern the sequences of events; inputs; states; and actionsresulting from the interaction. For the purpose of automatic verification; properties areexpressed in linear-time or branching-time temporal logics.

Generation of WebML web application models from business process specifications,Marco Brambilla,Abstract This short paper aims at demonstrating the integration of workflow specificationswith conceptual models for Web application design. In particular; we propose a visual editorof business process diagrams (according to the BPMN notation); which seamlesslyintegrates into the commercial CASE tool called WebRatio; which allows the designer tomodel data-intensive and service-intensive Web applications based on WebML (WebModeling Language) models. A set of model transformations from BPMN workflow diagramsto WebML hypertext diagrams allows fast generation of site skeletons implementing thespecified business process. Such skeletons can be modified by the designer that is relievedfrom the time-consuming and error-prone task of specifying all the details of the workflowconstraints.,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Web engineering,2006,29

A notation for supporting social business process modeling,Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Carmen Vaca,Abstract Social networking is more and more considered as crucial for helping organizationsharness the value of informal relationships and weak ties; without compromising theconsolidated business practices embedded in conventional BPM solutions. However; noappropriate notation has been devised for specifying social aspects within business processmodels. In this paper we propose a first attempt towards the extension of business processnotations with social features. In particular; we devise an extension of the BPMN notation forcapturing social requirements. Such extension does not alter the semantics of the language:it includes a set of new event types and task types; together with some annotation for thepool/lane levels. This notation enables the description of social behaviours within BPMNdiagrams. To demonstrate the applicability of the notation; we implement it within the …,International Workshop on Business Process Modeling Notation,2011,27

Extending hypertext conceptual models with process-oriented primitives,Marco Brambilla,Abstract Web conceptual modeling is a young discipline; which is gaining popularity amongWeb developers and CASE tool vendors. However; most conceptual models for the Webproposed so far are an evolution of hypermedia models; and pay attention mostly to thespecification of data structures and navigation primitives. As the Web becomes a vehicle forimplementing B2B applications; the need arises of extending Web conceptual modelingfrom data-centric applications to data-and process-centric applications. This paper presentsa pragmatic approach to incorporate classical process modeling primitives within a Webmodeling framework and comments on the experience gained applying the resultingmethodology to an industrial case.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2003,24
Exploratory search framework for Web data sources,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Davide Mazza,Abstract Exploratory search is an information seeking behavior where users progressivelylearn about one or more topics of interest; it departs quite radically from traditional keyword-based query paradigms; as it combines querying and browsing of resources; and coversactivities such as investigating; evaluating; comparing; and synthesizing retrievedinformation. In most cases; such activities are enabled by a conceptual description ofinformation in terms of entities and their semantic relationships. Customized Webapplications; where few applicative entities and their relationships are embedded within theapplication logics; typically provide some support to exploratory search; which is; however;specific for a given domain. In this paper; we describe a general-purpose exploratory searchframework; ie; a framework which is neutral to the application logic. Our contribution …,The VLDB Journal,2013,23
A transformation framework to bridge domain specific languages to MDA,Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Massimo Tisi,Abstract The Model Driven Architecture aims at the integration of different modelinglanguages; artifacts and tools in a unified technical space. Pre-existing developmentmethodologies based on Domain Specific Languages (DSL) require a complex process tobenefit from this integration. After a MOF metamodel for the DSL is defined; there is nostandard methodology to move legacy models and tools to the new architecture. This paperproposes a general model-driven integration procedure for pre-MDA DSLs. The procedure;given the definition of suitable model transformations; is completely automatic. Theproposed framework is fully implemented; in a way independent of the specific DSL thatmust be transformed. As a case study; a toolsuite based on WebML; a DSL for designingWeb applications; is bridged to MDA.,International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2008,21
Business processes for the crowd computer,Pavel Kucherbaev; Stefano Tranquillini; Florian Daniel; Fabio Casati; Maurizio Marchese; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Social networks and crowdsourcing platforms provide powerful means to executetasks that require human intelligence instead of just machine computation power. Especiallycrowdsourcing has demonstrated its applicability in many fields; and a variety of platformshave been created for delegating small tasks to human solvers on the Web. However;creating applications that are structured; thus applications that combine more than a singletask; is a complex and typically manual endeavor that requires many different interactionswith crowdsourcing platforms. In this paper; we introduce the idea of a crowd computer;discuss its properties; and propose a programming paradigm for the development ofcrowdsourcing applications.

Therefore;development teams require appropriate tools to search and manipulate models stored inmodel repositories; eg to find and reuse models or model fragments from previous projects.Unfortunately; current approaches for model management are either ad-hoc (ie; tied tospecific types of repositories and/or models); do not support complex queries (eg; based onthe model structure and its relationship with other modelling artefacts) or do not allow themanipulation of the resulting models (eg; inspect; transform). This hinders the probability ofefficiently reusing existing models or fragments thereof. In this paper we introduce MoScript;a textual domain-specific language for model management.

We demonstrate a scenario extracted from a real-lifeapplication; the Web portal of a computer manufacturer; including interactions with third-party service providers and enabling distributors to participate in well-defined businessprocesses. The crucial advantage of our framework is the high-level modeling of a complexWeb application; extended with Web service and workflow capabilities. The application isautomatically verified for correctness and the code is automatically generated and deployed.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,20
Triplewave: Spreading RDF streams on the web,Andrea Mauri; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Daniele Dell’Aglio; Marco Balduini; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Karl Aberer,Abstract Processing data streams is increasingly gaining momentum; given the need toprocess these flows of information in real-time and at Web scale. In this context; RDF StreamProcessing (RSP) and Stream Reasoning (SR) have emerged as solutions to combinesemantic technologies with stream and event processing techniques. Research in theseareas has proposed an ecosystem of solutions to query; reason and perform real-timeprocessing over heterogeneous and distributed data streams on the Web. However; so farone basic building block has been missing: a mechanism to disseminate and exchangeRDF streams on the Web. In this work we close this gap; proposing TripleWave; a reusableand generic tool that enables the publication of RDF streams on the Web. The features ofTripleWave were selected based on requirements of real use-cases; and support a …,International Semantic Web Conference,2016,19
Pattern-based specification of crowdsourcing applications,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri; Riccardo Volonterio,Abstract In many crowd-based applications; the interaction with performers is decomposedin several tasks that; collectively; produce the desired results. Tasks interactions give rise toarbitrarily complex workflows. In this paper we propose methods and tools for designingcrowd-based workflows as interacting tasks. We describe the modelling concepts that areuseful in such framework; including typical workflow patterns; whose function is todecompose a cognitively complex task into simple interacting tasks so that the complex taskis co-operatively solved. We then discuss how workflows and patterns are managed byCrowdSearcher; a system for designing; deploying and monitoring applications on top ofcrowd-based systems; including social networks and crowdsourcing platforms. Tasksperformed by humans consist of simple operations which apply to homogeneous objects; …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2014,19

Semantic personalization of web portal contents,Christina Tziviskou; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Enriching Web applications with personalized data is of major interest for facilitatingthe user access to the published contents; and therefore; for guaranteeing successful usernavigation. We propose a conceptual model for extracting personalized recommendationsbased on user profiling; ontological domain models; and semantic reasoning. The approachoffers a high-level representation of the designed application based on a domain-specificmetamodel for Web applications called WebML.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,19
Model-driven specification of web services composition and integration with data-intensive web applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract The integration of Web services and Web applications offers challengingopportunities to academic and industrial research; the relevant issues include new methods;paradigms; and standards for supporting Web services and their composition. This paperfocuses on the specification of Web applications that compose Web services in order tosupport arbitrarily complex processes. The proposed approach extends a high-levelmodeling language; called WebML; used for the specification of the front-end of Webapplications. We develop two orthogonal extensions for the inclusion of Web services insideWeb applications; accompanied by suitable protocols for message exchange; and theempowerment of Web modeling primitives with workflow capabilities. The combined use ofthese two features gives to WebML enough expressive power for specifying complex Web …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,19

A bottom-up; knowledge-aware approach to integrating and querying web data services,Silvia Quarteroni; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri,Abstract As a wealth of data services is becoming available on the Web; building andquerying Web applications that effectively integrate their content is increasingly important.However; schema integration and ontology matching with the aim of registering dataservices often requires a knowledge-intensive; tedious; and error-prone manual process.We tackle this issue by presenting a bottom-up; semi-automatic service registration processthat refers to an external knowledge base and uses simple text processing techniques inorder to minimize and possibly avoid the contribution of domain experts in the annotation ofdata services. The first by-product of this process is a representation of the domain of dataservices as an entity-relationship diagram; whose entities are named after concepts of theexternal knowledge base matching service terminology rather than being manually …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2013,18
A framework for integrating; exploring; and searching location-based web data,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Silvia Quarteroni,This article presents the adaptation of a general search computing framework for exploratorysearch over Web data as suggested by the specificity of location-based data services. Theresult is a conceptual model of geographic entities; the spatial functions operating on them;and a special-purpose exploratory interface that lets users search combinations ofgeoreferenced objects directly on a map. Such modifications help the general frameworkprovide ranked extraction of relevant objects and their combinations; custom rankingfunctions; and cost-based access to location-based services.,IEEE Internet Computing,2011,18
Ontology-based description and discovery of business processes,Khalid Belhajjame; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Just like web services; business processes can be stored in public repositories tobe shared and used by third parties; eg; as building blocks for constructing new businessprocesses. The success of such a paradigm depends partly on the availability of effectivesearch tools to locate business processes that are relevant to the user purposes. A handfulof researchers have investigated the problem of business process discovery using as inputsyntactical and structural information that describes business processes. In this work; weexplore an additional source of information encoded in the form of annotations thatsemantically describe business processes. Specifically; we show how business processescan be semantically described using the so called abstract business processes. These aredesignated by concepts from an ontology which additionally captures their relationships …,*,2009,18
Analysing the cognitive effectiveness of the webml visual notation,David Granada; Juan Manuel Vara; Marco Brambilla; Verónica Bollati; Esperanza Marcos,Abstract WebML is a domain-specific language used to design complex data-intensive Webapplications at a conceptual level. As WebML was devised to support design tasks; the needto define a visual notation for the language was identified from the very beginning. EachWebML element is consequently associated with a separate graphical symbol which wasmainly defined with the idea of providing simple and expressive modelling artefacts ratherthan by adopting a rigorous scientific approach. As a result; the graphical models definedwith WebML may sometimes prevent proper communication from taking place between thevarious stakeholders. In fact; this is a common issue for most of the existing model-basedproposals that have emerged during the last few years under the umbrella of model-drivenengineering. In order to illustrate this issue and foster in using a scientific basis to design …,Software & Systems Modeling,2017,17
Automatic generation of workflow-extended domain models,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Sara Comai,Abstract The specification of business processes is becoming a more and more criticalaspect for organizations. Such processes are specified as workflow models expressing thelogical precedence among the different business activities (ie the units of work). Up to now;workflow models have been commonly managed through specific subsystems; calledworkflow management systems. In this paper we advocate for the integration of the workflowspecification in the system domain model. This workflow-extended domain model isautomatically derived from the initial workflow specification. Then; model-drivendevelopment methods may depart from the extended domain model to automaticallygenerate an implementation of the system enforcing the business processes in any finaltechnology platform; thus avoiding the need of basing the implementation on a dedicated …,International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2007,17
Model-driven development of social network enabled applications with WebML and social primitives,Marco Brambilla; Andrea Mauri,Abstract Social technologies are transforming the Web to a place where users activelycontribute to content production and opinion making. Social networking requirements arebecoming a core part of the needs of modern enterprises too; which need ad-hoc Webplatforms that incorporate the right set of social features for their business. This leads to theneed to provide facilities and methods for developing such socially enabled applications. Inthis paper we propose a model-driven approach that is specifically focused on thedevelopment of Web applications that exploit social features. In particular; we describe anextension of the WebML notation (a Domain Specific Language designed to model Webapplications); comprising a set of modeling concepts that encapsulate the logic of theinteraction with the social platforms. Upon this; we define a set of design patterns that …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2012,16
A metamodel transformation framework for the migration of WebML models to MDA,Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Massimo Tisi,Abstract. Traditional methodologies in Model Driven Web Engineering; like WebML; arebased on domain specific modeling languages. A Web application is usually designed usingseveral Domain Specific Models (DSM); often based on different formalisms and abstractionlevels. In this paper we propose a model-driven procedure for integrating pre-MDA DSMswithin the MDA framework. The DSMs; originally expressed in different formalisms; aretranslated into a unified representation that conforms to a MDA metamodel. The procedure;given the definition of suitable model transformations; is completely automatic. Theproposed framework is fully implemented for the WebML metamodel and can begeneralized to other Web engineering approaches.,MDWE; CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2008,15
Textual and content-based search in repositories of web application models,Bojana Bislimovska; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Model-driven engineering relies on collections of models; which are the primaryartifacts for software development. To enable knowledge sharing and reuse; models need tobe managed within repositories; where they can be retrieved upon users' queries. Thisarticle examines two different techniques for indexing and searching model repositories;with a focus on Web development projects encoded in a domain-specific language.Keyword-based and content-based search (also known as query-by-example) arecontrasted with respect to the architecture of the system; the processing of models andqueries; and the way in which metamodel knowledge can be exploited to improve search. Athorough experimental evaluation is conducted to examine what parameter configurationslead to better accuracy and to offer an insight in what queries are addressed best by each …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2014,14
Exploratory search in multi-domain information spaces with liquid query,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Salvatore Vadacca,Abstract Search Computing (SeCo) aims at building search applications that bridge the gapbetween general-purpose and vertical search engines. SeCo queries extract rankedinformation about several interconnected domains; such as" hotels";" restaurants" or"concerts"; by interacting with Web data sources which are wrapped as search services; anexample of query is:" Find a good Jazz concert close to the user's current location; togetherwith close-by good restaurants and hotels". The SeCo system supports the deployment ofsearch applications; by providing a generic software architecture and the tools for serviceand query registration; for query formulation and execution; and for result browsing. In thisdemo paper; we focus on the Liquid Query (LQ) interface which supports the iteration overquery formulation; result visualization and query refinement; with commands for perusing …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,14
Visualization of multi-domain ranked data,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Tiziana Catarci; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Maristella Matera,Abstract This chapter focuses on the visualization of multi-domain search results. We start bypositioning the problem in the recent line of evolution of search engine interfaces; whichmore and more are capable of mining semantic concepts and associations from text dataand presenting them in sophisticated ways that depend on the type of the extracted data.The approach to visualization proposed in search computing extends current practices inseveral ways: the data to visualize are N-dimensional combinations of objects; with rankingcriteria associated both to individual objects and to sets of combinations; object's propertiescan be classified in several types; for which optimized visualization families are preferred(eg; timelines for temporal data; maps for geo-located information); combinations mayexhibit any number of relevant properties to be displayed; which need to fit to the bi …,*,2011,14
Searching repositories of web application models,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Project repositories are a central asset in software development; as they preservethe technical knowledge gathered in past development activities. However; locating relevantinformation in a vast project repository is problematic; because it requires manually taggingprojects with accurate metadata; an activity which is time consuming and prone to errors andomissions. This paper investigates the use of classical Information Retrieval techniques foreasing the discovery of useful information from past projects. Differently from approachesbased on textual search over the source code of applications or on querying structuredmetadata; we propose to index and search the models of applications; which are availablein companies applying Model-Driven Engineering practices.

Constraint tuning and management for web applications,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot,Abstract Since the Web is becoming a platform for implementing complex B2C and B2Bapplications instead of simple content publishing sites; the need arises of imposingconstraints on the navigation and on the managed information. Web conceptual modelinglanguages allow to a small extent to specify constraints on the application; by means ofsome extensions to their basic primitives; however these approaches do not provide acomprehensive framework for efficient and effective constraint management. The goal of thispaper is to present a general framework to facilitate the integration of efficient integritychecking methods in Web applications. Our main contribution is the study of a set ofparameters that can be inferred from high level Web application modeling; for allowing thetuning of the constraint optimization techniques for each specific Web application.

Extracting emerging knowledge from social media,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Riccardo Volonterio; Felix Xavier Acero Salazar,Abstract Massive data integration technologies have been recently used to produce verylarge ontologies. However; knowledge in the world continuously evolves; and ontologies arelargely incomplete for what concerns low-frequency data; belonging to the so-called longtail. Socially produced content is an excellent source for discovering emerging knowledge: itis huge; and immediately reflects the relevant changes which hide emerging entities. Thus;we propose a method for discovering emerging entities by extracting them from socialcontent. Once instrumented by experts through very simple initialization; the method iscapable of finding emerging entities; we use a purely syntactic method as a baseline; andwe propose several semantics-based variants. The method uses seeds; ie prototypes ofemerging entities provided by experts; for generating candidates; then; it associates …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,13
An introduction to information retrieval,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Information retrieval is a discipline that deals with the representation; storage;organization; and access to information items. The goal of information retrieval is to obtaininformation that might be useful or relevant to the user: library card cabinets are a“traditional” information retrieval system; and; in some sense; even searching for a visitingcard in your pocket to find out a colleague's contact details might be considered as aninformation retrieval task. In this chapter we introduce information retrieval as a scientificdiscipline; providing a formal characterization centered on the notion of relevance. We touchon some of its challenges and classic applications and then dedicate a section to its mainevaluation criteria: precision and recall.,*,2013,13

Search Computing answers to queries like" Find agood Jazz concert close to a specified location; a good restaurant and a hotel at walkingdistance" and fills the gap between generic and domain-specific search engines; byproposing new methods; techniques; interfaces; and tools for building search-basedapplications spanning multiple data services. The main enabling technology is an executionengine supporting methods for rank-join execution upon ranked data sources; abstractedand wrapped by means of a unifying service model.

Asynchronous web services communication patterns in business protocols,Marco Brambilla; Giuseppe Guglielmetti; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract Asynchronous interactions are becoming more and more important in therealization of complex B2B Web applications; and Web services are at the moment the mostinnovative and well-established implementation platform for communication betweenapplications. This paper studies the existing business protocols for Web servicesinteractions; compares their expressive power; extracts a set of patterns for implementingasynchrony; studies the trade-offs and the typical usage scenarios of the various patterns;and finally proposes a sample application that has been implemented based on thesepatterns. The application has been designed using a high-level modeling language for Webapplications; thus showing that the studied patterns can be applied at a conceptual level aswell as directly at implementation level.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2005,13
Exception handling within workflow-based web applications,Marco Brambilla; Nicola D’Elia,Abstract As the Web becomes a platform for implementing B2B applications; the need arisesof extending Web conceptual modeling from data-centric applications to data-and process-centric applications. New primitives must be put in place to implement workflows describingbusiness processes. In this context; new problems about process safety arise; due to theloose control on Web clients. Indeed; user behavior can generate dangerous incoherenciesfor the execution of processes. This paper presents a proposal of workflow-enablingprimitives for Web applications; and a high level approach to the management of exceptionsthat occurs during execution of processes. We present a classification of exceptions that canoccur inside workflow-based Web applications; and recovery policies to retrieve coherentstatus and data after an exception. An implementation experience is briefly presented too.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2004,13
Model driven development approaches for mobile applications: A survey,Eric Umuhoza; Marco Brambilla,Abstract The usage and development of mobile applications (referred to as apps) areexperiencing exponential growth. Moreover; the vastness and diversity of mobile devicesand operating systems oblige the software companies; that want to reach a wide audience;to develop and deploy the same app several times; once for each targeted platforms.Furthermore; the dilemma between browser-based and native user interfaces remainsrelevant and challenges the capacity of organizations to meet the increasing demand formobile apps.

Application and simplification of BPM techniques for personal process management,Marco Brambilla,Abstract With the advent of Web 2.0 and online social interactions; people started sharingthoughts; contents and tasks online. This evolved to cover also socialization of taskmanagement; which is currently supported by a plethora of online services directed to thefinal user. However; all these tools share a common weakness: they don't provide any wayfor structuring the interactions; dependencies or constraints between tasks. This paperdiscusses a vision towards the application of BPM techniques and tools to personal taskmanagement. The challenge of this roadmap is finding the appropriate level of complexity ofprocesses: the language for modeling such processes should be complete enough fordescribing basic processes but also simple enough to let people understand; accept anduse them in their everyday life. Therefore; our proposal describes how to strip off some of …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2012,12
Tool support for model checking of web application designs,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Nathalie Moreno,Abstract In this work we report our experience in applying model checking techniques to theanalysis of static and dynamic properties of Web application models. We propose a mix oftools that facilitate model driven design of Web applications; automatic code generation; andautomatic property verification. As recommended by current tendencies in the academicfield; we bridge the gap between the tools by devising a set of MDA transformations betweenthe different models. We show that such approach is feasible although we also highlight howcurrent state-of-the-art industrial tools are still partially inadequate for providing seamlesssupport to MDA approaches for industrial Web applications.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2007,12

The relationship between anti-gay prejudice and the categorization of sexual orientation,Nicholas O Rule; Konstantin O Tskhay; Marco Brambilla; Paolo Riva; Susan A Andrzejewski; Anne C Krendl,Abstract A relatively large literature has demonstrated that sexual orientation can be judgedaccurately from a variety of minimal cues; including facial appearance. Untested in this work;however; is the influence that individual differences in prejudice against gays and lesbiansmay exert upon perceivers' judgments. Here; we report the results of a meta-analysis of 23unpublished studies testing the relationship between anti-gay bias and the categorization ofsexual orientation from faces. Aggregating data from multiple measures of bias using avariety of methods in three different countries over a period of 8 years; we found a small butsignificant negative relationship between accuracy and prejudice that was homogeneousacross the samples tested. Thus; individuals reporting higher levels of anti-gay bias appearto be less accurate judges of sexual orientation.,Personality and Individual Differences,2015,11

Semantic resource framework,Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract The Semantic Resource Framework (SRF) is a multi-level description of the datasources for search computing applications. It responds to the need of having a structuredrepresentation of search services; amenable to service exploration; selection; andinvocation. The SRF aims at extending the Service Mart model used so far in searchcomputing to overcome some of its limitations. The main new features include externalattributes; which represent the input to be provided by users for accessing objects; selectorattributes; describing the possibility to map the same access pattern to different servicesbased on some condition; key attributes for objects; and a generalized notion of nearnessbetween objects. The high-level view presented by SRF is a very simple Entity-Relationshipmodel with objects and binary connections; that can be used for very different query tasks …,*,2011,11
The next decade of BPM,Phil Gilbert,Abstract Business process management has been around for 20+ years. It can generally bedescribed as having two distinct eras so far: in the 1990's BPM was led by process expertsinside the business who transformed the focus from big-bang quality improvement initiatives(BPR-style) toward a focus on operational measurement and continuous improvement; inthe 2000's BPM shifted to an IT-led competency; centering on the role technology played inprocess understanding and improvement. In 2010; BPM is still the province of experts fromthe business and IT. What's next? Two key changes will occur by 2020. First; notions ofprocess will change from today's workflow-centric depictions to a more business-focusedview of operations; transparency and measurement. Second; as we move from middleware-dependent systems into cloud-based software; BPM participation will spread throughout …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2010,11
Model-driven engineering of service orchestrations,Marco Brambilla; Matteo Dosmi; Piero Fraternali,This paper presents a methodology for the Model Driven Engineering of complex; multi-actorbusiness processes; mixing tasks executed by humans and by machines. The idea is toenrich business description languages with a few extra details on task assignment;semantics; and typed dataflows; so as to enable a two-step generative approach: first theProcess Model is automatically transformed into an Application Model; which seamlesslyexpress both human-and machine-executable tasks; secondly; the Application Model is fedto a state-of-the-practice Web/Web Service development tool capable of producing the code.The resulting method and generative framework unify Web Service orchestration and WebUser Interface design into a coherent Model-Driven Engineering process.,Services-I; 2009 World Conference on,2009,11

Building semantic web portals with WebML,Marco Brambilla; Federico M Facca,Abstract Current conceptual models and methodologies for Web applications concentrate oncontent; navigation; and service modeling. Although some of them are meant to addresssemantic web applications too; they do not fully exploit the whole potential deriving frominteraction with ontological data sources and and from Semantic annotations. This paperproposes an extension to Web application conceptual models toward Semantic Web. Wedevise an extension of the WebML modeling framework that fulfills most of the designrequirements emerging for the new area of Semantic Web. We generalize the developmentprocess to cover Semantic Web and we devise a set of new primitives for ontology importingand querying.

Toaddress this weakness; search computing advocates a new approach in which search; join;and ranking are the central aspects for service composition.,IEEE Internet Computing,2010,9

Here weintroduce an extension of the WebML modeling framework to fulfill most of the designrequirements emerging for the new area of Semantic Web. We generalize the developmentprocess to support Semantic Web applications and we introduce a set of new primitives forontology importing and querying.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,9

On the quest for changing knowledge,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Emanuele Della Valle,Abstract For centuries; science (in German" Wissenschaft") has aimed to create (" schaffen")new knowledge (" Wissen") from the observation of physical phenomena; their modeling andempirical validation. With this vision paper; we propose to do so by observing not thephysical; but the virtual world; namely the Web with its ever growing stream of datamaterialized in the form of social network chattering; content produced on demand bycrowds of people; messages exchanged among interlinked devices in the Internet of Things;and similar. The knowledge we may find there can be dispersed; informal; contradicting andephemeral today; while already tomorrow it may be commonly accepted. The challenge iscapturing knowledge that is new; has not been formalized yet (eg; in existing knowledgebases); and is buried inside a big; moving target (the stream of online data).

Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes,Marco Brambilla; David A Butz,Abstract Two studies examined the impact of macrolevel symbolic threat on intergroupattitudes. In Study 1 (N= 71); participants exposed to a macrosymbolic threat (vs.nonsymbolic threat and neutral topic) reported less support toward social policiesconcerning gay men; an outgroup whose stereotypes implies a threat to values; but nottoward welfare recipients; a social group whose stereotypes do not imply a threat to values.Study 2 (N= 78) showed that; whereas macrolevel symbolic threat led to less favorableattitudes toward gay men; macroeconomic threat led to less favorable attitudes towardAsians; an outgroup whose stereotypes imply an economic threat. These findings arediscussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of a general climate ofthreat in shaping intergroup attitudes.,Social Psychology,2013,8

Engineering search computing applications: vision and challenges,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri,Abstract Search computing is a novel discipline whose goal is to answer complex; multi-domain queries. Such queries typically require combining in their results domain knowledgeextracted from multiple Web resources; therefore; conventional crawling and indexingtechniques; which look at individual Web pages; are not adequate for them. In this paper; wesketch the main characteristics of search computing and we highlight how various classicalcomputer science disciplines-including software engineering; Web engineering; service-oriented architectures; data management; and human-computing interaction-are challengedby the search computing approach.,Proceedings of the the 7th joint meeting of the European software engineering conference and the ACM SIGSOFT symposium on The foundations of software engineering,2009,8

MVC-Webflow: an AJAX tool for online modeling of MVC-2 web applications,Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Origgi,Modern Web applications are characterized by a high level of complexity and deal with hugeamounts of data. When the application grows in complexity; manual code development isnot suitable; because it lacks in efficiency; reuse; reliability; maintainability; and group workfacilities. On the other hand; several Web engineering approaches are too far away from theaverage developer and designer way of working to be widely adopted. In this demonstrationpaper we propose a light-weight design notation (with its companion editing tool) that leadsto the development of MVC applications. We present an on-line visual editing tool calledMVC-Webflow for the specification of simple conceptual models for MVC applications andwe provide partial automatic code generation; that can be performed on the flight directly onthe deployed application.

Fundamentals of exception handling within workflow-based Web applications,Marco Brambilla; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract As the Web becomes a platform for implementing B2B applications; the need arisesof extending Web conceptual modeling from data-centric applications to data-and process-centric applications. New primitives must be put in place to implement workflows describingbusiness processes. In this context; new problems about process safety arise; due to theloose control on Web clients. Indeed; user behavior can generate dangerous incoherenciesfor the execution of processes. This paper presents a proposal of workflow-enablingprimitives for Web applications; and a high level approach to the management of exceptionsthat occurs during execution of processes. We present a classification of exceptions that canoccur inside workflow-based Web applications; and recovery policies to retrieve coherentstatus and data after an exception. An implementation experience is briefly presented too.,Journal of Web Engineering,2005,8
Hypertext Semantics for Web Applications.,Marco Brambilla; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,Abstract. Web applications integrate dynamic pages for publishing data; functions for contentmanagement; and generic business services. To support the model-driven design andautomatic generation of Web applications; an extended notion of hypertext is required;whose semantics is scarcely investigated. In this paper; we analyse and classify thesemantic problems encountered in the computation of Web pages; characterised by multipleinterrelated pieces of content; inter-page and intra-page navigation; and content updateoperations. The identified semantic framework may help in better understanding the existingWeb conceptual models; and in reasoning at a higher level about the implementationproblems daily faced by Web developers.,SEBD,2002,8

A characterization of the layout definition problem for web search results,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Sara Comai,Abstract In the last years the user information seeking process on the Web has shifted fromdocument search to object search. Hence; the answers provided by Web search enginescannot consist any more in a mere list of pages. In this paper we consider queries returningmono-; ambiguous; or multi-domain results; where the domain represents a specific field ofinterests such as City; People; Movies; etc. and we characterize the problem for thedefinition of the layout of such results. In particular; we describe a conceptual definition ofthe Web search result layout problem; by identifying: the parameters involved in the layoutdesign; the tuning dimensions available for optimizing the result layout; and the possiblestrategies that can be adopted for producing such layouts. Finally; we provide an outlook onthe possible future research directions on this topic.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2010,7

Extending search to crowds: A model-driven approach,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri,Abstract In many settings; the human opinion provided by an expert or knowledgeable usercan be more useful than factual information retrieved by a search engine. Search systemsdo not capture the subjective opinions and recommendations of friends; or fresh; online-provided information that require contextual or domain-specific expertise. Search resultsobtained from conventional search engines can be complemented by crowdsearch; anonline interaction with crowds; selected among friends; experts; or people who are presentlyat a given location; an interplay between conventional and search-based queries can occur;so that the two search methods can support each other.

A Model-Driven Approach for Crowdsourcing Search.,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Andrea Mauri,ABSTRACT Even though search systems are very efficient in retrieving world-wideinformation; they can not capture some peculiar aspects and features of user needs; such assubjective opinions and recommendations; or information that require local or domainspecific expertise. In this kind of scenario; the human opinion provided by an expert orknowledgeable user can be more useful than any factual information retrieved by a searchengine. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach for the specification of crowd-search tasks; ie activities where real people–in real time–take part to the generalized searchprocess that involve search engines. In particular we define two models: the “Query TaskModel”; representing the metamodel of the query that is submitted to the crowd and theassociated answers; and the “User Interaction Model”; which shows how the user can …,CrowdSearch,2012,6
The anatomy of a multi-domain search infrastructure,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Current search engines do not support queries that require a complex combinationof information. Problems such as “Which theatre offers an at least-three-stars action movie inLondon close to a good Italian restaurant” can only be solved by asking multiple queries;possibly to different search engines; and then manually combining results; therebyperforming “data integration in the brain.” While searching the Web is the preferred methodfor accessing information in everyday's practice; users expect that search systems will soonbe capable of mastering complex queries. However; combining information requires adrastic change of perspective: a new generation of search computing systems is needed;capable of going beyond the capabilities of current search engines.

Business process modeling and quick prototyping with WebRatio BPM,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Butti; Piero Fraternali,Abstract. We describe a software tool called WebRatio BPM that helps close the gapbetween the modeling of business processes and the design and implementation of thesoftware applications that support their enactment. The main idea is to enhance the degreeof automation in the conversion of business process models into application models; definedas abstract; platform-independent representations of the application structure and behavior.Application models are themselves amenable to the semiautomatic transformation intoapplication code; resulting in extremely rapid prototyping and shorter time-to-market. Thanksto the proposed chain of model transformations it is also possible to fine tune the finalapplication in several ways; eg; by integrating the visual identity of the organization orconnecting the business process to legacy applications via Web Services.,BPM 2010 Demonstration Track,2010,6
Extending conceptual schemas with business process information,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Sara Comai,The specification of business processes is becoming a more and more critical aspect fororganizations. Such processes are specified as workflow models expressing the logicalprecedence among the different business activities (ie; the units of work). Typically; workflowmodels are managed through specific subsystems; called workflow management systems; toensure a consistent behavior of the applications with respect to the organization businessprocess. However; for small organizations and/or simple business processes; the complexityand capabilities of these dedicated workflow engines may be overwhelming. In this paper;we therefore; advocate for a different and lightweight approach; consisting in the integrationof the business process specification within the system conceptual schema.

Semantic search,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Semantic search seeks to answer user queries based on meanings rather thankeyword matching. For instance; when searching for “museums in Milan”; a traditionalsearch engine would answer with a list of links to Web pages that contain the keywords“museums” and “Milan”. However; a semantic search engine understands the intention ofthe user to obtain a list of museums and returns Web representations of the required real-world entities; including their semantic properties. This chapter illustrates the processadopted by semantic search engines and uses it to compare alternative semantic searchsolutions offered on the market as well as academic prototypes.,*,2013,5

Content-based search of model repositories with graph matching techniques,Bojana Bislimovska; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Modern software project repositories provide support for both source code anddesign models that describe in details the data structure; behavior; and components of anapplication. We propose a graph matching-based technique between software models toaddress content-based query (aka; query by example) on project repositories so as toretrieve significant model fragments for reuse. This can be extremely valuable in a scenariowhere the designer has a rough idea of the model or pattern he needs; he quickly sketchesa coarse schema; and wants to retrieve projects that contain matching patterns (with all thedetails in place). Our approach encompasses the transformation of models into suitablegraphs; the definition of a similarity function and an implementation within a search engineplatform.

Locating relevantinformation in a vast project repository is problematic; because it requires manually taggingprojects with accurate metadata; an activity which is time consuming and prone to errors andomissions. Just like any other artifact or web service; business processes can be stored inrepositories to be shared and used by third parties; eg; as building blocks for constructingnew business processes. The success of such a paradigm depends partly on the availabilityof effective search tools to locate business processes that are relevant to the user purposes.A handful of researchers have investigated the problem of business process discovery usingas input syntactical and structural information that describes business processes.

The success of SearchComputing; as of any technical advance; will be measured by its impact upon the searchindustry and market; and this in turn will be highly influenced by reactions of Web users anddevelopers. It is too early to anticipate such reactions–as the technology is still “underconstruction”–but this chapter attempts a first identification of the possible future players inthe development of Search Computing applications; by grossly identifying the roles of “datasource publishers” and of “application developers”; and by discussing how classicaladvertising-based models may support the new applications.

Liquid queries and liquid results in search computing,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Liquid queries are a flexible tool for information seeking; based on the progressiveexploration of the search space; they produce “fluid” results which dynamically adapt to theshape of the query; as a liquid adapts to its container. The liquid query paradigm relies onthe SeCo service mart and multi-domain query execution concepts: an expert user selects apriori the service marts relevant to the information seeking task at hand and the connectionsnecessary to join them; and publishes such a definition in the SeCo back-end. The LiquidQuery client-side interface consumes the application definition created by the expert anddynamically builds a query interface for the end-user. Such interface allows one to supplykeywords to query the pre-configured service marts and offers controls for exploring thecombinations computed by the SeCo execution engine.

The integration of these differenttechnologies raises new problems that may occur during the process execution on the Web.Exceptional situations may be caused by the improper user navigation through Web pages;by system failures that interrupt the B2B interaction; or by events semantically related to thebusiness process.

An empirical study on simplification of business process modeling languages,Eric Umuhoza; Marco Brambilla; Davide Ripamonti; Jordi Cabot,Abstract The adaptation; specially by means of a simplification process; of modelinglanguages is a common practice due to the overwhelming complexity of most standardlanguages (like UML or BPMN); not needed for typical usage scenarios while at the sametime companies don't want to go to the extremes of defining a brand new domain specificlanguage. Unfortunately; there is a lack of examples of such simplification experiences thatcan be used as a reference for future projects.

A revenue sharing mechanism for federated search and advertising,Marco Brambilla; Sofia Ceppi; Nicola Gatti; Enrico H Gerding,Abstract Federated search engines combine search results from two or more (general--purpose or domain--specific) content providers. They enable complex searches (eg;complete vacation planning) or more reliable results by allowing users to receive highquality results from a variety of sources. We propose a new revenue sharing mechanism forfederated search engines; considering different actors involved in the search resultsgeneration (ie; content providers; advertising providers; hybrid content+ advertisingproviders; and content integrators). We extend the existing sponsored search auctions bysupporting heterogeneous participants and redistribution of monetary values to the differentactors; while maintaining flexibility in the payment scheme.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,4
Trends in search interaction,Ricardo Baeza-Yates; Paolo Boldi; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Gabriella Pasi,Abstract This paper reports the main findings of a panel about trends in search engineinteraction; focused upon the use of search engines for performing complex processes. Thediscussion focuses on the different evolutionary path followed by search engines withrespect to other Web and information management solutions; making end users acquaintedwith the simplistic and never changing keyword-based query paradigm. The analysis delvesinto the pros and cons of personalization; contextualization; and exploration of Webinformation; with special attention to the presentation and user interaction aspects. In theend; we also wonder if the keyword-based query paradigm will ever change.,*,2011,4
A service-based Architecture for Multi-domain Search on the Web,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Francesco Corcoglioniti; Salvatore Vadacca,Abstract Current search engines lack in support for multi-domain queries; ie; queries thatcan be answered by combining information from two or more knowledge domains.Questions such as “Find a theater close to Times Square; NYC; showing a recent thrillermovie; close to a pizza restaurant” have no answer unless the user individually queriesdifferent vertical search engines for each domain and then manually combines results.Therefore; the need arises for a special class of search applications that combine differentsearch services. In this paper we propose an architecture aiming at answering multi-domainqueries through composition of search services and we provide facilities for the execution ofmulti-domain queries and the visualization of their results; at the purpose of simplifying theaccess to the information. We describe our service-based architecture and the …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2010,4
Modelling safe interface interactions in web applications,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Michael Grossniklaus,Abstract Current Web applications embed sophisticated user interfaces and business logic.The original interaction paradigm of the Web based on static content pages that are browsedby hyperlinks is; therefore; not valid anymore. In this paper; we advocate a paradigm shift forbrowsers and Web applications; that improves the management of user interaction andbrowsing history. Pages are replaced by States as basic navigation nodes; andBack/Forward navigation along the browsing history is replaced by a full-fledged interactiveapplication paradigm; supporting transactions at the interface level and featuringUndo/Redo capabilities. This new paradigm offers a safer and more precise interactionmodel; protecting the user from unexpected behaviours of the applications and the browser.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2009,4
Model-driven development of personalized; multichannel interfaces for audiovisual search: the PHAROS approach,Piero Fraternali; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Vincenzo Croce; Kathrine Hammervold; Eric Moore; Francesco Saverio Nucci; Michel Plu,Abstract: In this paper we illustrate the model-driven development approach applied to theuser interface of an audiovisual search application; within the European project PHAROS.We show how conceptual modelling can capture the most complex features of an audio-visual Web search portal; which allows users to pose advanced queries over multimediamaterials; access results of queries using multimodal and multi-channel interfaces; andcustomize the search experience by saving queries of interest in a personal profile; so thatthey can be exploited for asynchronous notification of new relevant audiovisual information.We show how model-driven development can help the generation of the code forsophisticated Rich Internet Application front-ends; typical of the multimedia portals of thefuture.,NEM Summit; Saint Malo; France,2009,4
Model-driven design of audiovisual indexing processes for search-based applications,Piero Fraternali; Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Bozzon,As the Web becomes a platform for multimedia content fruition; audiovisual search assumesa central role in providing users with the content most adequate to their information needs. Akey issue for enabling audiovisual search is extracting indexable knowledge from opaquemedia. Such a process is heavily constrained by scalability and performance issues andmust be able to flexibly incorporate specialized components for educing selected featuresfrom media elements. This paper shows how the use of a model-driven approach can helpdesigners specify multimedia indexing processes; verify properties of interest in suchprocesses; and generate the code that orchestrates the components; so as to enable rapidprototyping of content analysis processes in presence of evolving requirements.,Content-Based Multimedia Indexing; 2009.

In this paper we describe our approach to the second phase of SWS Challenge2006. We present the WebML design of the mediator and its implementation by the means ofthe CASE tool WebRatio; furthermore; we discuss the integration of Glue WSMO discoveryengine in our approach. The integration is achieved by invoking the Web Services exposedby Glue both for publishing and for discovering semantic services; in particular; we show thepublishing of a new shipment/purchase service and the discovery of the most convenientshipment/purchase service. Finally; we present in detail the changes we applied to thesystem in order to model the additional requirements introduced in the second phase of theChallenge.,Second Workshop of the Semantic Web Service Challenge 2006,2006,4
OntoWebML: A Knowledge Base Management System for WSML Ontologies,Christina Tziviskou; Marco Brambilla,Abstract. This paper addresses the topic of defining a knowledge base system forrepresenting ontologies according to the WSMO conceptual model. We propose a softwareengineering approach to this problem; by implementing:(i) the relational model forontologies that corresponds to the WSML representation of WSMO by means of a wellknown Web modeling language called WebML; extended by a set of new components forexploiting ontological contents in Web services and Web applications design; and (ii) a Web-based content management system for ontologies editing and reasoning; implementedusing the abovementioned software engineering approach.,2nd International Workshop on Semantic Web Enabled Software Engineering,2006,4

Model-driven development of user interfaces for IoT systems via domain-specific components and patterns,Marco Brambilla; Eric Umuhoza; Roberto Acerbis,Abstract Internet of Things technologies and applications are evolving and continuouslygaining traction in all fields and environments; including homes; cities; services; industry andcommercial enterprises. However; still many problems need to be addressed. For instance;the IoT vision is mainly focused on the technological and infrastructure aspect; and on themanagement and analysis of the huge amount of generated data; while so far thedevelopment of front-end and user interfaces for IoT has not played a relevant role inresearch. On the contrary; user interfaces can play a key role in the acceptance of IoTsolutions by final adopters. In this paper we discuss the requirements and usage scenarioscovering the front end aspects of IoT systems and we present a model-driven approach tothe design of such interfaces by: defining specific components and design patterns using …,Journal of Internet Services and Applications,2017,3
Urbanscope: A lens to observe language mix in cities,Michela Arnaboldi; Marco Brambilla; Beatrice Cassottana; Paolo Ciuccarelli; Simone Vantini,Cities of the 21st century are places where various actors interact; where physical systems;that are sometime geographically distant; are strictly dependent; where relationalmechanisms become crucial; and where the boundaries between individual and collective;local and global; real and digital become more and more blurred. In this context; socialmedia can be used as a digital lens to analyze the space and the territory of cities. In fact;they offer a great opportunity to individualize and understand the connections that mightexist between different spheres. In this article; we use Twitter to analyze the language mix ofthe city and to detect language communities within the city neighborhoods. We thencompare these “digital” communities; discovered through Twitter; with the “real” communitiesidentified by the traditional census data.

Adaptive and Interoperable Crowdsourcing,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri; Riccardo Volonterio,Crowd-based computing is an increasingly popular paradigm for building Web applications;which uses the collective strength of human actors for performing tasks that are more suitedto humans than computers. Interaction with the crowds was originally confined to specificallydesigned crowdsourcing platforms; such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. More recently; crowd-based computing has been reconsidered and extended; targeting social networks such asFacebook; Twitter; or LinkedIn; or including basic and direct interaction mechanisms; suchas routing personal emails or tweets. Crowdsearcher; the system presented here; fostersinteroperability and adaptation in crowd-based applications--for example; the ability ofsupporting multiplatform applications and adapting them in reaction to events. Thisapproach specifically supports dynamic interoperability (that is; the ability to modify the …,IEEE Internet Computing,2015,3
An explorative approach for crowdsourcing tasks design,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Andrea Mauri; Riccardo Volonterio,Abstract Crowdsourcing applications are becoming widespread; they cover very differentscenarios; including opinion mining; multimedia data annotation; localised informationgathering; marketing campaigns; expert response gathering; and so on. The quality of theoutcome of these applications depends on different design parameters and constraints; andit is very hard to judge about their combined effects without doing some experiments; on theother hand; there are no experiences or guidelines that tell how to conduct experiments; andthus these are often conducted in an ad-hoc manner; typically through adjustments of aninitial strategy that may converge to a parameter setting which is quite different from the bestpossible one. In this paper we propose a comparative; explorative approach for designingcrowdsourcing tasks. The method consists of defining a representative set of execution …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,3
IFML: Building the Front-End of Web and Mobile Applications with OMG’s Interaction Flow Modeling Language,Marco Brambilla,Abstract. Front-end design of Web applications is a complex and multidisciplinary task;where many perspectives intersect. A new standard modeling language called IFML(Interaction Flow Modeling Language) addresses this problem in a platform-independentway. IFML grants executability of models and binding to other aspects of system andenterprise design through integration with widespread software modeling languages suchas UML; BPMN; SysML; SoaML and the whole MDA suite.,Web Engineering,2015,3
Model-driven Design Frameworks for Semantic Web Applications.,Marco Brambilla; Christina Tziviskou,Data-intensive Web applications are applications whose main purpose is to give access towell-organized content; stored within relational databases; text files; or other sources. Assuch; they represented the first industrial application of the Web; and still constitute the mostimportant class Web application in terms of volumes and commercial value. Therefore; thedesign requirements for this class of applications is widely covered by Software Engineeringmethods and tools; which have been available for a long time. Among the Domain SpecificLanguages and associated methodologies specifically devised in the past for addressingthe design needs for these applications we can mention WebML [70]; OOHDM [244]; Hera[356]; and others.

Search upon UML repositories with text matching techniques,Bojana Bislimovska; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,As the quantity of software artifacts; mainly source code and software models; stored inrepositories increases; the need for their efficient search becomes more important. In thispaper we propose content-based query (aka query-by-example) approach for searchingsoftware model repositories; in order to retrieve significant models or model fragments. Thequery-by-example search conveys the user need in form of a model or pattern specified in acoarse way. Our approach incorporates analysis and indexing of models using textualinformation retrieval techniques; which exploit the knowledge of the metamodel the modelsconform to. This allows us to explore different segmentation granularities on models anddifferent indexing techniques ranging from simple bag of words; to index structures whichintegrate metamodel information.

Information exploration in search computing,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Search computing queries typically address search tasks that go beyond a singleinteraction. In this paper; we show a query paradigm that supports multi-step; exploratorysearch over multiple Web data sources. Our paradigm requires users to be aware ofsearching over “interconnected objects” with given semantics; but each exploration step issimplified as much as possible; by presenting to users at each step simple interfaces;offering some choices that can be supported by the system; choices include moving“forward”; by adding new objects to the search; or “backward”; by excluding some objectsfrom the search; and the selection and de-selection of displayed results in order todynamically manipulate the result set. For supporting exploration; we designed a newarchitectural element; called query orchestrator; which connects the user interface …,*,2011,3
Tools supporting search computing application development,Marco Brambilla; Luca Tettamanti,Abstract Search computing provides a solution to the problem of multi-domain; exploratorysearch. To manage the complex set of subsystems and configurable options; the proper setof development and configuration tools is needed. In this chapter we describe thedevelopment process phases envisioned for designing search computing applications andalso a unified tool suite that aggregates a set of design and configuration tools. The toolscover the phases of service registration; service annotation; and application configuration.The latter in turn is organized in query specification; query plan refinement; and definition ofuser interface options.,*,2011,3

The search engine industry,Tommaso Buganza; Emanuele Della Valle,Abstract In this chapter we present the main trends in the search engine industry. Being suchindustry technology based; its dynamics can be assessed by applying theories such as (a)dominant design;(b) complementary assets;(c) product and service architecture and (d)disruptive technologies. We dedicate the first section of this chapter to reviewing suchliterature and explaining how to apply it to identify trends in the search engine industrycompetition. As preliminary result we position the search engine industry among those thatare probably entering in a new fluid phase. In this industry the Google architecture alreadyemerged as dominant design; but after 2005 many new players entered the market (eg Cuil;Kosmix; Powerset; Wolfram Alpha; Bing) and most of them are not following the dominantdesign but are really trying to propose something radically new.

Better call the crowd: using crowdsourcing to shape the notation of domain-specific languages,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Javier Luis Cánovas Izquierdo; Andrea Mauri,Abstract Crowdsourcing has emerged as a novel paradigm where humans are employed toperform computational tasks. In the context of Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML)development; where the involvement of end-users is crucial to assure that the resultinglanguage satisfies their needs; crowdsourcing tasks could be defined to assist in thelanguage definition process. By relying on the crowd; it is possible to show an early versionof the language to a wider spectrum of users; thus increasing the validation scope andeventually promoting its acceptance and adoption. We propose a systematic method forcreating crowdsourcing campaigns aimed at refining the graphical notation of DSMLs. Themethod defines a set of steps to identify; create and order the questions for the crowd.

Spatial Analysis of Social Media Response to Live Events: The Case of the Milano Fashion Week,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Gianmarco Donetti,Abstract Social media response to catastrophic events; such as natural disasters or terroristattacks; has received a lot of attention. However; social media are also extremely importantin the context of planned events; such as fairs; exhibits; festivals; as they play an essentialrole in communicating them to fans; interest groups; and the general population. Thesekinds of events are geo-localized within a city or territory and are scheduled within a publiccalendar. We consider a specific scenario; the Milano Fashion Week (MFW); which is animportant event in our city. We focus our attention on the coverage of social content in space;measuring the propagation of the event in the territory. We build different clusters of fashionbrands; we characterize several features of propagation in space and we correlate them tothe popularity of involved actors. We show that the clusters along space and popularity …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion,2017,2

Being able to understand the financial market is very important for investors and;given the width and complexity of the topic; tools to support investor decisions are badlyneeded. In this paper we present Mercurio; a system that supports the decision-makingprocess of financial investors through the automatic extraction and analysis of financial datacoming from the Web. Mercurio formalizes the knowledge and reasoning of an expert infinancial journalism and uses it to identify relevant events within financial newspapers.Moreover; it performs automatic analysis of financial indexes to identify relevant eventsrelated to the stock market. Then; sequential pattern mining is used to predict exceptionalevents on the basis of the knowledge of their past occurrences and relationships with otherevents; in order to to warn investors about them.,FINREC,2016,2

Classification and Clustering,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Information overload can be addressed through machine learning techniques thatorganize and categorize large amounts of data. The two main techniques are classificationand clustering. Classification is a supervised technique that assigns a class to each dataitem by performing an initial training phase over a set of human annotated data and then asubsequent phase which applies the classification to the remaining elements. Clustering isan unsupervised technique that does not assume a priori knowledge: data are grouped intocategories on the basis of some measure of inherent similarity between instances; in such away that objects in one cluster are very similar (compactness property) and objects indifferent clusters are different (separateness property). Similarity must be calculated indifferent ways based on the data types it involves; namely categorical; numeric; textual; or …,*,2013,2

In particular; some taskssuch as quality assessment; opinion making; and sense extraction cannot be completelydelegated to automatic procedures. More and more users are increasingly relying on socialinteraction to complete and validate the results of their online activities. For instance;scouting" interesting" results; or suggesting new; unexpected search directions ininformation seeking processes occurs in most times aside of the search systems andprocesses; possibly instrumented and mediated by a social network.

Diversification for multi-domain result sets,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Marco Tagliasacchi,Abstract Multi-domain search answers to queries spanning multiple entities; like “Find ahotel in Milan close to a concert venue; a museum and a good restaurant”; by producingranked sets of entity combinations that maximize relevance; measured by a functionexpressing the user's preferences. Due to the combinatorial nature of results; good entityinstances (eg; five stars hotels) tend to appear repeatedly in top-ranked combinations. Toimprove the quality of the result set; it is important to balance relevance with diversity; whichpromotes different; yet almost equally relevant; entities in the top-k combinations.

From requirements to implementation of ad-hoc social Web applications: an empirical pattern-based approach,MARCO Brambilla,Social technologies are transforming the Web to a place where users actively contribute tocontent production and opinion making. At B2E level; enterprises look at social networkingtools as possible means for improving their operations thanks to the unstructured interactionthey foster among employees. This paper tackles the problem of defining a quick andpragmatic approach for specifying the requirements of ad-hoc social web applications andfor going down to their implementation. The approach is motivated by the fact that in mostcases the ad-hoc needs that the company foresees are just a peculiar subset of the large setof requirements that are addressed by current social platforms. The main contributions of thiswork include: the classification of the social interactions that can be observed in virtualcommunities in a comprehensive taxonomy of requirements (based on a broad analysis …,IET software,2012,2

In previous work;we have advocated a paradigm shift from static content pages that are browsed byhyperlinks to a state-based model where back and forward navigation is replaced by a full-fledged interactive application paradigm; featuring undo and redo capabilities; with supportfor exception management policies and transactional properties. In this demonstration; wepresent an editor and code generator designed to build applications based on ourapproach.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2010,2
Search computing: a model-driven perspective,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Massimo Tisi,Abstract Search Computing is a novel discipline that focuses on exploratory search of multi-domain Web queries like" Where can I attend an interesting conference in my field close to asunny beach?". The approach is based on the interaction between cooperating searchservices; using ranking and joining of results as the dominant factors for servicecomposition. This paper sketches the main characteristics of search computing anddiscusses how software engineering and model-driven engineering are challenged by thesearch computing problems. We present Search Computing applications from a model-driven perspective; in terms of (1) the models describing the objects of interest;(2) thespecification of applications through model transformations; and (3) the definition of adomain specific language (DSL) defined for the specification of search query plans.

Integration of a human face annotation technology in an audio-visual search engine platform,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Pasquale Pigazzini,Abstract Search-Based Web Applications are configurable and customizable platforms formultimedia search over the Web. This paper describes the results of the integration of anannotation component for automatic face recognition within a configurable multimedia Websearch platform. We integrate a third-party image analysis technology for human facerecognition; by extending it in order to cope with the requirements of video annotationsolutions on the Web and wrapping it according to the platform's integration specification. Asa result; the annotator outcomes are indexed within the platform and can be used for multi-modal and content-based search. We evaluate our experience in terms of developmenteffort required; indexing performances; and perceived quality of the annotation results.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,2

Design Abstractions for Innovative Web Applications: the case of the SOA augmented with Semantics,Stefano Ceri; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle,Abstract This work presents a retrospective analysis of how we have addressed newchallenges in Web technologies and applications. WebML; which was first defined about 10years ago; has been an incubator for research concerning abstractions; methods; tools; andtechnologies; acting as a glue within a group of people spread among universities;technology transfer centres; and a spin-off. In this paper; we first illustrate the commonapproach to innovation; and then show such approach at work in two contexts. One of them;dealing with “Service-Oriented Architectures”(SOA); has reached a mature state; the otherone;“Semantic Web Services”(SWS); is at its infancy; but promises to deliver very interestingresults in the forthcoming years.,European Semantic Web Conference,2007,2
Generating Extended Conceptual Schemas from Business Process Models.,Marco Brambilla; Jordi Cabot; Sara Comai,Abstract. The specification of business processes is becoming a more and more criticalaspect for organizations. Such processes are specified as workflow models expressing thelogical precedence among the different business activities (ie; the units of work). Up to now;workflow models have been commonly managed through specific subsystems; calledworkflow management systems. In this paper we advocate for an integration of the workflowspecification in the domain conceptual schema. This workflow-extended schema isautomatically derived from the workflow model and comprises some new entity andrelationship types for describing the workflow elements and a set of integrity constraints toensure the workflow precedence rules.,SEBD,2007,2
Analysis of online user behaviour for art and culture events,Behnam Rahdari; Tahereh Arabghalizi; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Nowadays people share everything on online social networks; from daily life storiesto the latest local and global news and events. Many researchers have exploited this as asource for understanding the user behaviour and profile in various settings. In this paper; weaddress the specific problem of user behavioural profiling in the context of cultural andartistic events. We propose a specific analysis pipeline that aims at examining the profile ofonline users; based on the textual content they published online. The pipeline covers thefollowing aspects: data extraction and enrichment; topic modeling; user clustering; andprediction of interest. We show our approach at work for the monitoring of participation to alarge-scale artistic installation that collected more than 1.5 million visitors in just two weeks(namely The Floating Piers; by Christo and Jeanne-Claude).

Temporal Analysis of Social Media Response to live events: the Milano Fashion Week,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel; Gianmarco Donetti,Abstract Social media response to catastrophic events; such as natural disasters or terroristattacks; has received a lot of attention. However; social media are also extremely importantin the context of planned events; such as fairs; exhibits; festivals; as they play an essentialrole in communicating them to fans; interest groups; and the general population. Thesekinds of events are geo-localized within a city or territory and are scheduled within a publiccalendar. We consider a specific scenario; the Milano Fashion Week (MFW); which is animportant event in our city. We focus our attention on the spreading of social content in time;measuring the delay of the event propagation. We build different clusters of stakeholders(fashion brands); we characterize several features of time propagation and we correlate it tothe popularity of involved actors. We show that the clusters by time and popularity are …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2017,1
A model-based method for seamless web and mobile experience,Marco Brambilla; Andrea Mauri; Mirco Franzago; Henry Muccini,Abstract Consumer-centered software applications nowadays are required to be availableboth as mobile and desktop versions. However; the app design is frequently made only forone of the two (ie; mobile first or web first) while missing an appropriate design for the other(which; in turn; simply mimics the interaction of the first one). This results into poor quality ofthe interaction on one or the other platform. Current solutions would require differentdesigns; to be realized through different design methods and tools; and that may require todouble development and maintenance costs. In order to mitigate such an issue; this paperproposes a novel approach that supports the design of both web and mobile applications atonce. Starting from a unique requirement and business specification; where web--andmobile--specific aspects are captured through tagging; we derive a platform-independent …,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Mobile Development,2016,1

Yet; suchincrease in complexity hasn't been paired by an increased awareness; among developers;of the important role that some software engineering processes play in managing suchcomplexity. In this paper we focus on the architectural design of mobile applications: weshow how this aspect is still overlooked by mobile app developers; we present a high levelprocess and several concepts that aim to guide developers in the creation of suitablearchitectures for their apps; and we describe the advantages of integrating architecturalthinking within the mobile app development process.,Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Software Development Lifecycle for Mobile,2015,1
Testing; modeling and performance evaluation of a sewage sludge fluidized bed gasifier,MATTEO BRAMBILLA,English abstract: Biomass is one of the main alternative sources of energy and its use hasbeen gaining more attention in the last decades. Sewage sludge; in particular; is producedat a fast pace by wastewater treatment plants; a good way to process it consists ingasification for syngas production. Fluidized bed gasifiers are appropriate for this purpose;as they achieve conditions comparable to perfect mixing; between biomass and gasifyingagent; thus allowing for a good heat and mass transfer. By performing experiments on alaboratory scale plant; it was possible to collect data and information to develop a model ofthe process. This study focuses on equilibrium-based modeling; which uses Gibbs freeenergy minimization to calculate the syngas composition.

Publishing Data on the Web,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract During the last 20 years a number of techniques to publish data on the Web haveemerged. They range from the inexpensive approach of setting up a Web form to query adatabase; to the costly one of publishing Linked Data. So far none of these techniques hasemerged as the preferable one; but search engine rich snippets are rapidly changing thisgame. Search engine optimization is becoming the driving business model for datapublishing.

Business process modeling languages and executionenvironments ease the definition and enactment of the business constraints; byorchestrating the activities of employees and of computer-supported services. In particular;the role of BPMN is recognized as a major leading force towards standardization in the BPMfield; enforcing all the software vendors to adhere to (or at least consider) it when shapingtheir offer. This is definitely a big advantage for the BPM practitioner; since he can rely onunified notation and semantics independently of the modeling tool of choice.

Data-driven optimization of search service composition for answering multi-domain queries,Davide Francesco Barbieri; Alessandro Bozzon; Daniele Braga; Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Campi; Stefano Ceri; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Michael Grossniklaus; Davide Martinenghi,Answering multi-domain queries requires the combination of knowledge from variousdomains. Such queries are inadequately answered by general-purpose search engines;because domain-specific systems typically exhibit sophisticated knowledge about their ownfields of expertise. Moreover; multi-domain queries typically require combining in the resultdomain knowledge possibly coming from multiple web resources; therefore conventionalcrawling and indexing techniques; based on individual pages; are not adequate. In thispaper we present a conceptual framework for addressing the composition of search servicesfor solving multi-domain queries. The approach consists in building an infrastructure forsearch service composition that leaves within each search system the responsibility ofmaintaining and improving its domain knowledge; and whose main challenge is to …,VLDB Workshop on Using Search Engine Technology for Information Management (USETIM),2009,1

Dissecting Design Effort and Drawing Effort in UML Modeling,Rodi Jolak; Eric Umuhoza; Truong Ho-Quang; Michel RV Chaudron; Marco Brambilla,One argument in the discussion about the adoption of UML in industry is the supposedlylarge effort it takes to do modeling. Our study explores how the creation of UML models canbe understood to consist of different cognitive activities:(i) designing: thinking about thedesign (ideation; key-design decision making);(ii) notation expression: expressing a designin a modeling notation and (iii) layouting: the spatial organization of model elements in adiagram. We explain that these different subactivities relate to different short-term and long-term benefits of modeling. In this study we present two controlled experiments with a total of100 subjects creating models for a small system. In these experiments we focus on softwaremodels as represented through UML class diagram. Our results show that at least 56% ofthe effort spent on creating a class model is actually due to designing.

Harvesting Knowledge from Social Networks: Extracting Typed Relationships Among Entities,Andrea Caielli; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Florian Daniel,Abstract Knowledge bases like DBpedia; Yago or Google's Knowledge Graph contain hugeamounts of ontological knowledge harvested from (semi-) structured; curated data sources;such as relational databases or XML and HTML documents. Yet; the Web is full ofknowledge that is not curated and/or structured and; hence; not easily indexed; for examplesocial data. Most work so far in this context has been dedicated to the extraction of entities;ie; people; things or concepts. This paper describes our work toward the extraction ofrelationships among entities. The objective is reconstructing a typed graph of entities andrelationships to represent the knowledge contained in social data; without the need for a-priori domain knowledge.

Cognifying Model-Driven Software Engineering,Jordi Cabot; Robert Clarisó; Marco Brambilla; Sébastien Gerard,Abstract The limited adoption of Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is due to avariety of social and technical factors; which can be summarized in one: its (real orperceived) benefits do not outweigh its costs. In this vision paper we argue that thecognification of MDSE has the potential to reverse this situation. Cognification is theapplication of knowledge (inferred from large volumes of information; artificial intelligence orcollective intelligence) to boost the performance and impact of a process.

Modeling and Analyzing Engagement in Social Network Challenges,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Chiara Leonardi; Andrea Mauri; Riccardo Volonterio,Abstract Participation to challenges within social networks is a very effective instrument forpromoting a brand or event. In this paper; we take the challenge organizer's perspective;and we study how to raise the engagement of players in challenges where the players arestimulated to create and evaluate content; thereby indirectly raising the awareness about thebrand or event itself. We illustrate a comprehensive model of the actions and strategies thatcan be exploited for progressively boosting the social engagement during the challengeevolution. The model studies the organizer-driven management of interactions amongplayers; and evaluates the effectiveness of each action in light of several other factors (time;repetition; third party actions; interplay between different social networks; and so on). Weevaluate the model through a set of experiment upon a real case; the YourExpo2015 …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2016,*
How Twitter reveals Cities within Cities,Michela Arnaboldi; Marco Brambilla; Beatrice Cassottana; Paolo Ciuccarelli; Simone Vantini,Abstract Cities are expanding and becoming more and more dynamic in terms of movementof population and; as a consequence; they are becoming melting pots with people ofdifferent cultures; religions and languages. In this paper; the authors use the multilingualanalysis of Twitter to discover the" hidden cities" concealed within the city of Milan. Using thesocial media Twitter as a data source helps to detect weaker signals that are not capturedthrough traditional census data. In this study; neighbourhoods in Milan are identified asareas where people speak mainly the same language on Twitter and these results are thencompared with census data; to underline any parallelisms or discrepancies between the twosources of data. An added value of the paper is that the results are implemented within anonline city dashboard; called Urbanscope.,Proceedings of the 7th 2016 International Conference on Social Media & Society,2016,*

Assessing Online Media Content Trustworthiness; Relevance and Influence: an Introductory Survey.,Eleonora Ciceri; Roman Fedorov; Eric Umuhoza; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali,Abstract. The increasing popularity of social media articles and microblogging systems ischanging the way online information is produced: users are both content publishers andcontent consumers. Since information is produced and shared by common users; whousually have a limited domain knowledge; and due to an exponential growth of the availableinformation; assessing online content trustworthiness is vital. Several works in the state ofthe art approach this issue and propose different models to estimate online contenttrustworthiness; content relevance and user influence. In this paper we investigate the mostrelevant research works in this domain; highlighting their common characteristics andpeculiarities in terms of content source type; trust-related content features; trust evaluationmethods and performance assessment techniques.,KDWeb,2015,*

Link Analysis,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Ranking is perhaps the most important feature of a search engine; as it allows theuser to efficiently order the huge amount of pages matching a query according to theirrelevance to the user's information need. With respect to traditional textual search engines;Web information retrieval systems build ranking by combining at least two evidences ofrelevance: the degree of matching of a page—the content score—and the degree ofimportance of a page—the popularity score. While the content score can be calculated usingone of the information retrieval models described in Chap. 3; the popularity score can becalculated from an analysis of the indexed pages' hyperlink structure using one or more linkanalysis models. In this chapter we introduce the two most famous link analysis models;PageRank and HITS.,*,2013,*
Search Process and Interfaces,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Traditional information retrieval is based on a simple paradigm: driven by aninformation need; users seek information by composing a query; using a search system; thesystem; in turn; associates relevant documents to the query and returns them to the users.However; search is more a means than an end; and the needs behind an informationseeking process are typically diverse and articulated. Thus; interaction with search systemstypically involves several steps of refinement and exploration. Visual interfaces are designedto effectively support this iterative process; help users to understand and express theirinformation needs; and collect the results when the process ends. This chapter providesinsight into the main theoretical models used to describe the information seeking process;and offers an overview of the user interface components used by modern search engines.,*,2013,*
Recommendation and Diversification for the Web,Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Piero Fraternali; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract Web search effectiveness is hampered by several factors; including the existence ofseveral similar resources; ambiguous queries posed by users; and the varied profiles andobjectives of users who submit the same query. This chapter focuses on recommendationand diversification techniques as possible solutions to these issues. Recommendationsystems aim at predicting the level of preferences of users towards some items; with thepurpose of suggesting ones they may like; among a set of elements they haven't consideredyet. Diversification is a technique that aims at removing redundancy in search results; withthe purpose of reducing the information overload and providing more satisfying and diverseinformation items to the user. Both techniques; although typically “hidden behind thecurtains” to the end user; result in dramatically enhancing user satisfaction with the …,*,2013,*

Since 2009; thousands of tables have beenshared online; encompassing data from virtually any domain and entered by all kinds ofusers; from professional to non-experts. While Fusion Tables are a potentially precioussource of freely available structured information for all sorts of applications; complexquerying and composing them is not supported natively; as it requires understanding boththe structure and content of tables' data; which are heterogeneous and produced" bottom-up".

In this paper we propose an approach and a concrete architecturefor optimizing exploratory search tasks on mobile devices. Our claim is that new searchparadigms may let users conduct the search on small devices without being hampered bythe limitations of the devices themselves. Even better; appropriate solutions may also exploitthe advantages of such devices for further improving the overall search experience.,*,2012,*
An Incentive–Compatible Revenue–Sharing Mechanism for the Economic Sustainability of Multi–domain Search Based on Advertising,Marco Brambilla; Sofia Ceppi; Nicola Gatti; Enrico H Gerding,Abstract Multi–domain search engines decompose complex queries addressing severalissues at a time into sub–queries; and forwards them to one or more domain–specificcontent providers; typically implemented as Web services. This enables complex searches(eg; vacation planning; composed of a hotel; flight; and car search); and allows users toreceive aggregated and high quality results from a variety of sources. We focus on thedesign of a revenue sharing mechanism for multi–domain search; considering the generalsetting in which different actors (content providers; advertising providers; hybrid content+advertising providers; and content integrators) are involved in the search results generation.The design of such a mechanism is paramount for the economic sustainability of multi–domain search.

Query splitting techniques and search service recommendation for multi-domain natural language queries,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Current general purpose search engines are not able to address multi-domainqueries; ie; queries that span over several domains of interest. In this paper we address thegeneral problem of natural language multi-domain search queries; seen as the first step ofthe information exploration process. We propose an approach that splits the queries intodomain-specific subqueries; and suggests a vertical search engine API to be invoked. Theuser may be asked for the missing details needed to invoke the API and a first resultset canbe retrieved (and then explored).,Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Web APIs and Service Mashups,2011,*

Build your complex search: social; behavioral; and micro-economic perspective on modern Web search,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Alessandro Bozzon,ABSTRACT So far; Web search has been a playground for few giants. However; whiletraditional search engines are superb in their ability of extracting the Web pages that mostclosely match with user's keywords; they fail in going beyond such simple paradigm. On theother side; an increasing number of data sets is becoming available on the Web as (semi)structured data instead of userconsumable pages. Web search has huge potentials forimprovement thanks to the high quality of these data sources; but this can be achieved onlyby designing new search applications that federate those sources.

Search Computing: Addressing Complex Search on the Web,Stefano Ceri; Marco Brambilla,Abstract Web search is considered a playground for a few giants—such as Google; Yahoo!and Bing—that relegate the other players to market niches. However; Web search is far fromsatisfying all information needs; because many search queries are complex; requireinformation integration; and go beyond what can be offered by a single Web page; on thesequeries; generalized search engines do not perform well enough.

Knowledge creation on the digital era? How to deal with typical biases on social media data.,Melisa L Diaz Lema; Michela Arnaboldi; Marco Brambilla,The digital era is heavily transforming the considerations around the knowledge creation.Not a few reflexions have been made around the way data-driven approaches arepermeating and changing traditional paradigms. Some radical thinkers provocatively assure;that 'the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete'given how new data analyticstechniques are able to gain insights from complex phenomenon; allowing an empiricistmode of knowledge production [1]. Nonetheless; a most moderate perspective challengesthis ultimate capacity; stablishing that is required; in each particular field of study; to put atthe centre the frame of an expert; since data can only represent information for an agent thatis already knowledgeable [2]. This last frame does not look to persuade the vindication of thetraditional scientific method; but to acknowledge the fact that 'big data'; despite its …,*,*,*
Share this,Marco Brambilla,Over one billion cars interact with each other on the road every day. Each driver has his owndriving style; which could impact safety; fuel economy and road congestion. Knowledgeabout the driving style of the driver could be used to encourage “better” driving behaviourthrough immediate feedback while driving; or by scaling auto insurance rates based on theaggressiveness of the driving style.In this work we report on our study of driving behaviourprofiling based on unsupervised data mining methods. The main goal is to detect thedifferent driving behaviours; and thus to cluster drivers with similar behaviour. This paves theway to new business models related to the driving sector; such as Pay-How-You-Driveinsurance policies and car rentals. Here is the presentation I gave on this topic:,*,*,*
Enhancing Flexibility in User Interaction Modeling by Adding Design Uncertainty to IFML,Marco Brambilla; Romina Eramo; Alfonso Pierantonio; Gianni Rosa; Eric Umuhoza,Abstract—User interaction (UI) design is an important task in the development of softwareapplications: in fact the success of the application itself; as well as the business behind it; isstrongly related to the user experience. Unfortunately; designers can obtain realisticfeedback from users about their actual expectations only at runtime; by analyzing the userbehavior over the final application. A possible solution to this problem is to integrate the userfeedback in the design phase; for example through A/B split testing; which allows to test theeffectiveness of different variants of the application interface. However; so far A/B testing hasbeen addressed only through manual coding and a-posteriori refactoring based on theanalysis of the results. Model-driven development may enable the integration of suchtechniques with runtime log analysis and design-time application specifications …,*,*,*
Myths and Challenges in Knowledge Extraction and Big Data Analysis on Human-Generated Content from Web and Social Media Sources,Marco Brambilla,Abstract. Whatever people produce on digital media can be a relevant source of knowledgeand behavioural analysis. This is the subject of interest of a wide part of the new disciplineknown as Web Science. However; special care must be exercised when setting up studieson this kind of sources. Indeed; these studies rarely satisfy the established scientific methodguidelines; because of the nature and size of the data; as well as because of the bias andscarce generalizability of results. This paper identifies some of the most crucial challengesthat need to be addressed when tackling knowledge extraction and data analysis out ofobservational studies on human-generated content.,*,*,*
Analysis and Knowledge Extraction from Event-related Visual Content on Instagram,Tahereh Arabghalizi; Behnam Rahdari; Marco Brambilla,Abstract. Nowadays people share everything on online social networks; from daily lifestories to the latest local and global news and events. Many researchers have exploited thisas a source for understanding the user behaviour and profile in various settings. In thispaper; we propose two quantitative methods that investigate the relevance of the publishedphotos about a cultural event in terms of knowledge that can be extracted; user behaviourand relation to the context of the event. We show our approach at work for the monitoring ofparticipation to a large-scale artistic installation that collected more than 1.5 million visitors injust two weeks (namely The Floating Piers; by Christo and Jeanne-Claude).

Light-induced fluorescence spectroscopy of adenomas; adenocarcinomas and non-neoplastic mucosa in human,Renato Marchesini; Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Pignoli,Abstract In an attempt to evaluate whether induced fluorescence could be exploited todiscriminate neoplastic from non-neoplastic tissue; fluorescence spectroscopy wasperformed at 450–800 nm on 83 biopsy specimens of colonic mucosa. Measurementsshowed that fluorescence spectra of adenoma; adenocarcinoma and non-neoplasticmucosa manifest dissimilar patterns. Nine variables; whose photophysical and/or biologicalbases need further investigation; were derived from the spectra. Discriminant functionsbetween the groups of lesions were determined by using a stepwise discriminant analysis.The diagnostic test had a sensitivity of 80.6% and 88.2%; and a specificity of 90.5% and95.2% in discriminating neoplastic from non-neoplastic mucosa and adenoma from non-neoplastic mucosa respectively.

Instrumenting Continuous Knowledge Extraction; Sharing; and Benchmarking,Marco Brambilla; Emanuele Della Valle; Andrea Mauri; Riccardo Tommasini,Science aims at creating new knowledge upon the existing one; from the observation ofphysical phenomena; their modeling and empirical validation. This combines the well knownmotto “standing on the shoulders of giants”(attributed to Bernard of Chartres andsubsequently rephrased by Isaac Newton) with the need of trying and validating newexperiments.However; knowledge in the world continuously evolves; at a pace that cannotbe traced even by large crowdsourced bodies of knowledge such as Wikipedia. A largeshare of generated data are not currently analysed and consolidated into exploitableinformation and knowledge (Ackoff 1989). In particular; the process of ontologicalknowledge discovery tends to focus on the most popular items; those which are mostlyquoted or referenced; and is less effective in discovering less popular items; belonging to …,*,*,*

A Model-Driven Approach for Crowdsourcing Search,Marco Brambilla; Alessandro Bozzon; Andrea Mauri,ABSTRACT Even though search systems are very efficient in retrieving world-wideinformation; they can not capture some peculiar aspects and features of user needs; such assubjective opinions and recommendations; or information that require local or domainspecific expertise. In this kind of scenario; the human opinion provided by an expert orknowledgeable user can be more useful than any factual information retrieved by a searchengine. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach for the specification of crowd-search tasks; ie activities where real people–in real time–take part to the generalized searchprocess that involve search engines. In particular we define two models: the “Query TaskModel”; representing the metamodel of the query that is submitted to the crowd and theassociated answers; and the “User Interaction Model”; which shows how the user can …,*,*,*
A Framework for the Integration; Exploration and Search of Location-Based Data Services,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Silvia Quarteroni,Abstract. The widespread availability of smart phones and other locationaware; Web-enabled mobile devices paves the way to a huge set of applications that exploit userposition and geo-tagged information. Users expect their devices to provide richer usageexperience by integrating their local context with a wide range of general data sourcesavailable on the Web; therefore; applications must be able to support not only geo-localization; but also the integration of such contexts with information needs about genericdata resources. In this paper; we present the adaptation of a general search computingframework as suggested by the specificity of location-based data services; this affectsseveral layers of the framework; resulting in a conceptual model of geographic entities; theintegrated provisioning of spatial functions operating upon them; and finally a special …,*,*,*

Search systemsdo not capture the subjective opinions and recommendations of friends; or fresh; online-provided information that require contextual or domain-specific expertise. In this paper wepropose an approach where search is complemented by online help by “special” crowds;selected among friends; experts; or people who are presently at a given location. We showhow a conventional search can interplay with a search of crowd opinions; so that the twosearch methods can support each other.

Furthermore; models are becoming more and more importantas a communication tool across disciplines and enterprise roles. In particular understandabilityand readability of models is a key success factor for comprehensive modeling of enterprise practicesand IT systems. This entails the possibility of modeling different perspectives of theenterprise; and yet grant coherency and integration between the models … The CPSM 2013workshop was held as a multi-disciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners actively workingon quality; usability and maintainability of soft- ware and process models. The goal of the CPSMworkshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners in the area of Business Process(re)design and software maintenance; to discuss about and exchange ideas on quality …,*,*,*

Community Management Systems for Social Deliberation and Action,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Andrea Mauri; Stefano Butti; Matteo Silva,ABSTRACT In this paper we discuss the use of social media as a platform for constructingCommunity Management Systems; defined as tools for identifying; profiling and working withcommunities of interest; for both large scale deliberation and action. We motivate the notionof Community Management System; present its architecture; discuss application scenarios;identify some of the research problems at the base of its foundation; survey relevant resultsfrom the research community; and highlight the building blocks that we are constructing toimplement and put to work a such system.,*,*,*
Model-Driven Design and Deployment of Service-Enabled Web Applications loana Manolescu1 lNRlA Futurs-LRl; France,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,Significant effort is currently invested in application integration; enabling business processesof different companies to interact and form complex multi-party processes. Web servicestandards; based on WSDL; have been adopted as process-to-process communicationparadigms. However; the conceptual modeling of applications using Web services has notyet been addressed. Interaction with Web services is often specified at the level of thesource code; thus; Web service interfaces are buried within a programmatic specification. Inthis paper; we argue that Web services should be considered as first-class citizens in thespecification of Web applications. Thus; service-enabled Web applications should benefitfrom the high-level modeling and automatic code generation techniques that have longbeen advocated for Web application design and implementation. To this end; we extend a …,*,*,*
SERVICE DISCOVERY WITH SWE-ET AND DIANE,Ulrich Küster; Andrea Turati; Maciej Zaremba; B König-Ries; D Cerizza; E Della Valle; M Brambilla; S Ceri; FM Facca; C Tziviskou,Abstract: Semantic service discovery and matchmaking has received increased attentionwithin the last years. Various approaches have been proposed but agreed upon criteria orcommon use and test cases to objectively evaluate such approaches are widely lacking. Inthis paper we present an in-depth comparison of the solutions to the discovery problemsdefined by the SWS-Challenge 2006. By means of this common and independentlydeveloped scenario we can develop a much better understanding for the appliedtechnologies in general; but also and in particular for the trade-offs involved in the differentapproaches.,*,*,*

A Tool for Model A Tool for Model-driven Design driven Design driven Design of Rich Internet Applications Internet Applications based on AJAX based on AJAX bas...,Marco Brambilla; Piero Fraternali; Emanuele Molteni,ABSTRACT This Chapter describes how the design tool WebRatio (and its companionconceptual model WebML) have been extended to support the new requirements imposedby Rich Internet Applications (RIAs); that are recognized to be one of the main innovationsthat lead to the Web 2.0 revolution. Complex interactions such as drag and drop; dynamicresizing of visual components; graphical editing of objects; partial page refresh areaddressed by the RIA extensions of WebRatio. The chapter discusses what kinds ofmodelling primitives are required for specifying such patterns and how these primitives canbe integrated in a CASE tool. Finally; a real industrial case is presented in which the novelRIA features are successfully applied.,*,*,*
A Framework for Exception Handling in Web-based Applications,Marco Brambilla; Sara Comai; Christina Tziviskou,Abstract. In the context of B2B and intranet applications; the development paradigm ismoving towards more complex applications; typically based on workflow specifications forimplementing business processes. Since applications are becoming more and morebusiness-critical; the problem of granting safety and robustness arises. In the Web context;this issue is particularly critical and not investigated in its peculiar aspects; such as loosecontrol of Web applications upon the behavior of their Web clients; typically leading toincoherent user's behavior. This paper presents a high level approach to the management ofexceptions that occur during the execution of processes on the Web. We present aclassification of exceptions that can be raised inside workflowdriven Web applications; and aset of three models for managing exceptions: capturing model; notifying model; and …,*,*,*
