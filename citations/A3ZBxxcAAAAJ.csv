A music recommendation system based on music data grouping and user interests,Hung-Chen Chen; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract With the growth of the World Wide Web; a large amount of music data is availableon the Internet. In addition to searching expected music objects for users; it becomesnecessary to develop a recommendation service. In this paper; we design the MusicRecommendation System (MRS) to provide a personalized service of musicrecommendation. The music objects of MIDI format are first analyzed. For each polyphonicmusic object; the representative track is first determined; and then six features are extractedfrom this track. According to the features; the music objects are properly grouped. For users;the access histories are analyzed to derive user interests. The content-based; collaborativeand statistics-based recommendation methods are proposed; which are based on thefavorite degrees of the users to the music groups.

Mining frequent itemsets from data streams with a time-sensitive sliding window,Chih-Hsiang Lin; Ding-Ying Chiu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Mining frequent itemsets has been widely studied over the last decade. Pastresearch focuses on mining frequent itemsets from static databases. In many of the newapplications; data flow through the Internet or sensor networks. It is challenging to extend themining techniques to such a dynamic environment. The main challenges include a quickresponse to the continuous request; a compact summary of the data stream; and amechanism that adapts to the limited resources. In this paper; we develop a novel approachfor mining frequent itemsets from data streams based on a time-sensitive sliding windowmodel. Our approach consists of a storage structure that captures all possible frequentitemsets and a table providing approximate counts of the expired data items; whose size canbe adjusted by the available storage space. Experiment results show that in our approach …,*,2005,171
Hiding sensitive association rules with limited side effects,Yi-Hung Wu; Chia-Ming Chiang; Arbee LP Chen,Data mining techniques have been widely used in various applications. However; themisuse of these techniques may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Researchershave recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. Nevertheless; undesiredside effects; eg; nonsensitive rules falsely hidden and spurious rules falsely generated; maybe produced in the rule hiding process. In this paper; we present a novel approach thatstrategically modifies a few transactions in the transaction database to decrease thesupports or confidences of sensitive rules without producing the side effects. Since thecorrelation among rules can make it impossible to achieve this goal; in this paper; wepropose heuristic methods for increasing the number of hidden sensitive rules and reducingthe number of modified entries.

Discovering nontrivial repeating patterns in music data,Jia-Lien Hsu; Chih-Chin Liu; Arbee LP Chen,A repeating pattern in music data is defined as a sequence of notes which appears morethan once in a music object. The themes are a typical kind of repeating patterns. The themesand other nontrivial repeating patterns are important music features which can be used forboth content-based retrieval of music data and music data analysis. In this paper; wepropose two approaches for fast discovering nontrivial repeating patterns in music objects.In the first approach; we develop a data structure called correlative matrix and its associatedalgorithms for extracting the repeating patterns. In the second approach; we introduce astring-join operation and a data structure called RP-tree for the same purpose. Experimentsare performed to compare these two approaches with others. The results are furtheranalyzed to show the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approaches.,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2001,151
A graph-based approach for discovering various types of association rules,Show-Jane Yen; Arbee L. P.  Chen,Mining association rules is an important task for knowledge discovery. We can analyze pasttransaction data to discover customer behaviors such that the quality of business decisionscan be improved. Various types of association rules may exist in a large database ofcustomer transactions. The strategy of mining association rules focuses on discovering largeitem sets; which are groups of items which appear together in a sufficient number oftransactions. We propose a graph-based approach to generate various types of associationrules from a large database of customer transactions. This approach scans the databaseonce to construct an association graph and then traverses the graph to generate all largeitem sets. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithms outperform other algorithms whichneed to make multiple passes over the database.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and data Engineering,2001,128
An efficient approach to discovering knowledge from large databases,Show-Jane Yen; Arbee LP Chen,We study two problems: mining association rules and mining sequential patterns in a largedatabase of customer transactions. The problem of mining association rules focuses ondiscovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear togetherin a sufficient number of transactions; while the problem of mining sequential patternsfocuses on discovering large sequences where a large sequence is an ordered list of sets ofitems which appear in a sufficient number of transactions. We present efficient graph basedalgorithms to solve these problems. The algorithms construct an association graph toindicate the associations between items and then traverse the graph to generate largeitemsets and large sequences; respectively. Our algorithms need to scan the database onlyonce.

Enabling personalized recommendation on the web based on user interests and behaviors,Yi-Hung Wu; Yong-Chuan Chen; Arbee LP Chen,The dramatic growth of the Web has brought about the rapid accumulation of data and theincreasing possibility of information sharing. As the population on the Web grows; theanalysis of user interests and behaviors will provide hints on how to improve the quality ofservice. We define user interests and behaviors based on the documents read by the user. Amethod for mining such user interests and behaviors is then presented. In this way; eachuser is associated with a set of interests and behaviors; which is stored in the user profile. Inaddition; we define six types of user profiles and a distance measure to classify users intoclusters. Finally; three kinds of recommendation services using the clustered results arerealized. For performance evaluation; we implement these services on the Web to makeexperiments on real data/users.

Optimal index and data allocation in multiple broadcast channels,Shou-Chih Lo; Arbee LP Chen,The issue of data broadcast has received much attention in mobile computing. A periodicbroadcast of frequently requested data can reduce the workload of the up-link channel andfacilitate data access for the mobile user. Since the mobile units usually have limited batterycapacity; the minimization of the access latency for the broadcast data is an importantproblem. The indexing and scheduling techniques on the broadcast data should beconsidered. We propose a solution to find the optimal index and data allocation; whichminimizes the access latency for any number of broadcast channels. We represent all thepossible allocations as a tree in which the optimal one is searched; and propose a pruningstrategy based on some properties to greatly reduce the search space. Experiments areperformed to show the effectiveness of the pruning strategy. Moreover; we propose two …,Data Engineering; 2000. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2000,113
Efficient repeating pattern finding in music databases,Jia-Lien Hsu; Arbee LP Chen; C-C Liu,ABSTRACT In this paper; we propose an approach for the extraction of the repeatingpatterns in music objects.

Query by rhythm: An approach for song retrieval in music databases,James CC Chen; Arbee LP Chen,We propose techniques for retrieving songs by rhythm from music databases. The rhythm ofsongs is modeled by rhythm strings. The song retrieval problem is then transformed to thestring matching problem. In order to allow approximate string matching; we define similaritymeasures on rhythm strings. An index structure; called L-tree; is proposed to support efficientsub-string matching. Retrieval algorithms based on L-tree are then designed to provideapproximate and sub-song retrieval. Experimental results show that this approach iseffective and efficient.,Research Issues In Data Engineering; 1998.'Continuous-Media Databases and Applications'.

Efficient theme and non-trivial repeating pattern discovering in music databases,Chih-Chin Liu; Jia-Lien Hsu; Arbee LP Chen,Proposes an approach for the fast discovery of all non-trivial repeating patterns in musicobjects. A repeating pattern is a sequence of notes which appears more than once in amusic object. The longest repeating patterns in music objects are typically their themes. Thethemes and other non-trivial repeating patterns are important musical features which can beused both for content-based retrieval of music data and for music data analysis. We presenta data structure called an RP-tree (repeating pattern tree) and its associated algorithms forthe fast extraction of all non-trivial repeating patterns in a music object. Experiments areperformed to compare this method with related approaches. The results are further analysedto show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.,Data Engineering; 1999.

Evaluating aggregate operations over imprecise data,Arbee LP Chen; Jui-Shang Chiu; Frank Shou-Cheng  Tseng,Imprecise data in databases were originally denoted as null values; which represent themeaning of" values unknown at present." More generally; a partial value corresponds to afinite set of possible values for an attribute in which exactly one of the values is the" true"value. We define a set of extended aggregate operations; namely sum; average; count;maximum; and minimum; which can be applied to an attribute containing partial values. Twotypes of aggregate operators are considered: scalar aggregates and aggregate functions.We study the properties of the aggregate operations and develop efficient algorithms forcount; maximum and minimum. However; for sum and average; we point out that in generalit takes exponential time complexity to do the computations.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,90
Answering heterogeneous database queries with degrees of uncertainty,Frank SC Tseng; Arbee LP Chen; Wei-Pang Yang,Abstract In heterogeneous database systems; partial values have been used to resolvesome schema integration problems. Performing operations on partial values may producemaybe tuples in the query result which cannot be compared. Thus; users have no way todistinguish which maybe tuple is the most possible answer. In this paper; the concept ofpartial values is generalized to probabilistic partial values. We propose an approach toresolve the schema integration problems using probabilistic partial values and develop a fullset of extended relational operators for manipulating relations containing probabilistic partialvalues. With this approach; the uncertain answer tuples of a query are associated withdegrees of uncertainty (represented by probabilities). That provides users a comparisonamong maybe tuples and a better understanding on the query results. Besides; extended …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1993,88
Optimizing chain queries in a distributed database system,Dah-Ming Chiu; Philip A Bernstein; Yu-Chi Ho,This paper studies the problem of query optimization in a distributed database. Assuming alinear additive cost function (in volume of data moved); we present a fast algorithm forfinding the optimal program that answers a class of common queries; called chain queries.The key to the problem formulation and to the derivation of an efficient algorithm is anelegant parameterization of the database state against which the query is to be answered.This parameterization then enables us to characterize the set of potentially optimalprograms; which in turn leads to a fast dynamic programming algorithm. Since in practice theneeded parameters may not be available to the database system; we also discuss how todeal with partial parameterizations of the database state.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1984,88
Outerjoin optimization in multidatabase systems,Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Outerjoin is used in distributed relational multidatabase systems for integrating localschemas to a global schema. Queries against the global schema need to be modified;optimized; and decomposed into subqueries at local sites for processing. Since outerjoincombines local relations in different databases to form a global relation; it is expensive toprocess. In this paper; based on the structure of the query and the definition of the schemas;queries with outerjoin; join; select and project operations are optimized. Conditions whereouterjoin can be avoided or be transformed into a one-side outerjoin are identified. Byconsidering these conditions the response time for query processing can be reduced.,Proceedings of the second international symposium on Databases in parallel and distributed systems,1990,84

A music segmentconsists of a segment type and the associated beat and pitch information. The similaritymeasures for the beat and pitch are defined. Two index structures for music segments areproposed; in which the minimal and maximal values of the beat and pitch of the musicsegments are stored to aid the song retrieval process.

An approximate string matching algorithm for content-based music data retrieval,Chih-Chin Liu; Jia-Lien Hsu; Arbee LP Chen,An approach for content based music data retrieval is proposed. In this approach; thematicfeature strings; such as melody strings; rhythm strings; and chord strings are extracted fromthe original music objects and treated as the meta data to represent their contents. Theproblem of content based music data retrieval is then transformed into the string matchingproblem. A new approximate string matching algorithm is also proposed which provides faulttolerance ability according to the music characteristics.

An efficient algorithm for mining frequent sequences by a new strategy without support counting,Ding-Ying Chiu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Mining sequential patterns in large databases is an important research topic. The mainchallenge of mining sequential patterns is the high processing cost due to the large amountof data. We propose a new strategy called direct sequence comparison (abbreviated asDISC); which can find frequent sequences without having to compute the support counts ofnonfrequent sequences. The main difference between the DISC strategy and the previousworks is the way to prune nonfrequent sequences. The previous works are based on theantimonotone property; which prune the nonfrequent sequences according to the frequentsequences with shorter lengths. On the contrary; the DISC strategy prunes the nonfrequentsequences according to the other sequences with the same length. Moreover; wesummarize three strategies used in the previous works and design an efficient algorithm …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,77

Cooling effects of wetlands in an urban region: the case of Beijing,Ranhao Sun; Ailian Chen; Liding Chen; Yihe Lü,Abstract The cooling effects of wetlands; which form “urban cooling islands”(UCIs); areimportant for mitigating urban heat island effects. Ten reservoirs/lakes and five rivers inBeijing are selected to investigate UCI intensity using ASTER images. The UCI intensity isquantified by the temperature difference and gradient between the wetland and surroundinglandscapes. The results indicate that:(1) the UCI intensity is correlated with the landscapeshape index (LSI) of the wetlands; and the Spearman Rho is 0.679 between LSI andtemperature difference; and 0.568 between LSI and temperature gradient; and (2) the UCIintensity is also determined by the wetland location in relation to the downtown; and thecorrelation coefficient is 0.691 between the location and temperature difference; and 0.706between the location and temperature gradient.

A strategy for efficient access of multiple data items in mobile environments,Guanling Lee; Meng-Shin Yeh; Shou-Chih Lo; Arbee LP Chen,Many approaches have been proposed to schedule data items for broadcasting in a mobileenvironment. However; the issues of accessing multiple data items on the broadcastchannel are less discussed. In this paper; an efficient strategy for accessing multiple dataitems in mobile environments is proposed. Two issues are investigated in this paper; that is;deciding the content of the broadcast channel based on the queries from the clients; andscheduling the data items to be broadcast. Experiments are performed to compare ourproposed methods for deciding the content and to show that our data scheduling methodscan reduce the average access time without considerable increase on processing time.,Mobile Data Management; 2002.

Data allocation on wireless broadcast channels for efficient query processing,Guanling Lee; Shou-Chih Lo; Arbee LP Chen,Data broadcast is an excellent method for efficient data dissemination in the mobilecomputing environment. The application domain of data broadcast will be widely expandedin the near future; where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions onthe broadcast data. To reduce the access latency for processing the complex query; it isbeneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcastchannel. In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of thedata on the broadcast channel such that frequently co-accessed data are not only allocatedclose to each other; but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of queryprocessing. Our mechanism is based on the well-known problem named optimal linearordering. Experiments are performed to justify the benefit of our approach.,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2002,54
Prediction of web page accesses by proxy server log,Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract As the population of web users grows; the variety of user behaviors on accessinginformation also grows; which has a great impact on the network utilization. Recently; manyefforts have been made to analyze user behaviors on the WWW. In this paper; we representuser behaviors by sequences of consecutive web page accesses; derived from the accesslog of a proxy server. Moreover; the frequent sequences are discovered and organized asan index. Based on the index; we propose a scheme for predicting user requests and aproxy-based framework for prefetching web pages. We perform experiments on real data.The results show that our approach makes the predictions with a high degree of accuracywith little overhead. In the experiments; the best hit ratio of the prediction achieves 75.69%;while the longest time to make a prediction only requires 2.3 ms.,World Wide Web,2002,53
Improvement algorithms for semijoin query processing programs in distributed database systems,Arbee L. P.  Chen; Victor O. K.  Li,The problem of optimal query processing in distributed database systems was shown to beNP-hard. This means that heuristic algorithms are necessary to solve the query processingproblem. In this paper; we describe algorithms to improve the solutions generated byheuristics. We have identified four properties which optimal semijoin programs forprocessing tree queries have to satisfy. A semijoin program is represented by an executiongraph which specifies the order and the identities of the semijoins to be executed. Given asemijoin program; we can therefore apply these properties to check its optimality. If it doesnot satisfy these optimality properties; the associated improvement algorithms can beapplied to improve this program. No assumptions have been made about the relation sizeand the selectivity of the semijoins.,IEEE transactions on computers,1984,53
Content-based query processing for video databases,Tony CT Kuo; Arbee LP Chen,This paper presents a query processing strategy for the content-based video querylanguage named CVQL. By CVQL; users can flexibly specify query predicates by the spatialand temporal relationships of the content objects. The query processing strategy evaluatesthe predicates and returns qualified videos or frames as results. Before the evaluation of thepredicates; a preprocessing is performed to avoid unnecessary accessing of videos whichare impossible to be the answers. The preprocessing checks the existence of the contentobjects specified in the predicates to eliminate unqualified videos. For the evaluation of thepredicates; an M-index is designed based on the analysis of the behaviors of the contentobjects. The M-index is employed to avoid frame-by-frame evaluation of the predicates.Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of this approach.,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2000,51

The co-sputtered Zr–Cu films are all amorphous under various co-sputtering conditions; suggesting the high vitrification tendency. The amorphous Zr–Cu thinfilm will start to crystallize into nano-crystalline Zr 2 Cu and Zr 7 Cu 10 phases upon longexposure at temperatures above 350° C. On the other hand; it is difficult to form amorphousfilm with the Zr–Ti system; except at a low sputtering power of 30–50 W.

Efficient multifeature index structures for music data retrieval,Wegin Lee; Arbee LP Chen,In this paper; we propose four index structures for music data retrieval. Based on suffix trees;we develop two index structures called combined suffix tree and independent suffix trees.These methods still show shortcomings for some search functions. Hence we developanother index; called Twin Suffix Trees; to overcome these problems. However; the TwinSuffix Trees lack of scalability when the amount of music data becomes large. Therefore wepropose the fourth index; called Grid-Twin Suffix Trees; to provide scalability and flexibilityfor a large amount of music data. For each index; we can use different search functions; likeexact search and approximate search; on different music features; like melody; rhythm orboth. We compare the performance of the different search functions applied on each indexstructure by a series of experiments.,Storage and Retrieval for Media Databases 2000,1999,42

Moreover; a conversion functionmodifies this probability computation to minimize misdetection and loss of detection underunusual image pattern situations. A shot change probability threshold is defined for thevideo to be examined. When a frame's modified shot change probability exceeds thisthreshold; the frame is considered to contain a shot change.

Algorithms to process distributed queries in fast local networks,Keh-Chang Guh; Weining Zhang,We propose a scheme to make use of semantic information to process distributed querieslocally without data transfer with respect to the join clauses of the query. Since not allqueries can be processed without data transfer; we give an algorithm to recognize the"locally processable queries." For nonlocally processable queries; a simple" fragment andreplicate" algorithm is used. The algorithm chooses a relation to remain fragmented at thesites where they are situated while replicating the other relations at those sites. Ouralgorithm determines the chosen relation and the chosen copy of every fragment of thechosen relation such that the minimum response time is obtained. The algorithm runs inlinear time. If the fragments of the relation are allowed to be processed in other sites; thenthe problem is NP hard. Two heuristics are given for that situation.

Music classification using significant repeating patterns,Chang-Rong Lin; Ning-Han Liu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract With the popularity of multimedia applications; a large amount of music data hasbeen accumulated on the Internet. Automatic classification of music data becomes a criticaltechnique for providing an efficient and effective retrieval of music data. In this paper; wepropose a new approach for classifying music data based on their contents. In thisapproach; we focus on monophonic music features represented as rhythmic and melodicsequences. Moreover; we use repeating patterns of music data to do music classification.For each pattern discovered from a group of music data; we employ a series ofmeasurements to estimate its usefulness for classifying this group of music data. Accordingto the patterns contained in a music piece; we determine which class it should be assignedto. We perform a series of experiments and the results show that our approach performs …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,36
3D-List: a data structure for efficient video query processing,Chih-Chih Liu; Arbee LP Chen,A video query model based on the content of video and iconic indexing is proposed. Weextend the notion of two-dimensional strings to three-dimensional strings (3D-Strings) forrepresenting the spatial and temporal relationships among the symbols in both a video anda video query. The problem of video query processing is then transformed into a problem ofthree-dimensional pattern matching. To efficiently match the 3D-Strings; a data structure;called 3D-List; and its related algorithms are proposed. In this approach; the symbols of avideo in the video database are retrieved from the video index and organized as a 3D-Listaccording to the 3D-String of the video query. The related algorithms are then applied on the3D-List to determine whether this video is an answer to the video query. Based on thisapproach; we have started a project called Vega. In this project; we have implemented a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,36
Processing probabilistic spatio-temporal range queries over moving objects with uncertainty,Bruce SE Chung; Wang-Chien Lee; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Range queries for querying the current and future positions of the moving objectshave received growing interests in the research community. Existing methods; however;assume that an object only moves along an anticipated path. In this paper; we study theproblem of answering probabilistic range queries on moving objects based on anuncertainty model; which captures the possible movements of objects with probabilities.Evaluation of probabilistic queries is challenging due to large objects volume and costlycomputation. We map the uncertain movements of all objects to a dual space for indexing.By querying the index; we quickly eliminate unqualified objects and employ an approximateapproach to examine the remaining candidates for final answer. We conduct acomprehensive performance study; which shows our proposal significantly reduces the …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,34
Semantic video model for content-based retrieval,Jia-Ling Koh; Chin-Sung Lee; Arbee LP Chen,Traditional research on video data retrieval follows two general approaches. One is basedon text annotation and the other on content-based comparison. However these approachesdo not fully make use of the meaning implied in a video stream. To improve theseapproaches; a semantic video model cooperating with a knowledge database is studied. Wepropose a new semantic video model and focus on presenting the semantic meaningimplied in a video. According to the granularity of the meaning implied in a video; a five-levellayered structure to model a video stream is proposed. A mechanism is also provided toconstruct the five levels based on the knowledge categories defined in the knowledgedatabase. The five-level layered structure consists of raw-data levels and semantic-datalevels.

Efficient shot change detection on compressed video data,Tony CT Kuo; Yi-Bing Lin; Arbee LP Chen; S-C Chen; CY Ni,Video segmentation is an elementary operation for video index construction. A videosequence is usually decomposed into several basic meaningful segments. We propose anew approach to detect shot changes for video segmentation; which is based on theprocessing of MPEG compressed video data. This approach takes advantage of theinformation implied in the compressed data. The reference ratios among video frames areanalyzed to determine their similarities. A shot change is detected if the similarity degrees ofa frame and its adjacent frames are low. A function is used to quantize the results into theshot change probabilities. Considering the motion variations of video contents betweenframes; a conversion function is designed to increase the correctness of the shot changedetection. The experimental results show the performance of our approach.,Multimedia Database Management Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of International Workshop on,1996,32
Identifying object isomerism in multidatabase systems,Arbee LP Chen; Pauray SM Tsai; Jia-Ling Koh,Abstract In a multidatabase system that consists of object databases; the same real-worldentity can be stored as objects in different databases with incompatible object identifiers.How to identify and integrate these objects representing the same entities such that (a)object duplication in the query result can be avoided;(b) information for the entity can begathered; and (c) the specialization of multiple classes can be built is an important issue toprovide a well structured global object schema and a more informative query result. In thispaper; we extend our results on probabilistic query processing and joining relations onincompatible keys to solve the problem. Various data and schema conflicts such as missingdata; inconsistent data and domain mismatch which may exist in classes from differentdatabases are considered in the process of identification.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1996,32
On mapping natural language constructs into relational algebra through ER representation,Frank SC Tseng; Arbee LP Chen; Wei-Pang Yang,Abstract Research on accessing databases in natural language usually employs anintermediate form for the mapping process from natural language to database languages.However; much effort is needed to bridge the gap between the existing intermediate formsand the database languages. In this paper; we present a methodology to map naturallanguage constructs into relational algebra through ER representation. This methodologyemploys a logical form to represent the natural language queries. The logical form has themerits that it can be mapped from natural language constructs by referring to the Entity-Relationship conceptual schema and can be efficiently transformed into relational algebrafor query execution. The whole process provides a clear and natural framework forprocessing natural language queries to retrieve data from database systems.,Data & knowledge engineering,1992,32
A parallel execution method for minimizing distributed query response time,Chihping Wang; Arbee L. P.  Chen; S-C Shyu,Performance studies show that traditional semi-join processing methods are sometimesinefficient because of the storage and processing overhead. To remedy this problem; a newsemi-join processing method; called one-shot semi-join execution is proposed. This methodallows parallel generation of all the semi-join projections; parallel transmission of all thesemi-join projections; and parallel execution of all the semi-joins. The authors apply thismethod to optimize the response time for processing distributed queries. A response timemodel is established; which considers both data transmission time and local processingtime. Based on this model; an efficient query processing algorithm is developed andanalyzed.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1992,32
Distributed query processing a multiple database system,Arbee LP Chen; David Brill; Marjorie Templeton; CLEMENT T Yu,Mermaid is a testbed system which provides integrated access to multiple databases. Twoquery optimization algorithms have been developed for Mermaid. The semijoin algorithmtends to reduce the data transmission cost; while the replicate algorithm reduces theprocessing cost. An algorithm that integrates the features of these two algorithms to optimizethe processing cost as well as the transmission cost is presented. A dynamic networkenvironment is considered where processing speeds at each site and transmission speedsat each link can be variable. Moreover; distributed processing of aggregates is consideredbased on the functional dependency among the fragment attribute; the aggregate attribute;and the group-by attribute.

Querying uncertain data in heterogeneous databases,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,In heterogeneous databases; the user may issue a query to joint two relations in differentdatabases on the keys. However; the keys may be incompatible. The authors extend resultson probabilistic query processing to consider joining two relations with incompatible keys. Anew approach to identify the'same'entities in different relations is proposed. Various dataand schema conflicts such as missing data; inconsistent data and domain mismatch areconsidered in the identification process. Probabilistic techniques are used to estimate thesameness of two entities; to process queries; and to estimate the degree of uncertainty forthe query results.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1993: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1993.

A probabilistic approach to query processing in heterogeneous database systems,F Shou-Cheng Tseng; Arbee LP Chen; Wei-Pang Yang,In heterogeneous database systems; partial values can be used to resolve theinteroperability problems; including domain mismatch; inconsistent data; and missing data.Performing operations on partial values may produce maybe tuples in the query result whichcannot be compared. Thus; users have no way to distinguish which maybe tuple is the mostpossible answer. The concept of partial values is generalized to probabilistic partial values.The authors develop a full set of extended relational operators for manipulating relationscontaining probabilistic partial values. With this approach; the uncertain answer tuples of aquery are associated with degrees of uncertainty. That provides users a comparison amongmaybe tuples and a better understanding on the query results. Besides; extended selectionand join are generalized to alpha-selection and alpha-join; respectively; which can be …,Research Issues on Data Engineering; 1992: Transaction and Query Processing; Second International Workshop on,1992,31
Efficient and robust schemes for sensor data aggregation based on linear counting,Yao-Chung Fan; Arbee LP Chen,Sensor networks have received considerable attention in recent years; and are oftenemployed in the applications where data are difficult or expensive to collect.

Efficient graph-based algorithms for discovering and maintaining association rules in large databases,Guanling Lee; KL Lee; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract. In this paper; we study the issues of mining and maintaining association rules in alarge database of customer transactions. The problem of mining association rules can bemapped into the problems of finding large itemsets which are sets of items brought togetherin a sufficient number of transactions. We revise a graph-based algorithm to further speed upthe process of itemset generation. In addition; we extend our revised algorithm to maintaindiscovered association rules when incremental or decremental updates are made to thedatabases. Experimental results show the efficiency of our algorithms. The revised algorithmis a significant improvement over the original one on mining association rules.

An efficient approach for incremental association rule mining,Pauray SM Tsai; Chih-Chong Lee; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we study the issue of maintaining association rules in a largedatabase of sales transactions. The maintenance of association rules can be mapped intothe problem of maintaining large itemsets in the database. Because the mining ofassociation rules is time-consuming; we need an efficient approach to maintain the largeitemsets when the database is updated. In this paper; we present efficient approaches tosolve the problem. Our approaches store the itemsets that are not large at present but maybecome large itemsets after updating the database; so that the cost of processing theupdated database can be reduced. Moreover; we discuss the cases where the largeitemsets can be obtained without scanning the original database.

Past transaction data can be analyzed todiscover customer purchasing behaviors such that the quality of business decision can beimproved. The association rules describe the associations among items in the largedatabase of customer transactions. However; the size of the database can be very large. It isvery time consuming to find all the association rules from a large database; and users maybe only interested in the associations among some items. Moreover; the criteria of thediscovered rules for the user requirements may not be the same. Many uninterestingassociation rules for the user requirements can be generated when traditional miningmethods are applied.

Determining k-most demanding products with maximum expected number of total customers,Chen-Yi Lin; Jia-Ling Koh; Arbee LP Chen,In this paper; a problem of production plans; named k-most demanding products (k-MDP)discovering; is formulated. Given a set of customers demanding a certain type of productswith multiple attributes; a set of existing products of the type; a set of candidate products thatcan be offered by a company; and a positive integer k; we want to help the company toselect k products from the candidate products such that the expected number of the totalcustomers for the k products is maximized.

A novel hash-based approach for mining frequent itemsets over data streams requiring less memory space,En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In recent times; data are generated as a form of continuous data streams in manyapplications. Since handling data streams is necessary and discovering knowledge behinddata streams can often yield substantial benefits; mining over data streams has become oneof the most important issues. Many approaches for mining frequent itemsets over datastreams have been proposed. These approaches often consist of two procedures includingcontinuously maintaining synopses for data streams and finding frequent itemsets from thesynopses. However; most of the approaches assume that the synopses of data streams canbe saved in memory and ignore the fact that the information of the non-frequent itemsetskept in the synopses may cause memory utilization to be significantly degraded. In thispaper; we consider compressing the information of all the itemsets into a structure with a …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2009,27
A localized approach to distributed query processing,Arbee LP Chen,Abstract To process queries against a global schema in a distributed multidatabase system;query transformation which maps the query against the global schema to the local schemasis necessary. In this paper; a localized approach is presented which optimizes distributedquery processing. This approach transforms a query to subqueries. Each subqueryreferences data contained at a local site and therefore can be locally processed. It reducesdata transmission time and query response time due to local processing and parallelprocessing. It can therefore be applied in distributed database systems implemented ineither long-haul or local networks. Moreover; semantic information can be incorporated withthis approach to process distributed queries at a single site.

Adaptive techniques for distributed query optimization,C Yu; Leszek Lilien; K Guh; H Templeton; David Brill; A Chen,We propose new adaptive techniques for distributed query optimization. These techniquesare divided into two groups: the ones that improve efficiency of query execution (directly)and the ones that improve cost estimations for query execution strategies. Some of theproposed techniques utilize semantic information and knowledge acquisition to adapt to theenvironment. The latter; in contrast to the former; is not a well-established idea. This is adisturbing fact since knowledge acquisition can give significant improvements inperformance of a query optimization algorithm. Performing analysis manually is extrernelytime consuming and tedious. Therefore; some learning capacity should be added to thesystem. Some knowledge acquisition techniques that result in adaptive (dynamic)adjustment to run-time changes are proposed.,Data Engineering; 1986 IEEE Second International Conference on,1986,27
An optimal algorithm for processing distributed star queries,Arbee L. P.  Chen; Victor O. K.  Li,The problem of optimal query processing in distributed database systems was shown to beNP-hard. However; for a special type of queries called star queries; we have developed apolynomial optimal algorithm. Semijoin tactics are applied for query processing. Anexecution graph is introduced to represent the semijoin programs associated with thedistributed processing of the queries. We then identify optimality properties of semijoinprograms for star queries; and use these properties to derive the optimal semijoin program.We have shown that the optimal semijoin program can be found from serial semijoinstrategies; defined as serial semijoin programs which include each semijoin associated withthe query exactly once. By making certain assumptions on the file sizes and the semijoinselectivities; we can obtain the optimal semijoin program from these strategies in …,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1985,25

Supporting conceptual and neighborhood queries on the world wide web,C-S Chang; Arbee LP Chen,A document retrieval system mainly consists of three components: document representation;user queries; and document evaluation. Each component may involve some uncertainties.Fuzzy set theory is a natural approach to coping with the representation of documents;queries; and the relevance of documents to a given query. The authors propose a fuzzydocument retrieval model on the World Wide Web (WWW) environment to supportconceptual queries. A flexible query expression is proposed to support different semantics ofthe queries. A concept network is adopted as the knowledge base to represent therelevance of the concepts. The concept network is explored from the WWW. Moreover; theyalso support neighborhood queries; which retrieve documents relevant to a documentspecified by a user. A system is currently being implemented to achieve these functions.,IEEE Transactions on Systems; Man; and Cybernetics; Part C (Applications and Reviews),1998,24
How many metrics are required to identify the effects of the landscape pattern on land surface temperature?,Ailian Chen; Lei Yao; Ranhao Sun; Liding Chen,Abstract Urban heat island (UHI) is a global issue as a result of urbanization. Land surfacetemperature (LST) is closely related to the thermal environment and energy budget of theearth surface; and is an important parameter in identifying UHI effects. Previous studies haveproved the effects of landscape pattern on LST by using landscape metrics. However; themetrics used were inconsistent in number and type. Further; fewer studies tried to selectrepresentative metrics from the numerous metrics for LST indication. In this study we tried toexplore the effects of landscape pattern on LST in Beijing by using the representative classlevel metrics selected through cluster analysis; factor analysis and regression.

The analysis of relationships in databases for rule derivation,Show-Jane Yen; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Owing to the rapid growth in the sizes of databases; potentially useful informationmay be embeded in a large amount of data. Knowledge discovery is the search for semanticrelationships which exist in large databases. One of the main problems for knowledgediscovery is that the number of possible relationships can be very large; thus searching forinteresting relationships and reducing the search complexity are important. Therelationships can be represented as rules which can be used in efficient query processing.We present a technique to analyze relationships among attribute values and to derivecompact rule set.

In practice most of the parameters needed for queryoptimization; such as relation cardinality and selectivity; are of fixed-precision. Imposing thisfixed-precision constraint; an efficient distributed query processing algorithm is developed.For situations where the fixed-precision constraint does not apply; a method to truncate theparameters and to use the same algorithm to find near-optimal solutions is proposed.

Refining imprecise data by integrity constraints,Frank SC Tseng; Arbee LP Chen; Wei-Pang Yang,Abstract Uncertain data in databases were originally denoted as null values; whichrepresent the meaning of 'values unknown at present.” Null values were generalized intopartial values; which correspond to a set of possible values; to provide a more powerfulnotion. In this paper; we derive some properties to refine partial values into more informativeones. In some cases; they can even be refined into definite values. Such a refinement ispossible when there exist range constraint on attribute domains; or referential integrities;functional dependencies; or multivalued dependencies among attributes.

On-line rule matching for event prediction,Chung-Wen Cho; Yi-Hung Wu; Show-Jane Yen; Ying Zheng; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The prediction of future events has great importance in many applications. Theprediction is based on episode rules which are composed of events and two time constraintswhich require all the events in the episode rule and in the predicate of the rule to occur in atime interval; respectively. In an event stream; a sequence of events which matches thepredicate of the rule satisfying the specified time constraint is called an occurrence of thepredicate. After finding the occurrence; the consequent event which will occur in a timeinterval can be predicted. However; the time intervals computed from some occurrences forpredicting the event can be contained in the time intervals computed from other occurrenceand become redundant. As a result; how to design an efficient and effective event predictorin a stream environment is challenging. In this paper; an effective scheme is proposed to …,The VLDB Journal,2011,18

A new descriptor is proposed to represent the motion track in theXY plane and the trend of velocity changes. Moreover; a new similarity measure forcomparing two motion tracks based on the motion trajectory and velocity differences isproposed. The trajectory is compared by the properties of the polynomials; and the velocityis compared by the different trends. Furthermore; the motion track segmentation method isproposed to handle a complicated motion behavior and the relevance feedback is used toimprove the query results.

In the past; we had developed a hash-based approach for mining frequentitemsets over a single data stream. In this paper; we extend that approach to mine globalfrequent itemsets from a collection of data streams distributed at distinct remote sites. Tospeed up the mining process; we make the first attempt to address a new problem oncontinuously maintaining a global synopsis for the union of all the distributed streams. Themining results therefore can be yielded on demand by directly processing the maintainedglobal synopsis. Instead of collecting and processing all the data in a central server; whichmay waste the computation resources of remote sites; distributed computations over the datastreams are performed.

With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions canhave; it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in theurban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing.

Continuous evaluation of fastest path queries on road networks,Chia-Chen Lee; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The one-shot shortest path query has been studied for decades. However; in theapplications on road networks; users are actually interested in the path with the minimumtravel time (the fastest path); which varies as time goes. This motivates us to study thecontinuous evaluation of fastest path queries in order to capture the dynamics of roadnetworks. Repeatedly evaluating a large number of fastest path queries at every moment isinfeasible due to its computationally expensive cost. We propose a novel approach thatemploys the concept of the affecting area and the tolerance parameter to avoid thereevaluation while the travel time of the current answer is close enough to that of the fastestpath.

An efficient approach to extracting approximate repeating patterns in music databases,Ning-Han Liu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Pattern extraction from music strings is an important problem. The patternsextracted from music strings can be used as features for music retrieval or analysis. Previousworks on music pattern extraction only focus on exact repeating patterns. However; musicsegments with minor differences may sound similar. The concept of the prototypical melodyhas therefore been proposed to represent these similar music segments. In musicology; thenumber of music segments that are similar to a prototypical melody implies the importancedegree of the prototypical melody to the music work. In this paper; a novel approach isdeveloped to extract all the prototypical melodies in a music work.

In addition; a mapping graph is used to describe the mapping equation. Accordingto the mapping information; the mechanism to process global queries is introduced. Oneprocessing unit is responsible to decompose the global query into the subqueries againstthe component databases. Moreover; to handle the effects of schema restructuring …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1995: Distributed Object Management; Proceedings. RIDE-DOM'95. Fifth International Workshop on,1995,16
Schema integration and query processing for multiple object databases,Arbee LP Chen; Jia-Ling Koh; Tony CT Kuo; Chih-Chin Liu,Abstract In a multiple database system; a global schema created by integrating schemas ofthe component databases provides a uniform interface and high level location transparencyfor the users to retrieve data. The main problem for constructing a global schema is toresolve conflicts among component schemas. In this paper; we define correspondingassertions for the database administrators to specify the semantic correspondences amongcomponent object schemas. Based on these assertions; integration rules are designed;which use a set of primitive integration operators to restructure the component schemas forresolving the conflicts and do the integration. The principle of our integration strategy is tokeep the data of component databases retrievable from the global schema without losinginformation. Moreover; more informative query answers may be derived from the multiple …,Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering,1995,16
Partitioning relation for parallel processing in fast local networks,C Yu; K Guh; David Brill; Arbee LP Chen,A partition-and-replicate strategy for processing distributed queries referencing nofragmented relation is sketched. An algorithm is given to determine which relation and whichcopy of the relation is to be partitioned into fragments; how the relation is to be partitioned;and where the fragments are to be sent for processing. Simulation results show that thepartition strategy is useful for processing queries in fast local network environments. Theresults also show that the number of partitions does not need to be large. The use ofsemijoins in the partition strategy is discussed. A necessary and sufficient condition for asemijoin to yield an improvement is provided.,Proceedings of the 1986 International Conference on Parallel Processing (Cat. No. 86CH2355-6),1986,16
Discovering leaders from social network by action cascade,Ming-Feng Tsai; Chih-Wei Tzeng; Zhe-Li Lin; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract This paper proposes an approach to discover community leaders in a socialnetwork by means of a probabilistic time-based graph propagation model. In the study;community leaders are defined as those people who initiate a lot of influence chainsaccording to the number of chains they belong to. To conduct the approach; we define anexponential time-decay function to measure the influence of leaders and construct thechains of leaders' action-specific influence. Then; we build the general chains bynormalizing over all possible users' actions. In specific; this paper uses the variant of theApriori algorithm called APPM to mine users' influence paths. To the best of our knowledge;this work is the first attempt to use the action-specific influence chains for mining communityleaders from a social network. In our experiments; two datasets are collected to examine …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2014,15
Continuous probabilistic skyline queries over uncertain data streams,Hui Zhu Su; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Recently; some approaches of finding probabilistic skylines on uncertain data havebeen proposed. In these approaches; a data object is composed of instances; eachassociated with a probability. The probabilistic skyline is then defined as a set of non-dominated objects with probabilities exceeding or equaling a given threshold. In manyapplications; data are generated as a form of continuous data streams. Accordingly; wemake the first attempt to study a problem of continuously returning probabilistic skylines overuncertain data streams in this paper. Moreover; the sliding window model over data streamsis considered here. To avoid recomputing the probability of being not dominated for eachuncertain object according to the instances contained in the current window; our main ideais to estimate the bounds of these probabilities for early determining which objects can be …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,15
Efficient frequent sequence mining by a dynamic strategy switching algorithm,Ding-Ying Chiu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee L Chen,Abstract Mining frequent sequences in large databases has been an important researchtopic. The main challenge of mining frequent sequences is the high processing cost due tothe large amount of data. In this paper; we propose a novel strategy to find all the frequentsequences without having to compute the support counts of non-frequent sequences. Theprevious works prune candidate sequences based on the frequent sequences with shorterlengths; while our strategy prunes candidate sequences according to the non-frequentsequences with the same lengths. As a result; our strategy can cooperate with the previousworks to achieve a better performance. We then identify three major strategies used in theprevious works and combine them with our strategy into an efficient algorithm. The novelty ofour algorithm lies in its ability to dynamically switch from a previous strategy to our new …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,15
Efficient kNN search in polyphonic music databases using a lower bounding mechanism,Ning-Han Liu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Querying polyphonic music from a large data collection is an interesting topic.Recently; researchers have attempted to provide efficient methods for content-basedretrieval in polyphonic music databases where queries are polyphonic. However; most ofthem do not work well for similarity search; which is important to many applications. In thispaper; we propose three polyphonic representations with the associated similarity measuresand a novel method to retrieve k music works that contain segments most similar to thequery. In general; most of the index-based methods for similarity search generate all thepossible answers to the query and then perform exact matching on the index for eachpossible answer. Based on the edit distance; our method generates only a few possibleanswers by performing the deletion and/or replacement operations on the query. Each …,Multimedia systems,2005,15
Music segmentation by rhythmic features and melodic shapes,Hung-Chen Chen; Chih-Hsiang Lin; Arbee LP Chen,According to musicology; musical content and musical structure are both major componentsof a music work. Most approaches of music retrieval; classification; and analysis use theinformation of the musical content; but not the information of the musical structure. The mainreason is that the musical structure usually needs to be analyzed manually by experts; whichis time-consuming and impractical. We propose an approach for automatic musicsegmentation to extract the phrases and sentences of the musical structure. In addition to therhythmic features; the melodic shape is also used to improve the effectiveness of the musicsegmentation. Experiments are performed to show that our approach is practical.,Multimedia and Expo; 2004. ICME'04. 2004 IEEE International Conference on,2004,15
Optimizing queries with foreign functions in a distributed environment,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,Foreign functions have been considered in the advanced database systems to supportcomplex applications. We consider optimizing queries with foreign functions in a distributedenvironment. In traditional distributed query processing; selection operations are locallyprocessed before joins as much as possible so that the size of relations being transmittedand joined can be reduced. However; if selection predicates involve foreign functions; thecost of evaluating selections cannot be ignored. As a result; the execution order of selectionsand joins becomes significant; and the trade-off for reducing the costs of data transmission;join processing; and selection predicate evaluation needs to be carefully considered inquery optimization. A response time model is developed for estimating the cost of distributedquery processing involving foreign functions. We explore the property of the problem and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,15
Effects of typographic variables on eye-movement measures in reading Chinese from a screen,Nai-Shing Yen; Jie-Li Tsai; Pei-Ling Chen; Hsuan-Yu Lin; Arbee LP Chen,To investigate the most efficient way to represent text in reading Chinese on computerdisplays; three typographic variables; character size (41′ arc/24 pixels and 60′ arc/32pixels); character spacing (1/4 and 1/8 character width) and font type (Kai and Ming); weremanipulated. Results showed that the reading speed for Chinese characters of Kai type in24 pixels with 1/8 character spacing was the shortest. Character size significantly affectedoverall reading speed; in specific; text in 24-pixel characters was read faster than text in 32-pixel characters. Further eye-movement analyses revealed that text in smaller-sizedcharacters had longer fixation duration; fewer fixations and fewer regressions than text inlarger-sized characters. The interaction between character spacing and font type wasobserved on overall reading efficiency and on some eye-movement measures; which …,Behaviour & Information Technology,2011,14
Energy efficient schemes for accuracy-guaranteed sensor data aggregation using scalable counting,Yao-Chung Fan; Arbee LP Chen,Sensor networks have received considerable attention in recent years; and are employed inmany applications. In these applications; statistical aggregates such as Sum over thereadings of a group of sensor nodes are often needed. One challenge for computing sensordata aggregates comes from the communication failures; which are common in sensornetworks. To enhance the robustness of the aggregate computation; multipath-basedaggregation is often used. However; the multipath-based aggregation suffers from theproblem of overcounting sensor readings. The approaches using the multipath-basedaggregation therefore need to incorporate techniques that avoid overcounting sensorreadings. In this paper; we present a novel technique named scalable counting for efficientlyavoiding the overcounting problem. We focus on having an (ε; δ) accuracy guarantee for …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,13
Efficient index and data allocation for wireless broadcast services,Shou-Chih Lo; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The periodic broadcasting of frequently requested data can reduce the workload ofuplink channels and improve data access for users in a wireless network. Since mobiledevices have limited energy capacities associated with their reliance on battery power; it isimportant to minimize the time and energy spent on accessing broadcast data. The indexingand scheduling of broadcast data play a key role in this problem. In this paper; we formulatethe index and data allocation problem and propose a solution that can adapt to any numberof broadcast channels. We first restrict the considered problem to a scenario with noindex/data replication; and introduce an optimal solution and a heuristic solution to thesingle-channel and multichannel cases; respectively. Then; we discuss how to replicateindexes on the allocation to further improve the performance. The results from some …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,13

The key issue; which affects the performance of the whole system; isthe location management. Current systems group cells into location regions to reduce thelocation management cost which includes the location tracking cost and the registration cost.In this paper; by considering users' movement behaviors; four strategies are proposed toderive location regions. These strategies attempt to simultaneously reduce the locationtracking cost and the registration cost.

Efficient graph-based algorithm for discovering and maintaining knowledge in large databases,KL Lee; Guanling Lee; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we study the issues of mining and maintaining association rules in alarge database of customer transactions. The problem of mining association rules can bemapped into the problems of finding large itemsets which are sets of items bought togetherin a sufficient number of transactions. We revise a graph-based algorithm to further speed upthe process of itemset generation. In addition; we extend our revised algorithm to maintaindiscovered association rules when incremental or decremental updates are made to thedatabases. Experimental results show the efficiency of our algorithms. The revised algorithmsignificantly improves over the original one on mining association rules. The algorithms formaintaining association rules are more efficient than re-running the mining algorithms for thewhole updated database and outperform previously proposed algorithms that need …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,1999,13
Retrieving video data via motion tracks of content symbols,Tim TY Wai; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Motion is the major feature that differentiates a video from a still image. In content-based retrieval; the motion track of a symbol object can be used as an index of videodatabases. Query processing based on such index can be treated as a curve matchingproblem. Two important criteria for solving the problem are sub-matching and approximate-matching. In this paper; two query processing approaches are proposed. The first approachexpands the motion track index to a region and allows a user to query against this region. Inthe second approach; both the motion track index and the query curve are modeled as acombination of peaks and each peak is coded according to its orientation; angle andtemporal information. The curve matching problem is then converted into a string matchingproblem; which is solved efficiently by a new finite automata based method.

An exploration of relationships among exclusive disjunctive data,Jui-Shang Chiu; Arbee L. P.  Chen,We elaborate on how to interpret the query answer on exclusive disjunctive databases andhow to reduce the query answer into a more concise form. Exclusive disjunctive data arerepresented as a pair of value set and variable set in Pv-table which is an extension of therelational model. A value set corresponds to a finite set of possible values in which exactlyone value is the true value. By variable sets; tuples may be related with certain relationships;namely disjunctive relationship and join relationship. Three kinds of tuple sets are classifiedaccording to these relationships; each possesses an important property; namely co-exist; co-nonempty; or co-instance. Based on these properties; the interpretation of Pv-tables can beformalized in a semantically meaningful way; Also; the redundant and mergeable tuples canbe identified. After removing and merging tuples accordingly; a more concise Pv-table …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1995,13
Deriving Optimal Semijoin Programs for Distributed Query Processing,Arbee LP Chen; Victor OK Li,The authors identify some optimality properties of a special type of tree queries; namely starqueries; and use these properties to derive the optimal program. They first prove that theoptimal program will be embedded in serial semi-join strategies; defined as serial semi-joinprograms which include each semi-join associated with the query exactly once. An algorithmis then developed to derive all candidate optimal programs from these serial strategies.Comparing the total data transmission cost of these candidate optimal programs; it ispossible to arrive at the optimal. No assumptions have been made about the relation sizeand the selectivity of the semi-joins. The possibility of including multiple occurrences ofsome semi-joins in the optimal program is considered. Since the number of join clauses inmost of the queries in an operational environment is small; this approach allows one to …,Proceedings of the IEEE INFOCOM 84 (IEEE Cat. No. 84CH2012-3),1984,13
A better strategy of discovering link-pattern based communities by classical clustering methods,Chen-Yi Lin; Jia-Ling Koh; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The definition of a community in social networks varies with applications. Togeneralize different types of communities; the concept of link-pattern based community wasproposed in a previous study to group nodes into communities; where the nodes in acommunity have similar intra-community and inter-community interaction behaviors. In thispaper; by defining centroid of a community; a distance function is provided to measure thesimilarity between the link pattern of a node and the centroid of a community. The problem ofdiscovering link-pattern based communities is transformed into a data clustering problem onnodes for minimizing a given objective function. By extending the partitioning methods ofcluster analysis; two algorithms named G-LPC and KM-LPC are proposed to solve theproblem. The experiment results show that KM-LPC outperforms the previous work on the …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2010,12
Finding Approximate Repeating Patterns from Sequence Data.,Jia-Lien Hsu; Arbee LP Chen; Hung-Chen Chen,ABSTRACT In this paper; an application of feature extraction from music data is firstintroduced to motivate our research of finding approximate repeating patterns fromsequence data. An approximate repeating pattern is defined as a sequence of symbolswhich appears more than once under certain approximation types in a data sequence. Byusing the 'cut'and 'pattern_join'operators; we develop a level-wise approach to solve theproblem of finding approximate repeating patterns.,ISMIR,2004,12
Improving distributed query processing by hash-semijoins,Judy CR Tseng; Arbee LP Chen,The semijoin is an effective relational operator which is often applied in distributed queryprocessing to reduce data transmission cost. A semijoin operation is said to be cost-effectiveif the benefit obtained exceeds the cost of executing it. In this paper; we propose a newrelational operator; called a hashsemijoin; to greatly reduce the cost by sacrificing somebenefits. This new operator is designed based on the concept of search filters. We formulatea sequence of theorems and devise an algorithm to transform a semijoin program into amore cost-effective one by backware replacing certain traditional semijoins with hash-semijoins.,J.

Continuously matching episode rules for predicting future events over event streams,Chung-Wen Cho; Ying Zheng; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Predicting future events has great importance in many applications. Generally; ruleswith predicate events and consequent events are mined out; and then current events arematched with the predicate ones to predict the occurrence of consequent events. Manyprevious works focus on the rule mining problem; however; little emphasis has beenattached to the problem of predicate events matching. As events often arrive in a stream;how to design an efficient and effective event predictor becomes challenging. In this paper;we give a clear definition of this problem and propose our own method. We develop anevent filter and incrementally maintain parts of the matching results. By running a series ofexperiments; we show that our method is efficient and effective in the stream environment.,*,2007,11
Vega: A multimedia database system supporting content-based retrieval,Chih-Chin Liu; Arbee LP Chen,In this paper; we discuss important issues in designing and implementing a multimediadatabase system. First; we describe features used to model the content of image; video andmusic data. Based on the object model; we propose a multimedia framework and an object-level spatial/temporal model to represent the spatial/temporal relationships between mediaobjects. Three new types of aggregation relationships composed of composition; temporal;and spatial relationships are considered in the framework. To support content-basedretrieval; we propose a multimedia query language and two kinds of query interfaces forusers to specify content-based queries. Finally; two kinds of multimedia query processingtechniques are addressed.,Journal of Information Science and Engineering,1997,11
Searching a minimal semantically-equivalent subset of a set of partial values,Frank SC Tseng; Arbee LP Chen; Wei Pang Yang,Abstract Imprecise data exist in databases due to their unavailability or to data/schemaincompatibilities in a multidatabase system. Partial values have been used to representimprecise data. Manipulation of partial values is therefore necessary to process queriesinvolving imprecise data. In this article; we study the problem of eliminating redundant partialvalues that result from a projection on an attribute with partial values. The redundancy ofpartial values is defined through the interpretation of a set of partial values. This problem isequivalent to searching a minimal semantically-equivalent subset of a set of partial values. Asemantically-equivalent subset contains exactly the same information as the original set. Wederive a set of useful properties and apply a graph matching technique to develop anefficient algorithm for searching such a minimal subset and therefore eliminating …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,1993,11
One-shots emi-join execution strategies for processing distributed join queries,Chhping Wang; Victor OK Li; Arbee LP Chen,We apply the one shot semi-join execution strategy; which allows parallelism and processesmultiple semi-joins simultaneously; to optimize the transmission cost of distributed queries.The query optimization problem based on this strategy is NP-hard. Nevertheless; in practicemost of the parameters needed for query optimization; such as relation cardinality andselectivity; are of fixed-precision; ie their binary representations have no more than a fixednumber of digits after the binary point. Imposing this fixed-precision constraint; we developan efficient distributed query processing algorithm. For situations where the fixed-precisionconstraint doe not apply; we propose a method to truncate the parameters and use the samealgorithm to find near-optimal solutions. By analyzing the truncation errors; we provide aquantitative comparison between the near-optimal solutions and the optimal ones.,Computer Systems Science and Engineering,1993,11
Properties of optimal semi-join programs for distributed query processing,Arbee LP Chen; Victor OK Lo,The properties of optimal semi-join programs for processing distributed tree queries areinvestigated. The execution graph is introduced to represent semi-join programs andtechniques are described to rearrange the execution graph to improve the program. A newapproach for processing join clauses in two steps is suggested. Three important optimalityproperties of semi-join programs are then identified. No assumptions have been made aboutthe relation size and the selectivity of the semi-joins. These properties can be used to checkthe optimality of semi-join programs and to improve nonoptimal semi-join programs.Moreover; using these properties; one can develop an efficient algorithm to derive anoptimal semi-join program by exhaustive search. These properties also indicate that a semi-join may be included more than once in the optimal semi-join program,Proceedings COMPSAC 83: The IEEE Computer Society's Seventh International Computer Software and Applications Conference; 476-83,1983,11

A tree-based approach for event prediction using episode rules over event streams,Chung-Wen Cho; Ying Zheng; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Event prediction over event streams is an important problem with broadapplications. For this problem; rules with predicate events and consequent events are given;and then current events are matched with the predicate events to predict future events. Overthe event stream; some matches of predicate events may trigger duplicate predictions; andan effective scheme is proposed to avoid such redundancies. Based on the scheme; wepropose a novel approach CBS-Tree to efficiently match the predicate events over eventstreams. The CBS-Tree approach maintains the recently arrived events as a tree structure;and an efficient algorithm is proposed for the matching of predicate events on the treestructure; which avoids exhaustive scans of the arrived events. By running a series ofexperiments; we show that our approach is more efficient than the previous work for most …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,9

Neighborhood/conceptual query answering with imprecise/incomplete data,Show-Jane Yen; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The evolution of database systems tends to the development of higher degree ofuser-friendliness such that the system can be directly handled by nonprofessionals. In orderto reach this goal; the database system needs to provide a query language by which queriescan be specified conceptually. Also; the query condition may be relaxed such thatinformation within a certain semantic distance to the exact answer can be obtained.Moreover; the real-world information is usually imprecise and incomplete. It is thereforeimportant to store imprecise and incomplete information in a database; and to manipulatethis information accordingly. In this paper; we provide a conceptual query language bywhich fuzzy query conditions and neighborhood query conditions can be specified. Queryprocessing strategies for these two query conditions are proposed considering imprecise …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1993,9

Application of a new integrated landscape index to predict potential urban heat islands,Ailian Chen; Xinfeng Zhao; Lei Yao; Liding Chen,Abstract Studies on the interactions between urban landscape patterns and land surfacetemperatures are the key to urban heat island (UHI) mitigation. However; the landscapepattern indices used in previous studies were inconsistent in type and number. Furthermore;few studies combined the composition and configuration indices into one integratedindicator. The description of landscape pattern is thus a great yet rewarding challenge. Inthis study; we used the integrated location weighted landscape index (LWLI) proposed byChen et al.(2009) and revised it to indicate potential UHIs. Fifty-six circular landscapesamples along four transects were created and the LWLI was derived based on the theory ofthe GINI index. The LWLI considers the type; composition and configuration of different landcovers inside a landscape; where configuration is treated as location weights. The …,Ecological indicators,2016,8

Top-n query processing in spatial databases considering bi-chromatic reverse k-nearest neighbors,Cha-Lun Li; En Tzu Wang; Guo-Jhu Huang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract A reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) query retrieves the data points which regardthe query point as one of their respective k nearest neighbors. A bi-chromatic reverse k-nearest neighbor (BRkNN) query is a variant of the RkNN query; considering two types ofdata. Given two types of data G and C; a BRkNN query regarding a data point q in Gretrieves the data points from C that regard q as one of their respective k-nearest neighborsamong the data points in G. Many existing approaches answer either the RkNN query or theBRkNN query. Different from these approaches; in this paper; we make the first attempt topropose a top-n query based on the concept of BRkNN queries; which ranks the data pointsin G and retrieves the top-n points according to the cardinalities of the correspondingBRkNN answer sets.

Scheduling real-time data items in multiple channels and multiple receivers environments,Guanling Lee; Yi-Ning Pan; Arbee LP Chen,The problem of transmitting data items with timing constraint in the multiple broadcastchannels where clients equipped with multiple receivers is studied. In our approach; thedata items are divided into two sets; the broadcast data set and the on-demand data set. Thedata items in the broadcast data set is periodically broadcast on the broadcast channelswhile the data items in the on-demand data set are transmitted when they are requested.The server offline allocates the data items in the broadcast data set to the multiple broadcastchannels. The clients retrieved data items from the broadcast channels are guaranteed toreceive them within the timing constraint. Once the desired data item is not included in thebroadcast channels; clients make requests associated with deadlines to the server. By usingthe bandwidth remaining for the on-demand mode; the server broadcasts the requested …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2002. Proceedings. 22nd International Conference on,2002,8
Efficient near neighbor searching using multi-indexes for content-based multimedia data retrieval,Chih-Chin Liu; Jia-Lien Hsu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Many content-based multimedia data retrieval problems can be transformed into thenear neighbor searching problem in multidimensional feature space. An efficient nearneighbor searching algorithm is needed when developing a multimedia database system. Inthis paper; we propose an approach to efficiently solve the near neighbor searchingproblem. In this approach; along each dimension an index is constructed according to thevalues of feature points of multimedia objects. A user can pose a content-based query byspecifying a multimedia query example and a similarity measure. The specified queryexample will be transformed into a query point in the multi-dimensional feature space. Thepossible result points in each dimension are then retrieved by searching the value of thequery point in the corresponding dimension. The sets of the possible result points are …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2001,8
Aggregate functions over probabilistic data,Chih-Shyang Chang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Various extended relational data models were proposed to handle uncertain dataincluding possibilistic and probabilistic data. Query processing involving aggregatefunctions over uncertain data is rarely considered. In this paper; we define a set of extendedaggregate functions over probabilistic data. The time complexity of the computations forthese extended aggregate functions is; in general; exponential. We develop two efficientalgorithms for the computation of the maximum and minimum aggregate functions. The worst-case time complexity of the algorithms are O (n 2). These algorithms can be extended tohandle the possibilistic data. That is; our work is devoted to the accommodation of uncertaindata in database systems with an elaboration on speeding up the processing efficiency ofthe aggregate functions.,Information sciences,1996,8

A framework for enabling user preference profiling through Wi-Fi logs,Yao-Chung Fan; Yu-Chi Chen; Kuan-Chieh Tung; Kuo-Chen Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Nowadays; mobile devices have become a ubiquitous medium supporting various forms offunctionality and are widely accepted for commons. In this study; we investigate using Wi-Filogs from a mobile device to discover user preferences. The core ideas are two folds. First;every Wi-Fi access point is with a network name; normally a human-readable string; calledSSID (Service Set Identifier). Since SSIDs are often with semantics; from which we can inferthe place where the user stayed. Second; a Wi-Fi log is produced when the user is near a Wi-Fi access point. A high frequency of a consecutively observed SSID implies a long stayduration at a place. To the best of our knowledge; our work is the first attempting tounderstand users from the collected Wi-Fi logs from mobile devices. However; Wi-Fi logs areessentially of various information types and with noises. How to assess the information …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,7
Dynamic skylines considering range queries,Wen-Chi Wang; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Dynamic skyline queries are practical in many applications. For example; if no dataexist to fully satisfy a query q in an information system; the data “closer” to the requirementsof q can be retrieved as answers. Finding the nearest neighbors of q can be a solution; yetfinding the data not dynamically dominated by any other data with respect to q; ie thedynamic skyline regarding q can be another solution. A data point p is defined todynamically dominate another data point s; if the distance between each dimension of p andthe corresponding dimension of q is no larger than the corresponding distance regarding sand q and at least in one dimension; the corresponding distance regarding p and q issmaller than that regarding s and q. Some approaches for answering dynamic skylinequeries have been proposed.

An efficient algorithm for near optimal data allocation on multiple broadcast channels,Chih-Hao Hsu; Guanling Lee; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In a wireless environment; the bandwidth of the channels and the energy of theportable devices are limited. Data broadcast has become an excellent method for efficientdata dissemination. In this paper; the problem for generating a broadcast program of a set ofdata items with the associated access frequencies on multiple channels is explored. In ourapproach; a minimal expected average access time of the broadcast data items is firstderived. The broadcast program is then generated; which minimizes the minimal expectedaverage access time.

Effective database transformation and efficient support computation for mining sequential patterns,Chung-Wen Cho; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we introduce a novel algorithm for mining sequential patterns fromtransaction databases. Since the FP-tree based approach is efficient in mining frequentitemsets; we adapt it to find frequent 1-sequences. For efficient frequent k-sequence mining;every frequent 1-sequence is encoded as a unique symbol and the database is transformedinto one in the symbolic form. We observe that it is unnecessary to encode all the frequent 1-seqences; and make full use of the discovered frequent 1-sequences to transform thedatabase into one with a smallest size. To discover the frequent k-sequences; we design atree structure to store the candidates. Each customer sequence is then scanned to decidewhether the candidates are frequent k-sequences. We propose a technique to avoidredundantly enumerating the identical k-subsequences from a customer sequence to …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,7
A mask matching approach for video segmentation on compressed data,Tony CT Kuo; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Video segmentation provides an easy and efficient way for video retrieval andbrowsing. A frame is detected as a shot change frame if its content is very different from itsprevious frames. The process of segmenting videos into shots is usually time consumingdue to the large number of frames in the videos. In this paper; we propose a new approachfor segmenting videos into shots on MPEG coded video data. This approach detects shotchanges by computing the shot change probability for each frame. The MPEG coded videodata are only partially decoded such that the time for decoding and processing video dataframe by frame and pixel by pixel can be avoided. A set of masks for different types of MPEGcoded frames (I; P; and B frames) is defined for the computation of the shot changeprobability. Experiments based on various parameters are performed to show a 95% of …,Information Sciences,2002,7
Content-based image retrieval by feature point matching,Chiou-Ting Hsu; Ya-Ting Wu; Arbee LP Chen,With the advance of multimedia technologies and the explosive expansion of the WorldWide Web; the volume of image and video data increases rapidly. An efficient and effectivemultimedia data retrieval technique is needed. In this paper; we propose an approach basedon feature points for the content-based image retrieval. The feature points extracted from themultiresolution representation of the query image and database image are first matched todetermine the matching pairs. Then; the marching pairs are classified into groups. Finally;two similarity measurements based on different similarity requirements are proposed tocompute the similarity degree. We perform a series of experiments to study thecharacteristics of this approach; and compare with the region-based approach on similar-shot sequence retrieval. The comparison shows the superiority of this approach.,Storage and Retrieval for Media Databases 2001,2001,7

Compared withtraditional keyword-based data retrieval; content-based retrieval provides a flexible andpowerful way to retrieve video data. We discuss three approaches in depth. First; since videosegmentation is an elementary task in video index construction; we discuss an approach todetect shot changes for video segmentation; which is based on the processing of MPEGcompressed video data. Second; since a video object consists of a sequence of frames; thetechniques for retrieving video objects based on the similarity of key frames are addressed.Third; we discuss a video query model and video query processing techniques based on …,Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China Part A Phys Sci Eng,1999,7

Approximate video search based on spatio-temporal information of video objects,Chia-Han Lin; Arbee LP Chen,The spatio-temporal information of a video object is important for content-based videoretrieval. In this paper; the spatio-temporal information of a video object; such as the velocity;location and orientation of a video object; is represented by an ST-string. Since the user maynot be interested in all spatio-temporal information; the user query can be represented by aQST-string which contains some spatio-temporal information only; such as the velocity andorientation of a video object. Therefore; the video retrieval problem can be transformed intothe problem of approximately matching a QST-string with ST-strings. A general solution isproposed in this paper; which includes a similarity measure; an index structure and thecorresponding matching methodology. The experiment results show that both theapproximate and exact results can be found efficiently via the proposed index structure …,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006.

Efficient image retrieval approaches for different similarity requirements,Chiou-Yann Tsai; Arbee LP Chen; Kai Essig,The amount of pictorial data grows enormously with the expansion of the WWW. From thelarge number of images; it is very important for users to retrieve desired images via anefficient and effective mechanism. In this paper we prose two efficient approaches tofacilitate image retrieval by using a simple method to represent the image content. Eachimage is partitioned into m X n equal-sized sub-images. A color that has enough number ofpixels in a block is extracted to represent its content. In the first approach; the image contentis represented by the extracted colors of the blocks. The spatial information of images isconsidered in image retrieval. In the second approach; the colors of the blocks in an imageare used to extract objects.

Partial values with probabilities are employed in a heterogeneousdatabase system to resolve schema and data con icts; and to provide a more informativequery answer. In this paper; we extend the de nition of the similarity function in Jaccard'ssimilarity coe cients to estimate the probabilities. This extension is based on ourcategorization of attribute semantics.

IMPROVING SEMI-JOIN PROGRAMS FOR DISTRIBUTED QUERY PROCESSING.,Arbee LP Chen; Victor OK Li,The problem of optimal query processing in distributed database systems was shown to beNP-hard. This means that heuristic algorithms are necessary to solve the query processingproblem. Algorithms are described to improve the solutions generated by heuristics. Fourproperties are identified which optimal semi-join programs for processing tree queries haveto satisfy. A semi-join program is represented by an execution graph which specifies theorder and the identities of the semi-joins to be executed. Given a semi-join program; we cantherefore apply these properties to check its optimality. If it does not satisfy these optimalityproperties; the associated improvement algorithms can be applied to improve this program.No assumptions have been made about the relation size and the selectivity of the semi-joins.,Proceedings-IEEE Computer Society's International Computer Software & Applications Conference,1984,6
MapReduce skyline query processing with partitioning and distributed dominance tests,Jia-Ling Koh; Chia-Ching Chen; Chih-Yu Chan; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; in order to efficiently process skyline queries by the MapReduceframework; two algorithms are proposed to prevent the bottleneck of centrally finding theglobal skyline from the local skylines. The proposed algorithms aim to reduce the number ofdominance tests; which check whether a data point is dominated by another data point; andperform the necessary dominance tests in parallel. The first algorithm uses a grid-based andan angle-based partitioning schemes to divide the data space into segments for finding thelocal skyline data points. Two sets of rules are designed respectively for the two partitioningmethods to reduce the number of dominance tests among the local skyline data points tofind the skyline data points. The second algorithm uses the skyline data points discoveredfrom sample data points to filter out most non-skyline data points in the mappers. For the …,Information Sciences,2017,5

Mining serial episode rules with time lags over multiple data streams,Tung-Ying Lee; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The problem of discovering episode rules from static databases has been studiedfor years due to its wide applications in prediction. In this paper; we make the first attempt tostudy a special episode rule; named serial episode rule with a time lag in an environment ofmultiple data streams. This rule can be widely used in different applications; such as trafficmonitoring over multiple car passing streams in highways. Mining serial episode rules overthe data stream environment is a challenge due to the high data arrival rates and the infinitelength of the data streams. In this paper; we propose two methods considering differentcriteria on space utilization and precision to solve the problem by using a prefix tree tosummarize the data streams and then traversing the prefix tree to generate the rules.

In this paper; we propose an approach to integrate database schemasinto a relational global view which consists of concept hierarchies. A concept hierarchy iscomposed of relation schemes with the same concept; to which specialization andgeneralization can be speci ed to enrich the semantics of the relational view. Based on theconcept hierarchies; a procedure is designed to decompose a global query to localsubqueries and a set of transformation rules are developed to transform a query into anequivalent one for query optimization.,COMAD,1994,5

Effective database transformation and efficient support computation for mining sequential patterns,Chung-Wen Cho; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm for mining frequent sequences fromtransaction databases. The transactions of the same customers form a set of customersequences. A sequence (an ordered list of itemsets) is frequent if the number of customersequences containing it satisfies the user-specified threshold. The 1-sequence is a specialtype of sequences because it consists of only a single itemset instead of an ordered list;while the k-sequence is a sequence composed of k itemsets. Compared with the cost ofmining frequent k-sequences (k≥ 2); the cost of mining frequent 1-sequences is negligible.We adopt a two-phase architecture to find the two types of frequent sequences separately inorder that the discovery of frequent k-sequences can be well designed and optimized.

Similarity search in transaction databases with a two-level bounding mechanism,Jo-Chun Chuang; Chung-Wen Cho; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel indexing method for similarity search intransaction databases where the frequency of database updates can be high. In our method;the incoming transactions are incrementally classified into clusters. The transactions in acluster are represented using two features; namely the union and the intersection of all thetransactions. Based on these two features; the transactions in a cluster are further dividedinto disjoint groups. As a result; all the transactions are organized as a two-level indexstructure. With this index; the insertion of a transaction can be quickly done because only aparticular cluster needs to be modified. Moreover; when conducting a similarity search; wecan compute for each level the lower and upper bounds on the distance between the queryand each transaction in the cluster. Based on these bounds; the costs on the distance …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,4

Partial Natural Outerjoin - An Operation for Interoperability in a Multidatabase Environment,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,Natural outerjoin has been considered as an important operation in schema integration. Itcan be used to define various views in cooperation with other operations. Due to theexistence of inconsistent data and null values in base relations of multiple databases; thetraditional natural outerjoin cannot be directly applied to schema integration in amultidatabase environment. In this paper; the effects of execution orders; inconsistent data;and null values on the resultant semantics of natural outerjoins are explored. Because anarbitrary execution order of natural outerjoins may cause the resultant semantics to beambiguous; care needs to be taken in specification of the execution order. We investigatehow to determine the execution order of natural outerjoins such that the result is desirable.Moreover; an extension of traditional natural outerjoin; called partial natural outerjoin; is …,J.

An efficient approach on content-based image retrieval with DCT coefficient indexes,Chia-Han Lin; Arbee LP Chen; Tony CT Kuo; Chiou-Yann Tsay,Abstract An image retrieval system is described in this paper. The index filter and similaritymatching methods based on DCT coefficients of JPEG images are proposed to retrievalsimilar images from a large image database. By directly using the compressed features;similar images can be efficiently found. The retrieval system includes an index structure; atwo-phase filter and similarity matching module. The index structure is constructed by usingthe difference vector of DC histograms. The twophase filter based on the index structure isused to prune irrelevant images. The image candidates obtained by the two-phase filter isfurther processed by the similarity matching module to find the similar images of the queryimage. The difference of two images is defined as the difference between their DC (AC)histograms.

Optimizing entity join queries when data transmission cost dominates,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Heterogeneities exist in a multidatabase environment. For example; a real worldentity may be differently represented in relations of different databases. In particular; keys ofthese relations may be incompatible. In this paper; we consider processing entity joinqueries when data transmission cost dominates. An entity join operation 'integrates' tuplesrepresenting the same entities from different relations in which inconsistent data may exist. Anatural way to process the entity join is to transmit both relations to a site; resolve thepossible conflicts between corresponding attributes and process the join; which is verycostly. In this paper; an approach is proposed to correctly transform a global query into localsubqueries to preprocess entity join queries in multiple sites with an attempt to lower the costof data transmission. Besides; an extension of the traditional semijoin; named extended …,Data & knowledge engineering,1997,4

Comments on" Area-time optimal adder design",Chien-In Henry Chen; Anup Kumar,A previous paper by Wei and Thompson (1990) defined a family of adders based on amodular design and presented an excellent systematic method of implementing a VLSIparallel adder using three types of component cells designed in static CMOS. Theirapproach to the adder design was based on the optimization of a formulated dynamicprogramming problem with respect to area and time. The authors first explicitly demonstratethe optimal 32-bit fast carry generator; described by Wei and Thompson; is incorrect. Withsuitable corrections; a correct 32-bit fast carry generator design is then presented. Next;BiCMOS technology is applied to implement the subcircuit of fast carry generator toaccelerate the critical path. The authors show that the critical path delay of 16-bit; 32-bit and66-bit adders is respectively shortened to 83.89%; 86.89% and 90.62% after introducing …,IEEE transactions on computers,1994,4
A Localized Approach to Query Optimization in Heterogeneous Database Systems,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Heterogeneities exist in multiple databases. For example; a real world entity may bedi erently represented in relations of di erent databases. In particular; keys of these relationsmay be incompatible. In this paper; we develop an entity join operator named EJ operator;which can be used to join two relations on their compatible/incompatible keys. By this join; ifan entity is represented in both relations; all its properties given in relations can be obtained.Besides; a neighborhood join operator named NJ operator is introduced; which joinsrelations allowing some degree of value uncertainty on the join attributes. The EJ operator;NJ operator and the previously proposed extended relational operators can be combined tosupport a more powerful set of operations on heterogeneous databases. Since the EJoperator" integrates" tuples from relations; whose attribute values may have con icts; a …,J. Inf. Sci. Eng.,1993,4
Generalizing the division operation on indefinite databases,Frank Shou-Cheng Tseng; Arbee LP Chen; Wei-Pang Yang,Abstract Uncertain data in databases were originally denoted as null values; whichrepresent the meaning of “values unknown at present”. Grant generalized null values intopartial values to provide a more powerful notion. In this paper; an important operation–division; is fully studied to handle partial values. Due to the uncertainties of partial values;the extended divisions may produce maybe tuples. To process this extended division; wedecompose a relation consisting of partial values into a set of relations containing onlydefinite values by employing the concepts of interpretation. Bipartite graph matchingtechniques are then applied to develop efficient algorithms for the extended division thathandles partial values. A refinement on the maybe result tuples of an extended division isalso discussed.,*,1992,4
Systems and methods for discovering frequently accessed subtrees,*,A method for discovering frequently accessed subtrees; performed by an electronicapparatus; comprises the following steps. A request is received from a source. A globalprefix tree (GPT) comprising multiple traversal paths is acquired; each traversal pathrepresenting one of a plurality of frequently accessed subtrees. A response comprising theGPT is transmitted to the source; thereby enabling the source to discover the frequentlyaccessed subtrees based on the GPT. The GPT is generated in response to multiple datastreams respectively comprising accessed nodes of a partially traversed theoretical tree.,*,2009,3
An approach to querying multiple object databases,Jia-Ling Koh; Arbee LP Chen,In a multidatabase system which consists of object databases; a global schema created byintegrating schemas of the component databases provides a uniform interface and highlevel location transparency to help users retrieve data. The mapping between the global andcomponent object schemas is complicated due to schema restructuring conducted to resolvevarious conflicts among component schemas before conducting schema integration. Thismapping information is important for global query processing. In this paper; a mappingstrategy is presented. A mapping equation is defined to denote the mappings for attributesand object instances between a virtual class and its constituent classes. In addition; amapping graph is used to describe the mapping equation. Based on the mappinginformation; a mechanism for processing global queries in parallel is introduced.

Voting intention and choices: Are voters always rational and deliberative?,I-Ching Lee; Eva E Chen; Chia-Hung Tsai; Nai-Shing Yen; Arbee LP Chen; Wei-Chieh Lin,Human rationality–the ability to behave in order to maximize the achievement of theirpresumed goals (ie; their optimal choices)–is the foundation for democracy. Researchevidence has suggested that voters may not make decisions after exhaustively processingrelevant information; instead; our decision-making capacity may be restricted by our ownbiases and the environment. In this paper; we investigate the extent to which humans in ademocratic society can be rational when making decisions in a serious; complex situation–voting in a local political election. We believe examining human rationality in a politicalelection is important; because a well-functioning democracy rests largely upon the rationalchoices of individual voters.

Monitoring heterogeneous nearest neighbors for moving objects considering location-independent attributes,Yu-Chi Su; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In some applications; data may possess both location-dependent and location-independent attributes. For example; in a job database; each job can be associated withboth location-dependent attributes; eg; the location of the work place; and location-independent ones; eg; the salary. A person who uses this database to find a job may prefernot only a shorter distance between his/her house and the work place but also a highersalary. Therefore; a query with both concepts of “shorter distance” and “higher salary” shouldbe considered to meet the user's needs. We call it the heterogeneous k-nearest neighbor(HkNN) query in distinction from the traditional k-nearest neighbor (kNN) query in the spatialdomain; which only concerns location-dependent attributes. To our knowledge; this paper isthe first work proposing a generic framework for solving the HkNN query. We propose an …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,2

Area-time optimal digital BiCMOS carry look-ahead adder,Chien-In Henry Chen; Anup Kumar,Previous research in VLSI adders has identified the existence of tradeoffs betweenasymptotic area and asymptotic time. This paper presents a systematic method ofimplementing a BiCMOS carry look-ahead adder design which is optimized with respect toarea and time. Since the adder circuits usually lie on the critical path delay of carry generatordue to large fan-out and output capacitances; speed determines the clock cycle time. In viewof the driving capability of bipolar transistors; the BiCMOS buffer/driver and BiCMOS cellsare chosen and modified to drive large fan-out or heavy capacitive loads. Combining thebipolar and CMOS circuits on a single chip; the performance of the carry generator circuit isimproved due to the acceleration of the critical path. A comparison between BiCMOS andCMOS parallel adders is made. It is shown that the parallel adders designed using the …,Circuits and Systems; 1994.

A sound and complete extended relational algebra for exclusive disjunctive data,Jui-Shang Chiu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we propose an extended relational model; named Pv-table; forrepresenting exclusive disjunctive data (ie; exactly one of the possible values is true) byassociating partial values and variables with attributes. While a partial value plays a role asa set of possible values of the represented data item; a variable serves as an identifier forthe true value of this data item. Identifiers can be used to determine the equirelationshipamong partial values. The relational operators are extended to manipulate Pv-tables. Weshow that the set-based query evaluation on Pv-tables is sound and complete for queriesconsisting of extended selection; union; intersection; Cartesian product and join.

Optimizing Multidatabase Queries by Query Transformation,Arbee LP Chen,In a multidatabase system; schemas of the component databases are usually integrated intoa global schema to provide users with transparencies on data distribution and schemadifferences. To process queries against the global schema; query modification; which mapsthe query into one against local schemas; is necessary. In this paper; an approach whichtransforms and decomposes the modified query into subqueries to optimize distributedquery processing is presented. Each subquery references data contained at a local site and;therefore; can be locally processed. The partial results produced from these subqueryexecutions are then collected to compute the query answer. This approach reduces queryresponse time due to parallel processing. Moreover; queries which can actually beprocessed at a single site can be identified.,J. Inf. Sci. Eng.,1991,2
Mining User Trajectories from Smartphone Data Considering Data Uncertainty,Yu Chi Chen; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Wi-Fi hot spots have quickly increased in recent years. Accordingly; discoveringuser positions by using Wi-Fi fingerprints has attracted much research attention. Wi-Fifingerprints are the sets of Wi-Fi scanning results recorded in mobile devices. However; theissue of data uncertainty is not considered in the proposed Wi-Fi positioning systems.

Verification of k-coverage on query line segments,Kun-Han Juang; En Tzu Wang; Chieh-Feng Chiang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract The coverage problem is one of the fundamental problems in sensor networks;which reflects the degree of a region being monitored by sensors. In this paper; we make thefirst attempt to address the k-coverage verification problem regarding a given query linesegment; which returns all sub-segments from the line segment that are covered by at least ksensors. To deal with the problem; we propose three methods based on the R-tree index.The first method is the most primitive one; which identifies all intersection points of the queryline segment and the circumferences of the covering regions of the sensors and then checkseach sub-segment to see whether it is k-coverage. Improving from the first method; thesecond method calculates the lower bound of the number of sensors covering a specific sub-segment to reduce the computation costs.

Identifying Prototypical Melodies by Extracting Approximate Repeating Patterns from Music Works,Ning-Han Liu; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,The concept of a prototypical melody has been proposed to characterize sets of similarmusical segments in a composition. In musicology; the degree of importance associated witha prototypical melody is proportional to the number of musical segments similar to it. In thispaper; a novel approach is developed to extract all the prototypical melodies in a musicalwork. Our approach considers each music segment as a prototypical melody candidate andutilizes edit distance to isolate a set of music segments that are similar to this candidate. Toexpedite the process; a lower bounding mechanism is used to estimate the number ofsimilar musical segments for each candidate to eliminate impossible options. Furthermore;the approach is extended to facilitate the extraction of all prototypical melodies in a set ofmusical works. Analysis is carried out on a real data set; and the results indicate …,Journal of Information Science and Engineering,2010,1

Energy-efficient sensor data acquisition based on periodic patterns,Guan-Rong Lin; Yao-Chung Fan; En Tzu Wang; Tao Zou; Arbee LP Chen,Wireless sensor networks have received considerable attention in recent years and playedan important role in data collection applications. Sensor nodes usually have limited supplyof energy. Therefore; a major consideration for developing sensor network applications is toconserve the energy for sensor nodes. In this paper; we propose a novel energy-efficientdata acquisition algorithm based on the periodic patterns derived from past sensor readings.Our key observation is that sensor readings often exhibit periodic patterns; eg; the dailycycle of temperature readings; and the patterns provide opportunities for reducing energyconsumption for sensor data acquisition. We exploit the patterns and use the patterns tobuild a statistic model for predicting sensor readings. In our approach; sensor dataacquisition is needed only when acquired readings are unpredictable.

A novel representation of sequence data based on structural information for effective music retrieval,Chia-Hsiung Lee; Chung-Wen Cho; Yi-Hung Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel representation of sequences based on thestructural information of the sequences.

One iscalled frequent pattern; which is a subsequence appearing often enough in the sequence.The other is called correlative pattern; which is a subsequence composed of highlycorrelated elements. The rules derived from the frequent patterns are called frequent rules;while the ones derived from the correlative patterns are called correlative rules.

Content-based query processing and approximation for video databases,TCT Kuo; ALP Chen,This paper presents a query processing strategy for the content-based video querylanguage named CVQL. By CVQL; users can flexibly specify query predicates by the spatialand temporal relationships of the content objects. The query processing strategy evaluatesthe predicates and returns qualified videos or frames as results. Before the evaluation of thepredicates; a preprocessing is performed to avoid unnecessary accessing of videos whichare impossible to be the answers. The preprocessing checks the existence of the contentobjects specified in the predicates to eliminate unqualified videos. For the evaluation of thepredicates; an M-index is designed based on the analysis of the behaviors of the contentobjects. The M-index is employed to avoid frame-by-frame evaluation of the predicates.Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of this approach,Proc.

Manipulation of exclusive disjunctive data in relational databases,Jui-Shang Chiu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we propose an extended relational model; named Pv-table; forrepresenting exclusive disjunctive data (ie; there exists a set of possible values for a dataitem; and exactly one of the possible values is true) by associating partial values andvariables with attributes. While a partial value denotes the set of possible values; a variableserves as an identifier for the true value of the data item. Identifiers can be used to determinethe equi-relationship among partial values. The relational operators are extended tomanipulate Pv-tables. We show that the set-based query evaluation on Pv-tables is soundand complete for queries consisting of extended selection; union; intersection; Cartesianproduct and join. We also show that useful algebraic properties are preserved in our model.A disjunctive (resp. conjunctive) query can be replaced by the extended union (resp …,Data & knowledge engineering,1997,1
A New Relation Partitioning Scheme for Distriibuted Query Optimization.,Wen-Fang Wang; Arbee LP Chen,The" fragment and replicate" strategy has been used to process distributed queries. One ofthe relations referenced in a query is horizontally partitioned into fragments and distributedto a set of processing sites. After other relations are replicated at these sites; the query isprocessed in parallel. The query answer is the union of the results produced at eachprocessing site. To process a query; we have to determine which relation to partition; how topartition this relation; and which sites will be the processing sites. In this paper; we extendthis strategy by considering replication of portions of the relations instead of the entirerelations to improve system performance. Based on the characteristics of semijoin; the min-max method and a hash-based method are designed to partition relations.

An entity joinoperation" integrates" tuples representing the same entities from different relations in whichinconsistent data may exist. The semijoin technique has been successfully used in adistributed database system to reduce the cost of data transmission. However; it cannot bedirectly applied to process the entity join query.

Improving execution concurrency for long-duration database transactions,Alex NJ Wu; Arbee LP Chen,The paper presents an approach for processing long-duration database transactions withhigh concurrency degree. The basic idea is based on the use of a repository which storesthe data items that can be exposed before the associated transaction commits. Themanagement of the repository is described. Since we allow a transaction to read and updatethe early exposed data items; if the data items are invalidated we have to rollback thetransactions that have read these data items. In order to reduce the cost of rollback; a partialrollback mechanism is proposed. Further; transactions that have read the early exposeddata may commit earlier than the corresponding uncommitted transactions. We describe thecommit decision rule to determine whether earlier commitment can be allowed; by which thesystem throughput can be increased.,Computer Software and Applications Conference; 1994.

In this paper; weconsider a novel problem of finding the shortest path which satisfies the user requirementsrepresented as a set of points of interest such as a restaurant or post office. Two approachesare proposed to deal with this problem. The basic approach solves the problem using thedepth first search (DFS) algorithm. The advanced approach reduces the search space of thepaths by pruning strategies. The experiment results show that the advanced approachdemonstrates a great performance in terms of the execution time.,Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Data Mining; Communications and Information Technology,2017,*
Mining Event Sequences from Social Media for Election Prediction,Kuan-Chieh Tung; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Predicting election results is a challenging task for big data analytics. Simpleapproaches count the number of tweets mentioning candidates or parties to do theprediction. In fact; many other factors may cause the candidates to win or lose in an election;such as their political opinions; social issues; and scandals. In this paper; we mine rules ofevent sequences from social media to predict election results. An example rule for acandidate can be as follows:“(big event; positive)→(small event; negative)→(big event;positive)” implies a victory to this candidate. We detect events and decide event types togenerate event sequences and then apply the rule-based classifier to build the predictionmodel. A series of experiments are performed to evaluate our approaches and theexperiment results reveal that the accuracy of our approaches on predicting election …,Industrial Conference on Data Mining,2016,*
Is Time Series Smoothing Function Necessary for Crop Mapping?—Evidence from Spectral Angle Mapper After Empirical Analysis,Ailian Chen; Hu Zhao; Zhiyuan Pei,Abstract Time series smoothing functions have been frequently applied to fit multi-temporalvegetation index for better extraction of plant seasonal/growing parameters.

On Continuous Spatial Skyline Queries over a Line Segment,Wei Heng Tai; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Traditional skyline queries consider data points with static attributes; eg; thedistance to a beach of a hotel. However; some attributes considered for a skyline query canbe dynamic; eg; the distance to a beach of a moving vehicle. Consider a scenario as follows.A person in a moving vehicle issues a skyline query to find restaurants; taking into accountthe static attributes of the restaurants as well as the distance to them. This scenario motivesus to address a novel skyline query considering both static and dynamic attributes of datapoints. Given a data set D (eg; restaurants) with a set of static attributes in a two-dimensionalspace; a query line segment l (eg; the route for driving); and a distance constraint of r (forchoosing a restaurant); we want to find out the skylines along l considering the static anddynamic attributes of the data points; satisfying the location constraint of r.

Finding Leaders with Maximum Spread of Influence through Social Networks,Tsung An Yeh; En Tzu Wang; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Social influence is an important phenomenon in social networks. A user is said tobe influenced by his/her friends if this user performs the same actions after his/her friends.The problem of influence maximization is to find a small set of users that maximize thespread of influence throughout the social network. Many approaches are proposed to solvethis problem under different influence cascade models. In this paper; we propose anothersolution based on a pruning strategy in which influence boundaries for users are computedto effectively reduce the number of users who have chances to be seeds; thus making theproposed solution efficient. A series of experiments are performed to evaluate the proposedapproach and the experiment results reveal that our approach outperforms the previousworks.,*,2013,*

An Approximation Algorithm for Optimizing Multiple Path Tracking Queries over Sensor Data Streams,Yao-Chung Fan; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Sensor networks have received considerable attention in recent years and playedan important role in data collection applications. Sensor nodes have limited supply ofenergy. Therefore; one of the major design considerations for sensor applications is toreduce the power consumption. In this paper; we study an application that combines RFIDand sensor network technologies to provide an environment for moving object path tracking;which needs efficient join processing. This paper considers multi-query optimization toreduce query evaluation cost; and therefore power consumption. We formulate the multi-query optimization problem and present a novel approximation algorithm which providessolutions with suboptimal guarantees. In addition; extensive experiments are made todemonstrate the performance of the proposed optimization strategy.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2009,*

Maintaining moving sums over data streams,Tzu-Chiang Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Given a data stream of numerical data elements generated from multiple sources;we consider the problem of maintaining the sum of the elements for each data source over asliding window of the data stream. The difficulties of the problem come from two parts. One isthe number of data sources and the other is the number of elements in the sliding window.For massive data sources; we need a significant number of counters to maintain the sum foreach data source; while for a large number of data elements in the sliding window; we needa huge space to keep all of them. We propose two methods; which shares the countersefficiently and merge the data elements systematically so that we are able to estimate thesums using a concise data structure. Two parameters; ε and δ; are needed to construct thedata structure. ε controls the bounds of the estimate and δ represents the confidence level …,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2006,*

A Graph-based Approach to Mining Inter-transaction Association Rules,AHC Lee; ECH Lin; ALP Chen,With the growing interest in commercial trend analysis; mining association rules in largedatabases has been an important topic in data mining field. Mining inter-transactionassociation rules creates new challenges since it involves data items in multipletransactions. In this paper; we study the problems of mining various patterns from largedatabases and classify them into three types. Moreover; we show the relationships betweenthese problems and illustrate how to transform one into another. After that; we propose agraph-based approach to discover large inter-transaction itemsets. The proposed approachis good at finding the large inter-transaction k-itemsets for a specific value of k and themaximal large inter-transaction itemsets.

A Methodology for Schema Integration Using Concept Hierarchies,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Since relational DBMSs are wide-spread; providing a relational global view forusers who are only familiar with the relational model to access data in a multidatabasesystem is significant. However; the prior work on schema integration can not efficientlycapture the relationships among relations from different databases. In this paper; wepropose an approach to integrate database schemas into a relational global view whichconsists of concept hierarchies. A concept hierarchy is composed of relation schemes withthe same concept; in which specialization and generalization can be specified to enrich thesemantics of the relational view. Based on the concept hierarchies; a procedure is designedto decompose a global query to local subqueries and a set of transformation rules isdeveloped to transform a query into an equivalent one for query optimization.,Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering,1999,*

We propose a region-based location strategy by takingadvantage of the user's movement behavior to improve the performance of the conventionalsystems. Each mobile user is associated with a set of regions; which are derived from theuser's movement patterns. The registration processes in the same region can be eliminatedsuch that the cost of location management can be significantly reduced. Several designissues are studied by considering the workload balance and the call-to-mobility ratio for auser. The proposed strategy can be dynamically adjusted based on different systemparameters and user behavior.

It refers to the environment where tens of millionsof users will use various palmtop and laptop computers; connected by wireless connectionsto the fixed network. In this paper; we focus on deriving the condition of data replication. Themain goal of data replication is to reduce the network traffic generated by massive queriesand to speed up the query processing. We try to make it possible to get the needed datafrom the local agents to process the queries. Further; we present eight query processingstrategies; simulate their behaviors according to five query types and other factors of thewireless environment; and discuss the simulation results.,Proceedings of the IPSJ International Symposium on Information Systems and Technologies for Network Society,1997,*

In this paper;we propose an approach to multidatabase resource discovery which identifies relevantrelations from autonomous component databases. A tool is developed to guide the localdatabase administrator to specify the relation semantics. The specification can beconsidered as the metadata of the relation. By our approach; the metadata of a relation isrepresented as an object in a class and objects that are relevant and stored in the sameclass/class hierarchy. The schema integrator and users can specify resource queries toobtain the metadata of relevant relations satisfying the requirements.

Schema Integration and Query Processing of Object-Oriented Multidatabase Systems,JL Koh; ALP Chen,In a multiple database system; a global schema created by integrating schemas of thecomponent databases provides a uniform interface and high level location transparency forthe users to retrieve data. The main problem for constructing a global schema is to resolveconflicts among component schemas. In this paper; we define corresponding assertions forthe database administrators to specify the semantic correspondences among componentobject schemas. Based on these assertions; integration rules are designed; which use a setof primitive integration operators to restructure the component schemas for resolving theconflicts and do the integration. The principle of our integration strategy is to keep the data ofcomponent databases retrievable from the global schema without losing information.Moreover; more informative query answers may be derived from the multiple databases …,Proc. 7th Workshop on Object-Oriented Technology and Applications,1996,*

Entity Join Optimization in Mutidatabase Systems.,Pauray SM Tsai; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Heterogeneities exist in a multidatabase environment. For example; a real worldentity may be di erently represented in relations of di erent databases. In particular; keys ofthese relations may be incompatible. In this paper; we develop an entity join operator namedEJ operator; which can be used to join two relations on their compatible/incompatible keys.By this join; if an entity is represented in both relations; all its properties given in relationscan be obtained. Besides; a neighborhood join operator named NJ operator is introduced;which joins relations allowing some degree of value uncertainty on the join attributes. TheEJ operator; NJ operator and the previously proposed extended relational operators can becombined to support a more powerful set of operations for a multidatabase system.

A Data Cleaning Framework for Enabling User Preference Profiling through Wi-Fi Logs,Yao-Chung Fan; Yu-Chi Chen; Kuan-Chieh Tung; Kuo-Chen Wu; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract—Nowadays mobile devices have become a ubiquitous medium supporting variousforms of functionality and are widely accepted for commons. In this study; we investigateusing Wi-Fi logs from a mobile device to discover user preferences. The core ideas are twofolds. First; every Wi-Fi access point is with a network name; normally a human-readablestring; called SSID (Service Set Identifier). Since SSIDs are often with semantics; from whichwe can infer the place where the user stayed. Second; a Wi-Fi log is produced when theuser is near a Wi-Fi access point. A high frequency of a consecutively observed SSIDimplies a long stay duration at a place. To the best of our knowledge; our work is the firstattempting to understand users from the collected Wi-Fi logs from mobile devices. However;Wi-Fi logs are essentially of various information types and with noises. How to assess the …,*,*,*
Optimizing Multiple Join-Queries over Sensor Data Streams,Yao-Chung Fan; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Sensor networks have received considerable attentions in recent years and playedan important role in data collection applications. Sensor nodes have limited supply ofenergy. Therefore; one of the major design considerations for sensor applications is toreduce the power consumption. In this paper; we study an application that combines RFIDand sensor network technologies to provide an environment for path tracking; which needsefficient join-query processing. In addition to individual query optimization; we consider multi-query optimizations to reduce query evaluation cost; and therefore power consumption. Wepresent algorithms for efficiently processing multiple join-queries with common evaluations.Moreover; extensive experiments are made to demonstrate the performance of the proposedoptimization techniques.,*,*,*

O~ WvIlZlNG STAR QUERIES IN A DISTRIBUTED DATABASE SYSTEM’,Arbee LP Chen; Victor OK Li,ABSTRACT The problem of optimal query processing in distributed database systems wasshown to be NP-hard. However; for a special type of queries called star queries; we havedeveloped a polynomial optimal algorithm. In an earlier paper; we described an approach toobtain the optimal semi-join program for a star query by gradually reducing the search spaceto a minimal set S without making any assumptions on the file sizes and the semi-joinselectivities. In this paper; by making certain assumptions on the file sizes and the semi-joinselectivities; the size of S can be reduced to unity; ie; given a star query; we can directlygenerate the optimal program. Our assumption on selectivitres IS consrstent in the sensethat we consider the selectivity of a semi-join based on the current database state; ie; wetake into consideration the reduction effects of all prior semi-joins. We have also included …,*,*,*

Tech. Report,CW Cho; Y Zheng; ALP Chen,Abstract. Event prediction over event streams is an important problem with broadapplications. For this problem; rules with predicate events and consequent events are given;and then current events are matched with the predicate events to predict future events. Overthe event stream; some matches of predicate events may trigger duplicate predictions; andan effective scheme is proposed to avoid such redundancies. Based on the scheme; wepropose a novel approach CBS-Tree to efficiently match the predicate events over eventstreams. The CBS-Tree approach maintains the recently arrived events as a tree structure;and an efficient algorithm is proposed for the matching of predicate events on the treestructure; which avoids exhaustive scans of the arrived events. By running a series ofexperiments; we show that our approach is more efficient than the previous work for most …,*,*,*
A Qualitative Comparison (Comparative Study) of Various Techniques for Content-based Music Information Retrieval,Jia-Lien Hsu; Arbee LP Chen,ABSTRACT In this article; we discuss the techniques used in content-based musicinformation retrieval. The techniques include the methods to represent music objects; thesimilarity measures of music objects; and indexing and query processing for music objectretrieval. To represent music objects; we introduce three coding schemes; ie; chord; mubol;and music segment. Various similarity measures are then presented; followed by variousindex structures and the associated query processing algorithms. The index structuresinclude suffix tree; n-gram; and augmented suffix tree. A qualitative comparison of thesetechniques is finally presented to show the intrinsic difficulty of the problem of content-basedmusic information retrieval. In addition; the platform for evaluating MIR approaches isintroduced. Some preliminary results of efficiency study are illustrated.,*,*,*

An E cient Data Mining Technique for Discovering Interesting Association Rules,Show-Jane Yen; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract Mining association rules is an important task. Past transaction data can be analyzedto discover customer purchasing behaviors such that the quality of business decision can beimproved. The association rules describe the associations among items in the largedatabase of customer transactions. However; the size of the database can be very large. It isvery time consuming to find all the association rules from a large database; and users maybe only interested in the associations among some items. Moreover; the criteria of thediscovered rules for the user requirements may not be the same. Many uninterestingassociation rules for the user requirements can be generated when traditional miningmethods are applied. Hence; a data mining language needs to be provided such that userscan query only interesting knowledge to them from a large database of customer …,*,*,*

Large Databases,Show-Jane Yen; Arbee LP Chen,Abstract In this paper; we study two problems: mining association rules and miningsequential patterns in a large database of customer transactions. The problem of miningassociation rules focuses on discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group ofitems which appear together in a suﬁicient number of transactions; While the problem ofmining sequential patterns focuses on discovering large sequences where a largesequence is an ordered list of sets of items which appear in a sufficient number oftransactions. We present efficient graph-based algorithms to solve these problems. Thealgorithms construct an association graph to indicate the associations between items andthen traverse the graph to generate large itemsets and large sequences; respectively. Ouralgorithms need to scan the database only once. Empirical evaluations show that our …,*,*,*

First; we describe features used to model the content of image;video and music data. Based on the object model; we propose a multimedia framework andan object-level spatial/temporal model to represent the spatial/temporal relationshipsbetween media objects. Three new types of aggregation relationships composed of thecomposition; temporal; and spatial relationships are considered in the framework. Tosupport content-based retrieval; we propose a multimedia query language and two kinds ofquery interfaces for users to specify content-based queries. Finally; two kinds of multimediaquery processing techniques are addressed.,*,*,*
