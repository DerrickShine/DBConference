Kernels for small molecules and the prediction of mutagenicity; toxicity and anti-cancer activity,S Joshua Swamidass; Jonathan Chen; Jocelyne Bruand; Peter Phung; Liva Ralaivola; Pierre Baldi,Abstract Motivation: Small molecules play a fundamental role in organic chemistry andbiology. They can be used to probe biological systems and to discover new drugs and otheruseful compounds. As increasing numbers of large datasets of small molecules becomeavailable; it is necessary to develop computational methods that can deal with molecules ofvariable size and structure and predict their physical; chemical and biological properties.Results: Here we develop several new classes of kernels for small molecules using their 1D;2D and 3D representations. In 1D; we consider string kernels based on SMILES strings. In2D; we introduce several similarity kernels based on conventional or generalizedfingerprints. Generalized fingerprints are derived by counting in different ways subpathscontained in the graph of bonds; using depth-first searches. In 3D; we consider similarity …,Bioinformatics,2005,173

Learning to predict chemical reactions,Matthew A Kayala; Chloé-Agathe Azencott; Jonathan H Chen; Pierre Baldi,Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the theory andapplications of organic chemistry. Approaches to the reaction prediction problems can beorganized around three poles corresponding to:(1) physical laws;(2) rule-based expertsystems; and (3) inductive machine learning. Previous approaches at these poles;respectively; are not high throughput; are not generalizable or scalable; and lack sufficientdata and structure to be implemented. We propose a new approach to reaction predictionutilizing elements from each pole. Using a physically inspired conceptualization; wedescribe single mechanistic reactions as interactions between coarse approximations ofmolecular orbitals (MOs) and use topological and physicochemical attributes as descriptors.Using an existing rule-based system (Reaction Explorer); we derive a restricted chemistry …,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2011,65

Automated physician order recommendations and outcome predictions by data-mining electronic medical records,Jonathan H Chen; Russ B Altman,Abstract The meaningful use of electronic medical records (EMR) will come from effectiveclinical decision support (CDS) applied to physician orders; the concrete manifestation ofclinical decision making. CDS development is currently limited by a top-down approach;requiring manual production and limited end-user awareness. A statistical data-miningalternative automatically extracts expertise as association statistics from structured EMRdata (> 5.4 M data elements from> 19K inpatient encounters). This powers an orderrecommendation system analogous to commercial systems (eg; Amazon. com's “Customerswho bought this…”). Compared to a standard benchmark; the association method improvesorder prediction precision from 26% to 37%(p< 0.01). Introducing an inverse frequencyweighted recall metric demonstrates a quantifiable improvement from 3% to 17%(p< 0.01) …,AMIA Summits on Translational Science proceedings,2014,12
