Visualizing multi-dimensional clusters; trends; and outliers using star coordinates,Eser Kandogan,Abstract Interactive visualizations are effective tools in mining scientific; engineering; andbusiness data to support decision-making activities. Star Coordinates is proposed as a newmulti-dimensional visualization technique; which supports various interactions to stimulatevisual thinking in early stages of knowledge discovery process. In Star Coordinates;coordinate axes are arranged on a two-dimensional surface; where each axis shares thesame origin point. Each multi-dimensional data element is represented by a point; whereeach attribute of the data contributes to its location through uniform encoding. Interactionfeatures of Star Coordinates provide users the ability to apply various transformationsdynamically; integrate and separate dimensions; analyze correlations of multipledimensions; view clusters; trends; and outliers in the distribution of data; and query points …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2001,314
Field studies of computer system administrators: analysis of system management tools and practices,Rob Barrett; Eser Kandogan; Paul P Maglio; Eben M Haber; Leila A Takayama; Madhu Prabaker,Abstract Computer system administrators are the unsung heroes of the information age;working behind the scenes to configure; maintain; and troubleshoot the computerinfrastructure that underlies much of modern life. However; little can be found in the literatureabout the practices and problems of these highly specialized computer users. We conducteda series of field studies in large corporate data centers; observing organizations; workpractices; tools; and problem-solving strategies of system administrators. We found systemadministrators operate within large-scale; complex environments that present significanttechnical; social; cognitive; and business challenges. In this paper; we describe systemadministrator tool use in critical; high-cost; labor-intensive work through observational;survey; and interview data.

Star coordinates: A multi-dimensional visualization technique with uniform treatment of dimensions,Eser Kandogan,Abstract Visualizing multi-dimensional data has tremendous effects on science; engineering;and business decisionmaking. A new visualization technique called Star Coordinates ispresented to support users in early stages of their visual thinking activities. Star Coordinatesarranges coordinates on a circle sharing the same origin at the center. It uses simply pointsto represent data; treating each dimension uniformly at the cost of coarse representation.Current implementation of Star Coordinates provided valuable insight on several real datasets for cluster discovery and multifactor analysis tasks. The work on Star Coordinates willcontinue on developing advanced transformations that will improve data understanding inmulti-dimensions.,Proceedings of the IEEE Information Visualization Symposium,2000,199
Elastic Windows: evaluation of multi-window operations,Eser Kandogan; Ben Shneiderman,ABSTRACT Most windowing systems follow the independent overlapping windowsapproach; which emerged as an answer to the needs of the 1980s' technology.

Koala: capture; share; automate; personalize business processes on the web,Greg Little; Tessa A Lau; Allen Cypher; James Lin; Eben M Haber; Eser Kandogan,Abstract We present Koala; a system that enables users to capture; share; automate; andpersonalize business processes on the web. Koala is a collaborative programming-by-demonstration system that records; edits; and plays back user interactions as pseudo-natural language scripts that are both human-and machine-interpretable. Unlike previousprogramming by demonstration systems; Koala leverages sloppy programming thatinterprets pseudo-natural language instructions (as opposed to formal syntactic statements)in the context of a given web page's elements and actions. Koala scripts are automaticallystored in the Koalescence wiki; where a community of users can share; run; andcollaboratively develop their" how-to" knowledge. Koala also takes advantage of corporateand personal data stores to automatically generalize and instantiate user-specific data; so …,Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems,2007,177
Avatar semantic search: a database approach to information retrieval,Eser Kandogan; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Sriram Raghavan; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan; Huaiyu Zhu,Abstract We present Avatar Semantic Search; a prototype search engine that exploitsannotations in the context of classical keyword search. The process of annotations isaccomplished offline by using high-precision information extraction techniques to extractfacts; con-cepts; and relationships from text. These facts and concepts are represented andindexed in a structured data store. At runtime; keyword queries are interpreted in the contextof these extracted facts and converted into one or more precise queries over the structuredstore. In this demonstration we describe the overall architecture of the Avatar SemanticSearch engine. We also demonstrate the superiority of the AVATAR approach overtraditional keyword search engines using Enron email data set and a blog corpus.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,95

Based on these changes and the problems of currentwindowing appraoches; we have updated the requirements for multiwindow systems toguide new methods of window management. We propose elastic windows with improvedspatial layout and rapid multi-window operations. Multi-window operations are achieved byissuing operations on window groups hierachically organized in a space-filling tiled layout.Sophisticated multi-window operations and spatial layout dynamics helps users to handlefast task-switching and to structure thier work environment to their rapidly changing needs …,Proceedings of the workshop on Advanced visual interfaces,1996,81
Usable autonomic computing systems: the administrator's perspective,Rob Barrett; Paul P Maglio; Eser Kandogan; John Bailey,One of the primary motivations behind autonomic computing (AC) is the problem ofadministrating highly complex systems. AC seeks to solve this problem through increasedautomation; relieving system administrators of many burdensome activities. However; theAC strategy of managing complexity through automation runs the risk of makingmanagement harder. We performed field studies of current administrator work practices toinform the design of AC in order to ensure that it simplifies system management. In thispaper; we analyze what system administrators do in terms of three important activities:rehearsal and planning; maintaining situation awareness; and managing multitasking;interruptions and diversions. We provide guidelines for constructing AC environments thatsupport these activities.,Autonomic Computing; 2004. Proceedings. International Conference on,2004,68

Elastic Windows: a hierarchical multi-window World-Wide Web browser,Eser Kandogan; Ben Shneiderman,ABSTRACT The World-Wide Web is becoming an invaluable source for the informationneeds of many users. However; current browsers are still primitive; in that they do notsupport many of the navigation needs of users; as indicated by user studies. They do notprovide an overview and a sense of location in the information structure being browsed. Alsothey do not facilitate organization and filtering of information nor aid users in accessingalready visited pages without high cognitive demands. In this paper; a new browsinginterface is proposed with multiple hierarchical windows and efficient multiple windowoperations. It provides a flexible environment where users can quickly organize; filter; andrestructure the information on the screen as they reformulate their goals.

A1: end-user programming for web-based system administration,Eser Kandogan; Eben Haber; Rob Barrett; Allen Cypher; Paul Maglio; Haixia Zhao,Abstract System administrators work with many different tools to manage and fix complexhardware and software infrastructure in a rapidly paced work environment. Throughextensive field studies; we observed that they often build and share custom tools for specifictasks that are not supported by vendor tools. Recent trends toward web-based managementconsoles offer many advantages but put an extra burden on system administrators; ascustomization requires web programming; which is beyond the skills of many systemadministrators. To meet their needs; we developed A1; a spreadsheet-based environmentwith a task-specific system-administration language for quickly creating small tools ormigrating existing scripts to run as web portlets.

Activity-based management of IT service delivery,John Bailey; Eser Kandogan; Eben Haber; Paul P Maglio,Abstract Growth; adaptability; innovation; and cost control are leading concerns ofbusinesses; especially with respect to use of information technology (IT). Though standardssuch as the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) offer the potential for costsavings through the use of formal processes and best practices; such top-down approachestend to be either highlevel-often far removed from the actual work-or low-level-ofteninflexible given the rapid pace of technology and market change. We conducted field studiesto examine work practices in IT service delivery. Our results suggest that unstructured workactivities comprise a significant and vital portion of the overall work done by people in ITservice delivery. These activities include negotiating work items and schedules; seeking andproviding information and expertise; and using and sharing custom tools and practices …,Proceedings of the 2007 symposium on Computer human interaction for the management of information technology,2007,26
Trust as an underlying factor of system administrator interface choice,Leila Takayama; Eser Kandogan,Abstract System administrators are the unsung heroes of the information age; workingbehind the scenes to configure; maintain; and troubleshoot the computer infrastructure thatunderlies much of modern life. While Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are being offered assystem administration tools; they mostly continue to use Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs).Based on an extensive survey of system administrators; we provide insights regarding thispreference; analyze why many of these power users perceive CLIs as more effective thanGUIs; and discuss findings as supported by observations from our parallel field studies. Ouranalysis indicates that cognition-based trust and monitoring play major roles in the interfacepreference for CLIs vs. GUIs. We also propose next steps for further exploration of trust inhuman-computer interfaces.,CHI'06 extended abstracts on Human factors in computing systems,2006,24

In this paper wedescribe how we've learned about IT work; using a variety of methods including naturalisticobservations; contextual interviews; surveys; and diary studies. We provide examples of ourstudy results; showing what we've learned with the different methods. We argue that toeffectively study such systems; a variety of methods may be needed to complement insightsand validate findings. We found that naturalistic observations were extremely time and laborintensive; yet offered us the time and space to observe unplanned events and long-lastingtasks; bringing out the full complexity and risks involved in real work.

Distributed Cognition and Joint Activity in Computer System Administration,Paul P Maglio; Eser Kandogan; Eben Haber,Abstract Troubleshooting large computer systems is often highly collaborative. Becausethese systems consist of complex infrastructures with many interdependent components;expertise is spread across people and organizations. Those who administer such systemsare faced with cognitive and social challenges; including the establishment of commonground and coordination of attention; as they troubleshoot in collaboration with peers;technical support; and software application developers. To investigate these aspects ofadministration work; we take a distributed cognition approach to interpreting a specificinstance of problem-solving in administering a Web-based system; examining the movementof representational states across media in a single system administrator's environment. Wealso apply the idea of language use as a joint activity to understand how discourse …,*,2008,6

Elastic windows: design; implementation; and evaluation of multi‐window operations,Eser Kandogan; Ben Shneiderman,Abstract Most windowing systems follow the independent overlapping windows approach;which emerged as an answer to the needs of early computer users. Due to advances incomputers; display technology; and increased information needs; modern users demandmore functionality from window management systems. We propose Elastic Windows withimproved spatial layout and rapid multi-window operations as an alternative to currentwindow management strategies. In this approach; multi-window operations are achieved byissuing operations on window groups hierarchically organized in a space-filling tiled layoutsimilar to TreeMaps. 1 Sophisticated multi-window operations have been developed tohandle fast task-switching and to structure the work environment of users to their rapidlychanging needs. We claim that these multi-window operations and the tiled spatial layout …,Software: Practice and Experience,1998,6
Policity: an experimental evaluation of policy-based administration in a city simulation,Christopher S Campbell; Eser Kandogan; Adam November; Rob Barrett; Paul P Maglio,The administration cost of today's complex IT systems is a major inhibitor of growth for manycompanies in the burgeoning services economy. One proposed solution is policy-basedsystem administration-a type of autonomic computing system that can manage itself withminimum human intervention. To explore the cost-benefit tradeoffs of policy-based systemadministration; we conducted an experiment in which participants managed a simulated city(Policity) using either a policy-based interface or a manual GUI-based interface. Resultsshowed that for novices; performance was 50% higher using the policy interface comparedto using the manual interface; but the interaction workload was significantly higher with thepolicy interface than with the manual interface. Overall; our results suggest that policy-basedsystem administration can provide substantial productivity improvement at the cost of …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2005.

Scalability in system management GUIs: a designer's nightmare,Andreas Dieberger; Eser Kandogan; Cheryl A Kieliszewski,Abstract As Information Technology (IT) advances; traditional concerns over performanceare being overtaken by concerns over manageability and scalability in system managementinterfaces [1]. Designing effective interactions and representations of large complex systemswith intricate relationships among components is a formidable challenge. In this paper wedescribe the design of a topology viewer application for enterprise-scale storage systems. Akey issue in this design effort was to create a graphical topology viewer that would scale tothe complexity of typical storage environments and support administrators effectively invarious activities. Our approach to address these issues was to use semantic zooming andprogressive information disclosure techniques extensively; thus essentially shifting thescalability challenge from purely visual design to mostly interaction design.,CHI'06 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2006,3
On the need for negotiation in policy-based interaction with autonomic computing systems,Paul P Maglio; Christopher S Campbell; Eser Kandogan,Large organizations develop guidelines; processes; and tools to help them implement andmanage IT. In many cases; these encode policies; the central means of control for autonomiccomputing systems. Policies consist of goals; scope; constraints; and tradeoffs in systemmanagement; and define the boundaries of delegation of work between people andsystems. Yet little is known about policy-based interaction among people and betweenpeople and systems. Are policies created once and used routinely over long periods? Or dopolicies change frequently? How do policies work in the real world? Our field observationssuggest that policies are continually negotiated and re-interpreted as they are applied tospecific instances. This implies several design points; including the need to make policyapplication transparent and flexible; enabling lightweight; rapid; incremental; and …,Autonomic Computing; 2005. ICAC 2005.

VIQS: Visual Interactive Exploration of Query Semantics,Christina Christodoulakis; Eser Kandogan; Ignacio G Terrizzano; Renée J Miller,Abstract Analytics platforms such as IBM's Watson Analytics TM are collecting metadataabout their use; including user queries on uploaded datasets. The analysis of this metadatamay be valuable in improving services; such as query recommendation and automatic datavisualization. However; analysis of metadata is difficult not only in terms of scale but also interms of complexity. Generalizing and exploring query patterns across users and datasets ischallenging. Abstractions are likely to help bridge differences in specifics (eg; column namesand query details); particularly in semantics. For example; a single query;" What is the trendof sales over year?" could be abstracted in many different ways (eg;" What is the trend offinancial gain over time?"). In this paper; we describe our process of creating a dataset ofquery semantics; starting from initial metadata extraction from query logs to semantic …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Workshop on Exploratory Search and Interactive Data Analytics,2017,1

Trust as an Underlying Factor of System Administrators’ Interaction Style Preferences,Leila Takayama; Eser Kandogan,ABSTRACT Sysadmins are the unsung heroes of the information age; working behind thescenes to configure; maintain; and troubleshoot the computer infrastructure that underliesmuch of modern life. While GUIs are being offered for system administrators; they mostlycontinue to use CLIs. Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are typically the interface of choicefor most sysadmin tasks; with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) occasionally used undersome situations. In this paper we provide insight for this preference based on an extensivesurvey; analyze why these power users perceive CLIs more effective than GUIs; and discussfindings also supported by observations from field studies. Our analysis indicates thatcognition-based trust and monitoring play major roles in the system administration toolselection.,*,2006,*

However; current browsers are still primitive; in that they do notSupport many of the navigation needs of users; as indicated by user studies. They do notprovide an overview and a sense of location in the information structure being browsed. Alsothey do not facilitate the organization and filtering of information nor aid users in accessingalready visited pages without much cognitive demands.

AVATAR: Beyond Keywords–Collaborative Information Extraction and Search,Eser Kandogan; Rajasekar Krishnamurty; Sriram Raghavan; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan; Huaiyu Zhu,ABSTRACT Existing search tools provide little support for information interaction activitiesbeyond simple keyword-based source retrieval. In order to effectively support the fulllifecycle of information interaction activities; tools need to support users in extracting;retrieving; manipulating; presenting; collaborating; and using information in their day-to-dayactivities. In this paper; we present our efforts in expanding the simple search interactionparadigm beyond source retrieval to collaborative information extraction and argue that weneed to move towards an information interaction language; one that is simple and informal;yet supports users in the full lifecycle of information activities.,ESI 2007,*,*
