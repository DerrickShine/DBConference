Effective xml keyword search with relevance oriented ranking,Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Bo Chen; Jiaheng Lu,Inspired by the great success of information retrieval (IR) style keyword search on the web;keyword search on XML has emerged recently. The difference between text database andXML database results in three new challenges:(1) Identify the user search intention; ieidentify the XML node types that user wants to search for and search via.(2) Resolvekeyword ambiguity problems: a keyword can appear as both a tag name and a text value ofsome node; a keyword can appear as the text values of different XML node types and carrydifferent meanings.(3) As the search results are sub-trees of the XML document; new scoringfunction is needed to estimate its relevance to a given query. However; existing methodscannot resolve these challenges; thus return low result quality in term of query relevance.

DDE: from dewey to a fully dynamic XML labeling scheme,Liang Xu; Tok Wang Ling; Huayu Wu; Zhifeng Bao,Abstract Labeling schemes lie at the core of query processing for many XML databasemanagement systems. Designing labeling schemes for dynamic XML documents is animportant problem that has received a lot of research attention. Existing dynamic labelingschemes; however; often sacrifice query performance and introduce additional labeling costto facilitate arbitrary updates even when the documents actually seldom get updated. Sincethe line between static and dynamic XML documents is often blurred in practice; we believeit is important to design a labeling scheme that is compact and efficient regardless ofwhether the documents are frequently updated or not. In this paper; we propose a novellabeling scheme called DDE (for Dynamic DEwey) which is tailored for both static anddynamic XML documents. For static documents; the labels of DDE are the same as those …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,99

Extended XML tree pattern matching: theories and algorithms,Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Zhifeng Bao; Chen Wang,As business and enterprises generate and exchange XML data more often; there is anincreasing need for efficient processing of queries on XML data. Searching for theoccurrences of a tree pattern query in an XML database is a core operation in XML queryprocessing. Prior works demonstrate that holistic twig pattern matching algorithm is anefficient technique to answer an XML tree pattern with parent-child (PC) and ancestor-descendant (AD) relationships; as it can effectively control the size of intermediate resultsduring query processing. However; XML query languages (eg; XPath and XQuery) definemore axes and functions such as negation function; order-based axis; and wildcards. In thispaper; we research a large set of XML tree pattern; called extended XML tree pattern; whichmay include PC; AD relationships; negation functions; wildcards; and order restriction.

Fast SLCA and ELCA computation for XML keyword queries based on set intersection,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Wei Wang; Tok Wang Ling; Ziyang Chen; Xudong Lin; Jingfeng Guo,In this paper; we focus on efficient keyword query processing for XML data based on theSLCA and ELCA semantics. We propose a novel form of inverted lists for keywords whichinclude IDs of nodes that directly or indirectly contain a given keyword. We propose a familyof efficient algorithms that are based on the set intersection operation for both semantics. Weshow that the problem of SLCA/ELCA computation becomes finding a set of nodes thatappear in all involved inverted lists and satisfy certain conditions. We also propose severaloptimization techniques to further improve the query processing performance. We haveconducted extensive experiments with many alternative methods. The results demonstratethat our proposed methods outperform previous methods by up to two orders of magnitudein many cases.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,47
A dynamic labeling scheme using vectors,Liang Xu; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract The labeling problem of dynamic XML documents has received increasing researchattention. When XML documents are subject to insertions and deletions of nodes; it isimportant to design a labeling scheme that efficiently facilitates updates as well asprocessing of XML queries. This paper proposes a novel encoding scheme; vector encodingwhich is orthogonal to existing labeling schemes and can completely avoid re-labeling.Extensive experiments show that our vector encoding outperforms existing labelingschemes on both label updates and query processing especially in the case of skewedupdates. Besides; it has the nice property of being conceptually easy to understand throughits graphical representation.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,37
High-power nanosecond optical parametric oscillator based on a long LiB3O5 crystal,HQ Li; HB Zhang; Z Bao; J Zhang; ZP Sun; YP Kong; Y Bi; XC Lin; AY Yao; GL Wang; W Hou; RN Li; DF Cui; ZY Xu,Abstract We report on a compact high average power optical parametric oscillator (OPO)pumped by an all-solid-state nanosecond 532 nm laser. Based on the merit of non-criticallyphase-matched crystal without walk-off effect; a 50-mm-long LiB 3 O 5 (LBO) crystal is usedas OPO nonlinear crystal to enhance the conversion efficiency and increase the outputpower. With the available mirror set; continuous tuning from 778 to 1036 nm for signal waveis obtained by changing LBO phase-matching temperature. The maximum average power ofsignal output is up to 9.4 W at 900 nm for pump power of 18 W inside the LBO crystal;corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 52% only for the signal output. This is; to the bestof our knowledge; the highest signal average power generated by nanosecond OPO insingle bulk LBO.,Optics communications,2004,31
Effective location identification from microblogs,Guoliang Li; Jun Hu; Jianhua Feng; Kian-lee Tan,The rapid development of social networks has resulted in a proliferation of user-generatedcontent (UGC). The UGC data; when properly analyzed; can be beneficial to manyapplications. For example; identifying a user's locations from microblogs is very important foreffective location-based advertisement and recommendation. In this paper; we study theproblem of identifying a user's locations from microblogs. This problem is rather challengingbecause the location information in a microblog is incomplete and we cannot get anaccurate location from a local microblog. To address this challenge; we propose a globallocation identification method; called Glitter. Glitter combines multiple microblogs of a userand utilizes them to identify the user's locations. Glitter not only improves the quality ofidentifying a user's location but also supplements the location of a microblog so as to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,30
Real time personalized search on social networks,Yuchen Li; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan,Internet users are shifting from searching on traditional media to social network platforms(SNPs) to retrieve up-to-date and valuable information. SNPs have two uniquecharacteristics: frequent content update and small world phenomenon. However; existingworks are not able to support these two features simultaneously. To address this problem;we develop a general framework to enable real time personalized top-k query. Ourframework is based on a general ranking function that incorporates time freshness; socialrelevance and textual similarity. To ensure efficient update and query processing; there aretwo key challenges. The first is to design an index structure that is update-friendly whilesupporting instant query processing. The second is to efficiently compute the socialrelevance in a complex graph.

A framework of joint graph embedding and sparse regression for dimensionality reduction,Xiaoshuang Shi; Zhenhua Guo; Zhihui Lai; Yujiu Yang; Zhifeng Bao; David Zhang,Over the past few decades; a large number of algorithms have been developed fordimensionality reduction. Despite the different motivations of these algorithms; they can beinterpreted by a common framework known as graph embedding. In order to explore thesignificant features of data; some sparse regression algorithms have been proposed basedon graph embedding. However; the problem is that these algorithms include two separatesteps:(1) embedding learning and (2) sparse regression. Thus their performance is largelydetermined by the effectiveness of the constructed graph. In this paper; we present aframework by combining the objective functions of graph embedding and sparse regressionso that embedding learning and sparse regression can be jointly implemented andoptimized; instead of simply using the graph spectral for sparse regression.

Location-aware pub/sub system: When continuous moving queries meet dynamic event streams,Long Guo; Dongxiang Zhang; Guoliang Li; Kian-Lee Tan; Zhifeng Bao,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new location-aware pub/sub system; Elaps; thatcontinuously monitors moving users subscribing to dynamic event streams from socialmedia and E-commerce applications. Users are notified instantly when there is a matchingevent nearby. To the best of our knowledge; Elaps is the first to take into account continuousmoving queries against dynamic event streams. Like existing works on continuous movingquery processing; Elaps employs the concept of safe region to reduce communicationoverhead. However; unlike existing works which assume data from publishers are static;updates to safe regions may be triggered by newly arrived events. In Elaps; we develop aconcept called\textit {impact region} that allows us to identify whether a safe region isaffected by newly arrived events. Moreover; we propose a novel cost model to optimize …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,28
An effective object-level XML keyword search,Zhifeng Bao; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Liang Xu; Huayu Wu,Abstract Keyword search is widely recognized as a convenient way to retrieve informationfrom XML data. In order to precisely meet users' search concerns; we study how to effectivelyreturn the targets that users intend to search for. We model XML document as a set ofinterconnected object-trees; where each object contains a subtree to represent a concept inthe real world. Based on this model; we propose object-level matching semantics calledInterested Single Object (ISO) and Interested Related Object (IRO) to capture single objectand multiple objects as user's search targets respectively; and design a novel relevanceoriented ranking framework for the matching results. We propose efficient algorithms tocompute and rank the query results in one phase. Finally; comprehensive experiments showthe efficiency and effectiveness of our approach; and an online demo of our system on …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,28
Crowdsourced poi labelling: Location-aware result inference and task assignment,Huiqi Hu; Yudian Zheng; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Jianhua Feng; Reynold Cheng,Identifying the labels of points of interest (POIs); aka POI labelling; provides significantbenefits in location-based services. However; the quality of raw labels manually added byusers or generated by artificial algorithms cannot be guaranteed. Such low-quality labelsdecrease the usability and result in bad user experiences. In this paper; by observing thatcrowdsourcing is a best-fit for computer-hard tasks; we leverage crowdsourcing to improvethe quality of POI labelling. To our best knowledge; this is the first work on crowdsourced POIlabelling tasks. In particular; there are two sub-problems:(1) how to infer the correct labels foreach POI based on workers' answers; and (2) how to effectively assign proper tasks toworkers in order to make more accurate inference for next available workers. To addressthese two problems; we propose a framework consisting of an inference model and an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,27
sonLP: social network link prediction by principal component regression,Zhifeng Bao; Yong Zeng; YC Tay,Social networks are driven by social interaction and therefore dynamic. When modeled as agraph; nodes and links are continually added and deleted; and there is considerable interestin social network analysis on predicting link formation. Current work has not adequatelyaddressed three issues:(1) Most link predictors start with using features from the linktopology as input. How do features in other dimensions of the social network data affect linkformation?(2) The dynamic nature of social networks implies the features driving linkformation are constantly changing. How can a predictor automatically select the features thatare important for link formation?(3) Node pairs that are not linked can outnumber links byorders of magnitude; but previous work do not address this imbalance.

Efficient query processing for XML keyword queries based on the IDList index,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Wei Wang; Jinjia Zhao; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Keyword search over XML data has attracted a lot of research efforts in the lastdecade; where one of the fundamental research problems is how to efficiently answer agiven keyword query wrt a certain query semantics. We found that the key factor resulting inthe inefficiency for existing methods is that they all heavily suffer from the common-ancestor-repetition problem. In this paper; we propose a novel form of inverted list; namely the IDList;the IDList for keyword k consists of ordered nodes that directly or indirectly contain k. Wethen show that finding keyword query results based on the smallest lowest commonancestor and exclusive lowest common ancestor semantics can be reduced to ordered setintersection problem; which has been heavily optimized due to its application in areas suchas information retrieval and database systems. We propose several algorithms that …,The VLDB Journal,2014,22
A semantic approach to keyword search over relational databases,Zhong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Mong Li Lee; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Research in relational keyword search has been focused on the efficientcomputation of results as well as strategies to rank and output the most relevant ones.However; the challenge to retrieve the intended results remains. Existing relational keywordsearch techniques suffer from the problem of returning overwhelming number of results;many of which may not be useful. In this work; we adopt a semantic approach to relationalkeyword search via an Object-Relationship-Mixed data graph. This graph is constructedbased on database schema constraints to capture the semantics of objects and relationshipsin the data. Each node in the ORM data graph represents either an object; or a relationship;or both. We design an algorithm that utilizes the ORM data graph to process keywordqueries. Experiment results show our approach returns more informative results …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2013,20
Crowdsourcing-based real-time urban traffic speed estimation: From trends to speeds,Huiqi Hu; Guoliang Li; Zhifeng Bao; Yan Cui; Jianhua Feng,Real-time urban traffic speed estimation provides significant benefits in many real-worldapplications. However; existing traffic information acquisition systems only obtain coarse-grained traffic information on a small number of roads but cannot acquire fine-grained trafficinformation on every road. To address this problem; in this paper we study the traffic speedestimation problem; which; given a budget K; identifies K roads (called seeds) where thereal traffic speeds on these seeds can be obtained using crowdsourcing; and infers thespeeds of other roads (called non-seed roads) based on the speeds of these seeds. Thisproblem includes two sub-problems:(1) Speed Inference-How to accurately infer the speedsof the non-seed roads;(2) Seed Selection-How to effectively select high-quality seeds. It israther challenging to estimate the traffic speed accurately; because the traffic changes …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,15

Top-k spatio-textual similarity join,Huiqi Hu; Guoliang Li; Zhifeng Bao; Jianhua Feng; Yongwei Wu; Zhiguo Gong; Yaoqiang Xu,With the development of location-based services (LBS); LBS users are generating more andmore spatio-textual data; eg; checkins and attraction reviews. Since a spatio-textual entitymay have different representations; possibly due to GPS deviations or typographical errors;it calls for effective methods to integrate the spatio-textual data from different data sources. Inthis paper; we study the problem of top-$ k $ spatio-textual similarity join (Topk-STJoin);which identifies the $ k $ most similar pairs from two spatio-textual data sets. One bigchallenge in Topk-STJoin is to efficiently identify the top-$ k $ similar pairs by consideringboth textual relevancy and spatial proximity. Traditional join algorithms that consider onlyone dimension (textual or spatial) are inefficient because they cannot utilize the pruningability on the other dimension. To address this challenge; we propose a signature-based …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,11
ExpressQ: Identifying keyword context and search target in relational keyword queries,Zhong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Thuy Ngoc Le; Mong Li Lee; Wang Tok Ling,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases has gained popularity due to its ease ofuse. However; the challenge to return query answers that satisfy users' information needremains. Traditional keyword queries have limited expressive capability and are ambiguous.In this work; we extend keyword queries to enhance their expressive power and describe ansemantic approach to process these queries. Our approach considers keywords that matchmeta-data such as the names of relations and attributes; and utilizes them to provide thecontext of subsequent keywords in the query. Based on the ORM schema graph whichcaptures the semantics of objects and relationships in the database; we determine theobjects and relationships referred to by the keywords in order to infer the search target of thequery. Then; we construct a set of minimal connected graphs called query patterns; to …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,11
Efficient provenance storage for relational queries,Zhifeng Bao; Henning Köhler; Liwei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Provenance information is vital in many application areas as it helps explain datalineage and derivation. However; storing fine-grained provenance information can beexpensive. In this paper; we present a framework for storing provenance information relatingto data derived via database queries. In particular; we first propose a provenance tree datastructure which matches the query structure and thereby presents a possibility to avoidredundant storage of information regarding the derivation process. Then we investigate twoapproaches for reducing storage costs. The first approach utilizes two ingenious rules toachieve reduction on provenance trees. The second one is a dynamic programmingsolution; which provides a way of optimizing the selection of query tree nodes whereprovenance information should be stored. The optimization algorithm runs in polynomial …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,11
Xreal: an interactive xml keyword searching,Zhifeng Bao; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Keyword search over XML data usually brings irrelevant results especially when thekeywords in a user query have ambiguities. We demonstrate a statistic-based approach toidentify the search targets and constraints of a user query in the presence of keywordambiguities; and come out a relevance oriented result ranking scheme called XML TF* IDF.Since the search intention of a same query may even vary from user to user; we provide aninteractive search strategy by allowing user to simply tick their desired search targets from alist of suggestions recommended by the search engine. In this way; we can acquire moreprecise results and also take the burden of learning the schema of XML data off users.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,11
Reducing graph matching to tree matching for XML queries with ID references,Huayu Wu; Tok Wang Ling; Gillian Dobbie; Zhifeng Bao; Liang Xu,Abstract ID/IDREF is an important and widely used feature in XML documents for eliminatingdata redundancy. Most existing algorithms consider an XML document with ID references asa graph and perform graph matching for queries involving ID references. Graph matchingnaturally brings higher complexity compared with original tree matching algorithms thatprocess XML queries. In this paper; we make use of semantics of ID/IDREF to reduce graphmatching to tree matching to process queries involving ID references. Using our approach;an XML document with ID/IDREF is not treated as a graph; and a general query with IDreferences will be decomposed and processed using tree pattern matching techniques;which are more efficient than graph matching. Furthermore; our approach is able to handlecomplex ID references; such as cyclic references and sequential references; which …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,11
Performing grouping and aggregate functions in XML queries,Huayu Wu; Tok Wang Ling; Liang Xu; Zhifeng Bao,Abstract Since more and more business data are represented in XML format; there is acompelling need of supporting analytical operations in XML queries. Particularly; the latestversion of XQuery proposed by W3C; XQuery 1.1; introduces a new construct to explicitlyexpress grouping operation in FLWOR expression. Existing works in XML query processingmainly focus on physically matching query structure over XML document. Given the explicitgrouping operation in a query; how to efficiently compute grouping and aggregate functionsover XML document is not well studied yet. In this paper; we extend our previous XML queryprocessing algorithm; VERT; to efficiently perform grouping and aggregate function inqueries. The main technique of our approach is introducing relational tables to index values.Query pattern matching and aggregation computing are both conducted with table indices …,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,11
SemanticTwig: a semantic approach to optimize XML query processing,Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Jiaheng Lu; Bo Chen,Abstract Twig pattern matching (TPM) is the core operation of XML query processing.Existing approaches rely on either efficient data structures or novel labeling/indexingschemes to reduce the intermediate result size; but none of them takes into account the richsemantic information resided in XML document and the query issued. Moreover; in order tofulfill the semantics of the XPath/XQuery query; most of them require costly post processingto eliminate redundant matches and group matching results. In this paper; we propose aninnovative semantics-aware query optimization approach to overcome these limitations. Inparticular; we exploit the functional dependency derived from the given semantic informationto stop query processing early; we distinguish the output and predicate nodes of a query;then propose a query breakup technique and build a query plan; such that for each …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,11
Breaking out of the mismatch trap,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; HV Jagadish; Guoliang Li,When users issue a query to a database; they have expectations about the results. If whatthey search for is unavailable in the database; the system will return an empty result or;worse; erroneous mismatch results. We call this problem the MisMatch Problem. In thispaper; we solve the MisMatch problem in the context of XML keyword search. Our solution isbased on two novel concepts that we introduce: Target Node Type and Distinguishability.Using these concepts; we develop a low-cost post-processing algorithm on the results ofquery evaluation to detect the MisMatch problem and generate helpful suggestions to users.Our approach has three noteworthy features:(1) for queries with the MisMatch problem; itgenerates the explanation; suggested queries and their sample results as the output tousers; helping users judge whether the MisMatch problem is solved without reading all …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,10
The price is right,Ruiming Tang; Huayu Wu; Zhifeng Bao; Stéphane Bressan; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Data is a modern commodity. Yet the pricing models in use on electronic datamarkets either focus on the usage of computing resources; or are proprietary; opaque; mostlikely ad hoc; and not conducive of a healthy commodity market dynamics. In this paper wepropose a generic data pricing model that is based on minimal provenance; ie minimal setsof tuples contributing to the result of a query. We show that the proposed model fulfillsdesirable properties such as contribution monotonicity; bounded-price and contributionarbitrage-freedom. We present a baseline algorithm to compute the exact price of a querybased on our pricing model. We show that the problem is NP-hard. We therefore devise;present and compare several heuristics. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study toshow their effectiveness and efficiency.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,10
iSearch: an interpretation based framework for keyword search in relational databases,Zhong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Keyword search has become an effective information retrieval method for structureddata. Existing works in relational database keyword search have addressed the problems offinding and evaluating candidate results. However; given that keyword queries areinherently ambiguous; it is often the case that candidate results do not match users' searchintention. In this paper; we analyze the limitations of current keyword search techniques andintroduce the problem of generating and ranking keyword query interpretations. We proposea novel 3-phase keyword search paradigm which consists of:(1) the ability to predict queryinterpretations;(2) incorporate user feedback to to remove keyword ambiguities;(3) a rankingmodel to evaluate a query interpretation.,Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Keyword Search on Structured Data,2012,10
Fast result enumeration for keyword queries on XML data,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Ziyang Chen; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract In this paper; we focus on efficient construction of tightest matched subtree(TMSubtree) results for keyword queries on XML data based on SLCA semantics; where“matched” means that all nodes in a returned subtree satisfy the constraint that the set ofdistinct keywords of the subtree rooted at each node is not subsumed by that of any of itssibling node; while “tightest” means that no two subtrees rooted at two sibling nodes cancontain the same set of keywords. Assume that d is the depth of a given TMSubtree; m is thenumber of keywords of a given query Q; we proved that if d≤ m; a matched subtree resulthas at most 2 m! nodes; otherwise; the size of a matched subtree result is bounded by (d−m+ 2) m!. Based on this theoretical result; we propose a pipelined algorithm to constructTMSubtree results without rescanning all node labels.

Efficient label encoding for range-based dynamic XML labeling schemes,Liang Xu; Tok Wang Ling; Zhifeng Bao; Huayu Wu,Abstract Designing dynamic labeling schemes to support order-sensitive queries for XMLdocuments has been recognized as an important research problem. In this work; weconsider the problem of making range-based XML labeling schemes dynamic through theprocess of encoding. We point out the problems of existing encoding algorithms whichinclude computational and memory inefficiencies. We introduce a novel Search Tree-based(ST) encoding technique to overcome these problems. We show that ST encoding is widelyapplicable to different dynamic labels and prove the optimality of our results. In addition;when combining with encoding table compression; ST encoding provides high flexibility ofmemory usage. Experimental results confirm the benefits of our encoding techniques overthe previous encoding algorithms.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,9

To explore nearbyevents; mobile users can query a location based search engine for the desired data.However; operating under such a pull based model means that users may miss interestingevents (because no explicit queries are issued) or processing/communication overheadsmay be high (because users have to continuously issue queries).

Schema-independence in xml keyword search,Thuy Ngoc Le; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract XML keyword search has attracted a lot of interests with typical search based onlowest common ancestor (LCA). However; in this paper; we show that meaningful answerscan be found beyond LCA and should be independent from schema designs of the samedata content. Therefore; we propose a new semantics; called CR (C ommon R elative);which not only can find more answers beyond LCA; but the returned answers areindependent from schema designs as well. To find answers based on the CR semantics; wepropose an approach; in which we have new strategies for indexing and processing.Experimental results show that the CR semantics can improve the recall significantly and theanswer set is independent from the schema designs.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2014,7

Top-down SLCA computation based on list partition,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Ziyang Chen; Guoxiang Lan; Xudong Lin; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract In this paper; we focus on efficient processing of a given XML keyword query basedon SLCA semantics. We propose an efficient algorithm that processes all nodes in the set ofinverted Dewey label lists in a top-down way. Specifically; our method recursively dividesthe set of initial Dewey label lists into a set of minimum nontrivial block s (MNBlock s); wherea block consists of a set of Dewey label lists and corresponds to an XML tree. The“minimum” means that for a given block; none of its sub-blocks corresponds to a subtree thatcontains all keywords of the given query; the “nontrivial” means that no block can contain anempty list. Based on these MNBlocks; our method produces all qualified results by directlyoutputting the LCA node of all nodes in each MNBlock as a qualified SLCA node. Duringprocessing; our method can intelligently prune useless keyword nodes according to the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,7
Adaptive task scheduling strategy in cloud: when energy consumption meets performance guarantee,Yao Shen; Zhifeng Bao; Xiaolin Qin; Jian Shen,Abstract Energy efficiency of cloud computing has been given great attention more than everbefore. One of the challenges is how to strike a balance between minimizing the energyconsumption and meeting the quality of services such as satisfying performance andresource availability in a timely manner.

Recent studies focused on the processing ofspatial keyword queries which retrieve objects that match certain keywords within a spatialregion. To ensure effective retrieval; various extensions were done including the allowanceof errors in keyword matching and auto completion using prefix matching. In this paper; wepropose INSPIRE; a general framework; which adopts a unifying strategy for processingdifferent variants of spatial keyword queries. We adopt the auto completion paradigm thatgenerates an initial query as a prefix matching query. If there are few matching results; othervariants are performed as a form of relaxation that reuses the processing done in the earlierphase. The types of relaxation allowed include spatial region expansion andexact/approximate prefix/substring matching.

Removing the mismatch headache in xml keyword search,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Guoliang Li,Abstract In this demo; we study one category of query refinement problems in the context ofXML keyword search; where what users search for do not exist in the data while uselessresults are returned by the search engine. It is a hidden but important problem. We refer to itas the MisMatch problem. We propose a practical yet efficient way to detect the MisMatchproblem and generate helpful suggestions to users; namely MisMatch detector andsuggester. Our approach can be viewed as a post-processing job of query evaluation. Anonline XML keyword search engine embedding the MisMatch detector and suggester hasbeen built and is available at [1].,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,6
XML keyword query refinement,Jiaheng Lu; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Existing works in XML keyword search have addressed the problem of findingmatching results of a query. However; user input queries always contain irrelevant ormismatched terms; spelling errors etc; which causes the search results to be either empty ornot meaningful. In this paper; we introduce the problem of XML keyword query refinement;and propose a set of effective and efficient solutions. Finally; extensive experiments showthe efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Keyword Search on Structured Data,2009,6
Using semantics in XML query processing,Zhifeng Bao; Huayu Wu; Bo Chen; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Efficient query processing in XML database has attracted extensive research efforts.However; majority of existing approaches for XML query processing do not exploit semanticinformation in the underlying database. In this paper; we address the importance of usingsemantics for XML query processing. In particular; we consider two common types of queriesin XML; twig pattern query and keyword search query. We discuss how semantics can beused for optimizing twig pattern queries. Then; we discuss the usage of semantics tointerpret keyword queries in order to retrieve and rank the most relevant results to users.,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Ubiquitous information management and communication,2008,6
Exploratory keyword search with interactive input,Zhifeng Bao; Yong Zeng; HV Jagadish; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Due to the intrinsic ambiguity of keyword queries; users usually need to reformulatetheir queries multiple times to get the desired information. Even worse; users either have noway to precisely specify their search intention; or have limited domain knowledge on thedata to precisely express their search intention. Moreover; they may just have a generalinterest to explore the data by keyword query. Therefore; our goal is to design an exploratorysearch paradigm that is able to bring humans more actively into the search process; in orderto meet various user information needs; ranging from simple lookup to learning andunderstanding of the data. Besides; keyword queries against data with structure; such asXML; can run into multiple difficulties: how to identify the search target; more types ofambiguity arise as a keyword can be part of the structure as well as content of data; etc …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,5
Towards an interactive keyword search over relational databases,Zhong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Mong Li Lee; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Keyword search over relational databases has been widely studied for theexploration of structured data in a user-friendly way. However; users typically have limiteddomain knowledge or are unable to precisely specify their search intention. Existingmethods find the minimal units that contain all the query keywords; and largely ignore theinterpretation of possible users' search intentions. As a result; users are often overwhelmedwith a lot of irrelevant answers. Moreover; without a visually pleasing way to present theanswers; users often have difficulty understanding the answers because of their complexstructures. Therefore; we design an interactive yet visually pleasing search paradigm calledExpressQ. ExpressQ extends the keyword query language to include keywords that matchmeta-data; eg; names of relations and attributes. These keywords are utilized to infer …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,5
Group-by and aggregate functions in XML keyword search,Thuy Ngoc Le; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Gillian Dobbie,Abstract In this paper; we study how to support group-by and aggregate functions in XMLkeyword search. It goes beyond the simple keyword query; and raises several challengesincluding:(1) how to address the keyword ambiguity problem when interpreting a keywordquery;(2) how to identify duplicated objects and relationships in order to guarantee thecorrectness of the results of aggregation functions; and (3) how to compute a keyword querywith group-by and aggregate functions. We propose an approach to address the abovechallenges. As a result; our approach enables users to explore the data as much as possiblewith simple keyword queries. The experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that ourapproach can support keyword queries with group-by and aggregate functions which are notaddressed by the LCA-based approaches while achieving a similar response time to that …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2014,5
MESA: A map service to support fuzzy type-ahead search over geo-textual data,Yuxin Zheng; Zhifeng Bao; Lidan Shou; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Geo-textual data are ubiquitous these days. Recent study on spatial keywordsearch focused on the processing of queries which retrieve objects that match certainkeywords within a spatial region. To ensure effective data retrieval; various extensions weredone including the tolerance of errors in keyword matching and the search-as-you-typefeature using prefix matching. We present MESA; a map application to support differentvariants of spatial keyword query. In this demonstration; we adopt the autocompletionparadigm that generates the initial query as a prefix matching query.

Efficient xml keyword search: from graph model to tree model,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Guoliang Li,Abstract Keyword search; as opposed to traditional structured query; has been becomingmore and more popular on querying XML data in recent years. XML documents usuallycontain some ID nodes and IDREF nodes to represent reference relationships among thedata. An XML document with ID/IDREF is modeled as a graph by existing works; where thekeyword query results are computed by graph traversal. As a comparison; if ID/IDREF is notconsidered; an XML document can be modeled as a tree. Keyword search on XML tree canbe much more efficient using tree-based labeling techniques. A nature question is whetherwe need to abandon the efficient XML tree search methods and invent new; but less efficientsearch methods for XML graph. To address this problem; we propose a novel method totransform an XML graph to a tree model such that we can exploit existing XML tree search …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,5
Visualization-aided exploration of the real estate data,Mingzhao Li; Zhifeng Bao; Timos Sellis; Shi Yan,Abstract An efficient analysis of the real estate data is critical for buyers to understand thereal estate market and seek appropriate properties to live in or rent. In this paper; we firstcollect data from different channels which are not provided in existing commercial real estatesystems; and integrate them to build a location-centred comprehensive real estate dataset;including information other than the house itself; such as education profile; transportationprofile and regional profile. Then we develop HouseSeeker; a visualization-aided system forbuyers to explore the real estate data; find appropriate properties based on their individualrequirements; and compare properties/suburbs from different aspects to discover thestrengths and weaknesses of each property/suburb.

A general framework to resolve the MisMatch problem in XML keyword search,Zhifeng Bao; Yong Zeng; Tok Wang Ling; Dongxiang Zhang; Guoliang Li; HV Jagadish,Abstract When users issue a query to a database; they have expectations about the results.If what they search for is unavailable in the database; the system will return an empty resultor; worse; erroneous mismatch results. We call this problem the MisMatch problem. In thispaper; we solve the MisMatch problem in the context of XML keyword search. Our solution isbased on two novel concepts that we introduce: target node type and Distinguishability.Target Node Type represents the type of node a query result intends to match; andDistinguishability is used to measure the importance of the query keywords. Using theseconcepts; we develop a low-cost post-processing algorithm on the results of queryevaluation to detect the MisMatch problem and generate helpful suggestions to users. Ourapproach has three noteworthy features:(1) for queries with the MisMatch problem; it …,The VLDB Journal,2015,4

Supporting range queries in XML keyword search,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract XML data is normally queried by rigorous structured query languages; eg; XPath;XQuery; etc. In recent years keyword search has become more and more popular because itprovides a more user-friendly way to explore data. Keyword search on XML data has alsobeen a hot research issue recently. So far none of the existing XML keyword searchmethods has considered range queries. In this paper we point out that supporting rangequeries in XML keyword search is beneficial and non-trivial to the user; especially in thecase of querying business semi-structured data; where numerals (like stock price; productquantity; market share percentage; etc.) could be the main part of the data. Actually existingXML keyword search methods do not support range queries at two levels: keyword querysyntax level and keyword search method level.

MALEX: a MAp-like exploration model on XML database,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Luochen Li,Abstract Keyword search on XML data has been a hot research issue recently. Towards theultimate goal of retrieving results that match user's search intention; existing methods keepimproving the matching semantics and result retrieval methods. A list of query results in theform of subtrees will be returned to the users. However; we find that the traditional way ofreturning a list of subtrees to the users is still not sufficient to meet users' information needsbecause:(1) search intention of a keyword query can be different with different users issuingit;(2) amongst the query results; they may have sibling and containment relationships; whichcould be important for digesting the query results and should be displayed to the users aswell. To address the problem; we propose a new exploration model MALEX to work as acomplementary component of the XML keyword search engine; in order to enhance users …,Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Keyword Search on Structured Data,2012,3
Answering top-k exemplar trajectory queries,Sheng Wang; Zhifeng Bao; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis; Mark Sanderson; Xiaolin Qin,We study a new type of spatial-textual trajectory search: the Exemplar Trajectory Query(ETQ); which specifies one or more places to visit; and descriptions of activities at eachplace. Our goal is to efficiently find the top-k trajectories by computing spatial and textualsimilarity at each point. The computational cost for pointwise matching is significantly higherthan previous approaches. Therefore; we introduce an incremental pruning baseline andexplore how to adaptively tune our approach; introducing a gap-based optimization and anovel twolevel threshold algorithm to improve efficiency. Our proposed methods supportorder-sensitive ETQ with a minor extension. Experiments on two datasets verify theefficiency and scalability of our proposed solution.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,2
Interactive trip planning using activity trajectories,Sheng Wang; Zhifeng Bao; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis; Mark Sanderson; Munkh-Erdene Yadamjav,Abstract We present an interactive trip planning system called@ FINDER which uses anexemplar trajectory query to find the most related top-k spatial-textual trajectories.@ FINDERis implemented to support various degrees of user information needs for trip planning. Forusers with zero knowledge about places to travel;@ FINDER provides a heatmap of popularpoints of interest (POIs) as well as popular activities from a trajectory database.

Semantic path ranking scheme for relational keyword queries,Zhong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Gillian Dobbie; Mong Li Lee; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Existing works on keyword search over relational databases typically do notconsider users' search intention for a query and return many answers which oftenoverwhelm users. We observe that a database is in fact a repository of real world objects thatinteract with each other via relationships. In this work; we identify four types of semanticpaths between objects and design an algorithm called pathRank to compute and rank theresults of keyword queries. The answers are grouped by the types of semantic paths whichreflect different query interpretations; and are annotated to facilitate user understanding.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2014,2
MVP Index: Towards efficient known-item search on large graphs,Ming Zhong; Mengchi Liu; Zhifeng Bao; Xuhui Li; Tieyun Qian,Abstract This paper is motivated by the lack of study on the diversity of user informationneeds in the scenario of graph search; which offers the prospect of significant improvementson search. We report our investigation on this issue; and then exploit the knowledge tooptimize a commonly-used type of graph search: known-item search which only wants theanswer trees of a familiar and compact pattern. To address the problem; we propose a novelMVP (Matched Vertex Pruning) index; which captures the query-independent localconnectivity information in the graph; to reduce the search space with heuristics by pruningmatched vertices that will not participate in the answer trees with heights less than athreshold. Moreover; our optimization approach is independent of search algorithm; andrequires the minimal index access times.

Dima: A distributed in-memory similarity-based query processing system,Ji Sun; Zeyuan Shang; Guoliang Li; Dong Deng; Zhifeng Bao,Abstract Data analysts in industries spend more than 80% of time on data cleaning andintegration in the whole process of data analytics due to data errors and inconsistencies. Itcalls for effective query processing techniques to tolerate the errors and inconsistencies. Inthis paper; we develop a distributed in-memory similarity-based query processing systemcalled Dima. Dima supports two core similarity-based query operations; ie; similarity searchand similarity join. Dima extends the SQL programming interface for users to easily invokethese two operations in their data analysis jobs. To avoid expensive data transformation in adistributed environment; we design selectable signatures where two records approximatelymatch if they share common signatures. More importantly; we can adaptively select thesignatures to balance the workload. Dima builds signature-based global indexes and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Monitoring the top-m rank aggregation of spatial objects in streaming queries,Farhana M Choudhury; Zhifeng Bao; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis,In this paper; we propose and study the problem of top-m rank aggregation of spatial objectsin streaming queries; where; given a set of objects O; a stream of spatial queries (kNN orrange); the goal is to report the m objects with the highest aggregate rank. The rank of anobject with respect to an individual query is computed based on its distance from the querylocation; and the aggregate rank is computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Inorder to solve this problem; we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an object forany unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to continuously monitor thetop-m objects efficiently; for which we design an Inverted Rank File (IRF) index to guaranteethe error bound of the solution. In particular; we propose the notion of safe ranking todetermine whether the current result is still valid or not when new queries arrive; and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Monitoring the top-m aggregation in a sliding window of spatial queries,Farhana M Choudhury; Zhifeng Bao; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis,Abstract: In this paper; we propose and study the problem of top-m rank aggregation ofspatial objects in streaming queries; where; given a set of objects O; a stream of spatialqueries (kNN or range); the goal is to report m objects with the highest aggregate rank. Therank of an object wrt an individual query is computed based on its distance from the querylocation; and the aggregate rank is computed from all of the individual rank orderings.Solutions to this fundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatialobjects; which in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data.

Monochromatic and bichromatic reverse top-k group nearest neighbor queries,Bin Zhang; Tao Jiang; Zhifeng Bao; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Li Chen,Abstract The Group Nearest Neighbor (GNN) search is an important approach for expert andintelligent systems; ie; Geographic Information System (GIS) and Decision Support System(DSS). However; traditional GNN search starts from users' perspective and selects thelocations or objects that users like. Such applications fail to help the managers since they donot provide managerial insights. In this paper; we focus on solving the problem from themanagers' perspective. In particular; we propose a novel GNN query; namely; the reversetop-k group nearest neighbor (RkGNN) query which returns k groups of data objects so thateach group has the query object q as their group nearest neighbor (GNN). This query is animportant tool for decision support; eg; location-based service; product data analysis; tripplanning; and disaster management because it provides data analysts an intuitive way for …,Expert Systems with Applications,2016,1
Social-aware visualized exploration of tourist behaviours,Mingzhao Li; Zhifeng Bao; Liangjun Song; Henry Duh,The popularity of social media has generated an abundance of publicly available data abouttourist behaviour. We aim to exploit this to provide a snapshot of customized routes for pre-trip tourists and help the tourism industry understand the real behaviour of tourists for betterpolicy making. Therefore; we propose an analytic framework that is able to automaticallycollect; clean and integrate all forms of tourists' activity data from various social media sites;and provides an interactive yet visualized analysis to facilitate users' exploration ofunderlying data. Specifically; it is able to (1) support multidimensional views of tourists'trajectory data; eg temporally; spatially; textually; etc;(2) support multi-granularityvisualization where the trajectory of either a group of tourists or a single tourist can beefficiently retrieved.,Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp); 2016 International Conference on,2016,1

Exploring XML data is as easy as using maps,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract For keyword search on XML data; traditionally; a list of query results in the form ofsubtrees will be returned to users. However; we find that it is still not sufficient to meet users'information needs because:(1) the search intention of a certain keyword query varies fromperson to person;(2) amongst the query results; they may have sibling or containmentrelationships (in the context of whole XML database); which could be important for users todigest the query results and should be shown to users. Therefore; we try to equip thetraditional XML keyword search engine with our new exploration model XMAP; providinguser an interactive yet novel way to explore the results with better user experience.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,1
Breaking out the xml mismatch trap,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Tok Wang Ling; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract In keyword search; when user cannot get what she wants; query refinement isneeded and reason can be various. We first give a thorough categorization of the reason;then focus on solving one category of query refinement problem in the context of XMLkeyword search; where what user searches for does not exist in the data. We refer to it as theMisMatch problem in this paper. Then we propose a practical way to detect the MisMatchproblem and generate helpful suggestions to users. Our approach can be viewed as a post-processing job of query evaluation; and has three main features:(1) it adopts both thesuggested queries and their sample results as the output to user; helping user judgewhether the MisMatch problem is solved without consuming all query results;(2) it is portablein the sense that it can work with any LCA-based matching semantics and orthogonal to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.2448,2012,1
Related axis: The extension to XPath towards effective XML search,Jun-Feng Zhou; Tok Wang Ling; Zhi-Feng Bao; Xiao-Feng Meng,Abstract We investigate the limitations of existing XML search methods and propose a newsemantics; related relationship; to effectively capture meaningful relationships of dataelements from XML data in the absence of structural constraints. Then we make anextension to XPath by introducing a new axis; related axis; to specify the related relationshipbetween query nodes so as to enhance the flexibility of XPath. We propose to reduce thecost of computing the related relationship by a new schema summary that summarizes therelated relationship from the original schema without any loss. Based on this schemasummary; we introduce two indices to improve the performance of query processing.

Storage and use of provenance information for relational database queries,Zhifeng Bao; Henning Koehler; Xiaofang Zhou; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract In database querying; provenance information can help users understand wheredata comes from and how it is derived. Storing the provenance data is critical in the sensethat; the storage cost should be as small as possible and of fine granularity; and it shouldsupport the user query on provenance tracking efficiently as well. In this demo; we haveimplemented a relational database system prototype which can support SQL-like querywhile supporting provenance data recording during query execution. In particular; wepropose a tree structure to store provenance information and further propose variousreduction strategies to optimize its storage cost; we support the functionality of provenancedata tracking at tuple level for user queries in a visualized way.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,1

Trajectory-driven Influential Billboard Placement,Ping Zhang; Zhifeng Bao; Yuchen Li; Guoliang Li; Yipeng Zhang; Zhiyong Peng,Abstract: In this paper we propose and study the problem of trajectory-driven influentialbillboard placement: given a set of billboards $ U $(each associated with a location and acost); a database of trajectories $\mathcal {T} $ and a budget $ L $; the goal is to find a set ofbillboards within the budget so that the placed ad can influence the largest number oftrajectories. One core challenge is that multiple billboards have influence overlap ontrajectories and it is critical to identify and reduce the influence overlap. Two moreconstraints on top of this challenge; ie; the budget constraint and non-uniform costsassociated with each billboard; make this optimization problem more intricate. We show thatthis problem is NP-hard and propose an enumeration based algorithm with $(1-1/e) $approximation ratio and $ O (|\mathcal {T}|\cdot| U|^{5}) $ time complexity; where …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.02254,2018,*

Supporting Large-scale Geographical Visualization in a Multi-granularity Way,Mingzhao Li; Zhifeng Bao; Farhana Choudhury; Timos Sellis,Abstract Urban data (eg; real estate data; crime data) often have multiple attributes whichare highly geography-related.

A query refinement framework for xml keyword search,Zhifeng Bao; Yi Yu; Jian Shen; Zhangjie Fu,Abstract Existing work of XML keyword search focus on how to find relevant and meaningfuldata fragments for a query; assuming each keyword is intended as part of it. However; inXML keyword search; user queries usually contain irrelevant or mismatched terms; typos etc;which may easily lead to empty or meaningless results. In this paper; we introduce theproblem of content-aware XML keyword query refinement; where the search engine shouldjudiciously decide whether a user query Q needs to be refined during the processing of Q;and find a list of promising refined query candidates which guarantee to have meaningfulmatching results over the XML data; without any user interaction or a second try. To achievethis goal; we build a novel content-aware XML keyword query refinement frameworkconsisting of two core parts:(1) we build a query ranking model to evaluate the quality of a …,World Wide Web,2017,*
Boosting Point-Based Trajectory Search with Quad-Tree,Munkh-Erdene Yadamjav; Sheng Wang; Zhifeng Bao; Bang Zhang,Abstract The availability of spatial data generated by objects enables people to search for asimilar pattern using a set of query points. In this paper; we focus on point-based trajectorysearch problem which returns top-k results to a set of query points. The primary purpose ofthis work is to revisit state-of-the-art search algorithms on various indices and find the bestchoice of spatial index while giving a reason behind it. Furthermore; we propose anoptimization on the search method; which is able to find the initial upper bound for the querypoints; leading to further performance improvement.

Tide-tree: A self-tuning indexing scheme for hybrid storage system,Sheng Wang; Xiaolin Qin; Zhifeng Bao; Bohan Li,Abstract Main memory index is built with the assumption that the RAM is sufficiently large tohold data. Due to the volatility and high unit price of main memory; indices under secondarymemory such as SSD and HDD are widely used. However; the I/O operation with mainmemory is still the bottleneck for query efficiency. In this paper; we propose a self-tuningindexing scheme called Tide-tree for RAM/Disk-based hybrid storage system. Tide-tree aimsto overcome the obstacles main memory and disk-based indices face; and performs like thetide to achieve a double-win in space and performance; which is self-adaptive with respectto the running environment.

Active learning via local structure reconstruction,Qin Li; Xiaoshuang Shi; Linfei Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Zhenhua Guo,Abstract To select the most representative data points for labeling; two typical active learningmethods; Transductive Experimental Design (TED) and Robust Representation andStructured Sparsity (RRSS); have been recently proposed. They yield impressive results.However; both of them neglected the local structure of data points which is helpful forselecting representative data points.

Then an optimization model is formulated to fulfill the data point reconstruction andselect the most representative data points.

Thissummarization problem is different from the classic ones in two aspects:(i) It is consideredover a large-scale; dynamic data with high updating frequency;(ii) the context betweenmicroblogs are taken into account. We first prove that the CSMT problem is NP-hard. Thenwe propose a greedy algorithm with (1-1/e) performance guarantee. Finally we extend the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2017,*
Joint top-k subscription query processing over microblog threads,Liangjun Song; Zhifeng Bao; Farhana Choudhury; Timos Sellis,Abstract With an increasing amount of social media messages; users on the social platformsstart to seek ideas and opinions by themselves. Publishers/Subscriber queries (akapub/sub) are utilized by these who want to actively read and consume web data. Socialmedia platforms give people opportunities to communicate with others. The social propertyis also important in the pub/sub while currently no other works have ever considered thisproperty. Also; platforms like Twitter only allow users to post a short message which causesthe short-text problem: single posts lack of contextual information. Therefore; we propose themicroblog thread as the minimum information unit to capture social and textual relevantinformation. However; this brings several challenges to this problem: 1.

Exploiting semantics for XML keyword search,Thuy Ngoc Le; Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract XML keyword search has attracted a lot of interests with typical search based onlowest common ancestor (LCA). However; in this paper; we show several problems of theLCA-based approaches; including meaningless answers; incomplete answers; duplicatedanswers; missing answers; and schema-dependent answers. To handle these problems; weexploit the semantics of object; object identifier; relationship; and attribute (referred to as theORA-semantics). Based on the ORA-semantics; we introduce new ways of labeling andmatching. More importantly; we propose a new semantics; called CR (Common Relative) forXML keyword search; which can return answers independent from schema designs. To findanswers based on the CR semantics; we discover properties of common relative andpropose an efficient algorithms. Experimental results show the seriousness of the …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2015,*

SonSQL: An extensible relational DBMS for social network start-ups,Zhifeng Bao; Jingbo Zhou; YC Tay,The mushrooming of online social networks is now as unstoppable as the spread of theWeb. Their datasets are heterogeneous and; sometimes; huge. Whatever its size; such a networkneeds a database system to properly manage its data. However; a small start-up with limiteddatabase expertise may pick a non-extensible design that is hard to modify when more featuresare included as the social network grows. The database research community should help suchstart-ups by designing and engineering a robust and scalable system that is customized for managingsocial network data. Our contribution to solving the problem is sonSQL (“son” for “socialnetwork”). We plan to develop sonSQL into the default database system for social networks.

Fast SLCA and ELCA Computation for XML Keyword Query Based on Set Intersection Operation,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Wei Wang; Wang Ling TOK; Ziyang Chen; Xudong Lin; Jingfeng Guo,In this paper; we focus on efficient keyword query processing on XML data based on SLCAand ELCA semantics. We have an elaborate design of the keyword inverted list to efficientlylocate the nodes that directly or indirectly contain a given keyword. We propose a family ofalgorithms that are based on set intersection operation to accelerate SLCA and ELCAcomputation. In essence; the problem of SLCA and ELCA computation becomes finding aset of common nodes that appear in all inverted lists and checking their satisfiability. Weshow that any existing set intersection algorithms can be adopted for SLCA and ELCAcomputation; and our optimization techniques can be used together with any existing searchmethod to improve the overall performance. Experiments verify that the performance of ourmethods outperforms existing methods by more than 2 orders of magnitude in most cases.,*,2011,*

Automatic XML Keyword Query Refinement,Zhifeng Bao; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Xiaofeng Meng,Existing XML keyword search methods focus on how to find relevant and meaningful datafragments for a keyword query; assuming each keyword is intended as part of it. However;user's queries usually contain irrelevant or mismatched terms; spelling errors etc; whichcauses the search results to be either empty or meaningless. In this paper; we introduce theproblem of automatic XML keyword query refinement; where automatic means the searchengine should be able to adaptively decide whether a query Q needs to be refined duringthe processing of Q; and at the same time find a list of promising refined query candidatesand their matching results over XML data; without any user interaction or a second try. Inorder to achieve this goal; we build a primary framework which consists of two core parts:(1)we build a novel query ranking model to evaluate the quality of a refined query RQ; which …,*,2009,*

Store and Use Provenance Information For Relational Query,Zhifeng Bao; Henning Koehler; Xiaofang Zhou; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract. In database querying; provenance information can help users understand wheredata comes from and how it is derived. Storing the provenance data is critical in the sensethat; the storage cost should be as small as possible and of fine granularity; and it shouldsupport the user query on provenance tracking efficiently as well. In this demo; we haveimplemented a relational database system prototype which can support SQL-like querywhile supporting provenance data recording during query execution. In particular; wepropose a tree structure to store provenance information and further propose variousreduction strategies to optimize its storage cost; we support the functionality of provenancedata tracking at tuple level for user queries in a visualized way.,*,*,*

모 SN: A CONCEPTUAL SCHEMA FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS,Zhifeng Bao; YC Tay; Jingbo Zhou,Abstract. The mushrooming of online social networks appears as unstoppable as the spreadof the Web. How should one manage and analyze their non-classical; sometimes huge andpossibly valuable datasets? A literature review shows that social network analyses oftenview a social network as a graph; store the data in textfiles and process them with ad hocsoftware. This is unsatisfactory. This paper starts with the thesis that a social network is morethan just a graph. For an alternative model; it presents a relational schema RSN. Throughthis schema; one can then exploit 30-odd years of progress in database technology for themanagement and analysis of social networks. The generality of RSN is demonstrated byinstantiating it for a sampling of services from Facebook; Twitter and other online socialnetworks; as well as for the author community in ACM Digital Library. Its power is also …,*,*,*
