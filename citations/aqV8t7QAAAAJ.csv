Distributed verification and hardness of distributed approximation,Atish Das Sarma; Stephan Holzer; Liah Kor; Amos Korman; Danupon Nanongkai; Gopal Pandurangan; David Peleg; Roger Wattenhofer,We study the verification problem in distributed networks; stated as follows. Let H be asubgraph of a network G where each vertex of G knows which edges incident on it are in H.We would like to verify whether H has some properties; eg; if it is a tree or if it is connected(every node knows at the end of the process whether H has the specified property or not).We would like to perform this verification in a decentralized fashion via a distributedalgorithm. The time complexity of verification is measured as the number of rounds ofdistributed communication. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of distributedverification and give almost tight lower bounds on the running time of distributed verificationalgorithms for many fundamental problems such as connectivity; spanning connectedsubgraph; and st cut verification. We then show applications of these results in deriving …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2012,165
What makes an image popular?,Aditya Khosla; Atish Das Sarma; Raffay Hamid,Abstract Hundreds of thousands of photographs are uploaded to the internet every minutethrough various social networking and photo sharing platforms. While some images getmillions of views; others are completely ignored. Even from the same users; differentphotographs receive different number of views. This begs the question: What makes aphotograph popular? Can we predict the number of views a photograph will receive evenbefore it is uploaded? These are some of the questions we address in this work. Weinvestigate two key components of an image that affect its popularity; namely the imagecontent and social context. Using a dataset of about 2.3 million images from Flickr; wedemonstrate that we can reliably predict the normalized view count of images with a rankcorrelation of 0.81 using both image content and social cues. In this paper; we show the …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,2014,144
Estimating pagerank on graph streams,Atish Das Sarma; Sreenivas Gollapudi; Rina Panigrahy,Abstract This article focuses on computations on large graphs (eg; the web-graph) where theedges of the graph are presented as a stream. The objective in the streaming model is touse small amount of memory (preferably sub-linear in the number of nodes n) and a smallernumber of passes. In the streaming model; we show how to perform several graphcomputations including estimating the probability distribution after a random walk of length l;the mixing time M; and other related quantities such as the conductance of the graph. Byapplying our algorithm for computing probability distribution on the web-graph; we canestimate the PageRank p of any node up to an additive error of &sqrt; ε p+ ε in Õ (&sqrt; M/α)passes and Õ (min (nα+ 1/ε&sqrt; M/α+(1/ε) Mα; α n&sqrt; Mα+(1/ε) &sqrt; M/α)) space; for anyα &in;(0; 1].

Personalized social recommendations: accurate or private,Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Aleksandra Korolova; Atish Das Sarma,Abstract With the recent surge of social networks such as Facebook; new forms ofrecommendations have become possible--recommendations that rely on one's socialconnections in order to make personalized recommendations of ads; content; products; andpeople. Since recommendations may use sensitive information; it is speculated that theserecommendations are associated with privacy risks. The main contribution of this work is informalizing trade-offs between accuracy and privacy of personalized socialrecommendations. We study whether" social recommendations"; or recommendations thatare solely based on a user's social network; can be made without disclosing sensitive linksin the social graph. More precisely; we quantify the loss in utility when existingrecommendation algorithms are modified to satisfy a strong notion of privacy; called …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,131
eTrust: Understanding trust evolution in an online world,Jiliang Tang; Huiji Gao; Huan Liu; Atish Das Sarma,Abstract Most existing research about online trust assumes static trust relations betweenusers. As we are informed by social sciences; trust evolves as humans interact. Little workexists studying trust evolution in an online world. Researching online trust evolution facesunique challenges because more often than not; available data is from passive observation.In this paper; we leverage social science theories to develop a methodology that enablesthe study of online trust evolution. In particular; we propose a framework of evolution trust;eTrust; which exploits the dynamics of user preferences in the context of online productreview. We present technical details about modeling trust evolution; and performexperiments to show how the exploitation of trust evolution can help improve theperformance of online applications such as rating and trust prediction.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,107
A sketch-based distance oracle for web-scale graphs,Atish Das Sarma; Sreenivas Gollapudi; Marc Najork; Rina Panigrahy,Abstract We study the fundamental problem of computing distances between nodes in largegraphs such as the web graph and social networks. Our objective is to be able to answerdistance queries between pairs of nodes in real time. Since the standard shortest pathalgorithms are expensive; our approach moves the time-consuming shortest-pathcomputation offline; and at query time only looks up precomputed values and performssimple and fast computations on these precomputed values. More specifically; during theoffline phase we compute and store a small" sketch" for each node in the graph; and atquery-time we look up the sketches of the source and destination nodes and perform asimple computation using these two sketches to estimate the distance.,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,107
PyCUDA: GPU run-time code generation for high-performance computing,Andreas Klöckner; Nicolas Pinto; Yunsup Lee; Bryan Catanzaro; Paul Ivanov; Ahmed Fasih; AD Sarma; D Nanongkai; G Pandurangan; P Tetali,Abstract High-performance scientific computing has recently seen a surge of interest inheterogeneous systems; with an emphasis on modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).These devices offer tremendous potential for performance and efficiency in important large-scale applications of computational science. However; exploiting this potential can bechallenging; as one must adapt to the specialized and rapidly evolving computingenvironment currently exhibited by GPUs. One way of addressing this challenge is toembrace better techniques and develop tools tailored to their needs. This article presentsone simple technique; GPU run-time code generation (RTCG); and PyCUDA; an open-source toolkit that supports this technique. In introducing PyCUDA; this article proposes thecombination of a dynamic; high-level scripting language with the massive performance of …,Arxiv preprint arXiv,2009,95
Ranking mechanisms in twitter-like forums,Anish Das Sarma; Atish Das Sarma; Sreenivas Gollapudi; Rina Panigrahy,Abstract We study the problem of designing a mechanism to rank items in forums by makinguse of the user reviews such as thumb and star ratings. We compare mechanisms whereforum users rate individual posts and also mechanisms where the user is asked to perform apairwise comparison and state which one is better. The main metric used to evaluate amechanism is the ranking accuracy vs the cost of reviews; where the cost is measured as theaverage number of reviews used per post. We show that for many reasonable probabilitymodels; there is no thumb (or star) based ranking mechanism that can produceapproximately accurate rankings with bounded number of reviews per item. On the otherhand we provide a review mechanism based on pairwise comparisons which achievesapproximate rankings with bounded cost. We have implemented a system; shoutvelocity …,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,80
Fast distributed pagerank computation,Atish Das Sarma; Anisur Rahaman Molla; Gopal Pandurangan; Eli Upfal,Abstract Over the last decade; PageRank has gained importance in a wide range ofapplications and domains; ever since it first proved to be effective in determining nodeimportance in large graphs (and was a pioneering idea behind Google's search engine). Indistributed computing alone; PageRank vector; or more generally random walk basedquantities have been used for several different applications ranging from determiningimportant nodes; load balancing; search; and identifying connectivity structures.Surprisingly; however; there has been little work towards designing provably efficient fully-distributed algorithms for computing PageRank. The difficulty is that traditional matrix–vectormultiplication style iterative methods may not always adapt well to the distributed settingowing to communication bandwidth restrictions and convergence rates.

Multi-skill collaborative teams based on densest subgraphs,Amita Gajewar; Atish Das Sarma,Abstract We consider the problem of identifying a team of skilled individuals forcollaboration; in the presence of a social network; with the goal to maximize thecollaborative compatibility of the team. Each node in the social network is associated withskills; and edge-weights specify affinity between respective nodes. We measurecollaborative compatibility objective as the density of the induced subgraph on selectednodes. This problem is NP-hard even when the team requires individuals of only one skill.We present a 3-approximation algorithm for the single-skill team formulation problem. Weshow the same approximation can be extended to a special case of multiple skills. Ourproblem generalizes the formulation studied by Lappas et al.[KDD′ 09] who measure teamcompatibility in terms of diameter or spanning tree. The experimental results show that the …,*,2012,69
Regret-minimizing representative databases,Danupon Nanongkai; Atish Das Sarma; Ashwin Lall; Richard J Lipton; Jun Xu,Abstract We propose the k-representative regret minimization query (k-regret) as anoperation to support multi-criteria decision making. Like top-k; the k-regret query assumesthat users have some utility or scoring functions; however; it never asks the users to providesuch functions. Like skyline; it filters out a set of interesting points from a potentially largedatabase based on the users' criteria; however; it never overwhelms the users by outputtingtoo many tuples. In particular; for any number k and any class of utility functions; the k-regretquery outputs k tuples from the database and tries to minimize the maximum regret ratio.This captures how disappointed a user could be had she seen k representative tuplesinstead of the whole database. We focus on the class of linear utility functions; which iswidely applicable.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,49
Randomized multi-pass streaming skyline algorithms,Atish Das Sarma; Ashwin Lall; Danupon Nanongkai; Jun Xu,Abstract We consider external algorithms for skyline computation without pre-processing.Our goal is to develop an algorithm with a good worst case guarantee while performing wellon average. Due to the nature of disks; it is desirable that such algorithms access the inputas a stream (even if in multiple passes). Using the tools of randomness; proved to be usefulin many applications; we present an efficient multi-pass streaming algorithm; RAND; forskyline computation. As far as we are aware; RAND is the first randomized skyline algorithmin the literature. RAND is near-optimal for the streaming model; which we prove via a simplelower bound. Additionally; our algorithm is distributable and can handle partially ordereddomains on each attribute. Finally; we demonstrate the robustness of RAND via extensiveexperiments on both real and synthetic datasets. RAND is comparable to the existing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,42
Arrival and departure dynamics in social networks,Shaomei Wu; Atish Das Sarma; Alex Fabrikant; Silvio Lattanzi; Andrew Tomkins,Abstract In this paper; we consider the natural arrival and departure of users in a socialnetwork; and ask whether the dynamics of arrival; which have been studied in some depth;also explain the dynamics of departure; which are not as well studied. Through study of theDBLP co-authorship network and a large online social network; we show that the dynamicsof departure behave differently from the dynamics of formation. In particular; the probabilityof departure of a user with few friends may be understood most accurately as a function ofthe raw number of friends who are active. For users with more friends; however; theprobability of departure is best predicted by the overall fraction of the user's neighborhoodthat is active; independent of size. We then study global properties of the sub-graphsinduced by active and inactive users; and show that active users tend to belong to a core …,Proceedings of the sixth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2013,40
Representative skylines using threshold-based preference distributions,Atish Das Sarma; Ashwin Lall; Danupon Nanongkai; Richard J Lipton; Jim Xu,The study of skylines and their variants has received considerable attention in recent years.Skylines are essentially sets of most interesting (undominated) tuples in a database.However; since the skyline is often very large; much research effort has been devoted toidentifying a smaller subset of (say k)“representative skyline” points. Several differentdefinitions of representative skylines have been considered. Most of these formulations areintuitive in that they try to achieve some kind of clustering “spread” over the entire skyline;with k points. In this work; we take a more principled approach in defining the representativeskyline objective. One of our main contributions is to formulate the problem of displaying krepresentative skyline points such that the probability that a random user would click on oneof them is maximized. Two major research questions arise naturally from this formulation …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,38
A tight unconditional lower bound on distributed randomwalk computation,Danupon Nanongkai; Atish Das Sarma; Gopal Pandurangan,Abstract We consider the problem of performing a random walk in a distributed network.Given bandwidth constraints; the goal of the problem is to minimize the number of roundsrequired to obtain a random walk sample. Das Sarma et al.[PODC'10] show that a randomwalk of length l on a network of diameter D can be performed in Õ (√{l D}+ D) time. A majorquestion left open is whether there exists a faster algorithm; especially whether themultiplication of√{l} and√{D} is necessary. In this paper; we show a tight unconditionallower bound on the time complexity of distributed random walk computation. Specifically; weshow that for any n; D; and D≤ l≤(n/(D 3 log n)) 1/4; performing a random walk of length Θ(l) on an n-node network of diameter D requires Ω (√{lD}+ D) time. This bound isunconditional; ie; it holds for any (possibly randomized) algorithm.

Generic Text Summarization Using WordNet.,Kedar Bellare; Anish Das Sarma; Atish Das Sarma; Navneet Loiwal; Vaibhav Mehta; Ganesh Ramakrishnan; Pushpak Bhattacharyya,Abstract This paper presents a WordNet based approach to text summarization. Thedocument to be summarized is used to extract a “relevant” sub-graph from the WordNetgraph. Weights are assigned to each node of this sub-graph using a strategy similar to theGoogle Pageranking algorithm. These weights capture the relevance of the respectivesynsets with respect to the whole document. A matrix in which each row repesents asentence and each column a node of the sub-graph (ie; a synset) is created. PrincipalComponent Analysis is performed on this matrix to help extract the sentences for thesummary. Our approach is generic unlike most previous approaches which address specificgenres of documents like news articles and biographies.

Efficient distributed random walks with applications,Atish Das Sarma; Danupon Nanongkai; Gopal Pandurangan; Prasad Tetali,Abstract We focus on the problem of performing random walks efficiently in a distributednetwork. Given bandwidth constraints; the goal is to minimize the number of rounds requiredto obtain a random walk sample. We first present a fast sublinear time distributed algorithmfor performing random walks whose time complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk.Our algorithm performs a random walk of length l in Õ (√ l D) rounds (with high probability)on an undirected network; where D is the diameter of the network. This improves over theprevious best algorithm that ran in Õ (l 2/3 D 1/3) rounds (Das Sarma et al.; PODC 2009). Wefurther extend our algorithms to efficiently perform k independent random walks in Õ (√ klD+ k) rounds.

Bypass rates: reducing query abandonment using negative inferences,Atish Das Sarma; Sreenivas Gollapudi; Samuel Ieong,Abstract We introduce a new approach to analyzing click logs by examining both thedocuments that are clicked and those that are bypassed-documents returned higher in theordering of the search results but skipped by the user. This approach complements thepopular click-through rate analysis; and helps to draw negative inferences in the click logs.We formulate a natural objective that finds sets of results that are unlikely to be collectivelybypassed by a typical user. This is closely related to the problem of reducing queryabandonment. We analyze a greedy approach to optimizing this objective; and establishtheoretical guarantees of its performance. We evaluate our approach on a large set ofqueries; and demonstrate that it compares favorably to the maximal marginal relevanceapproach on a number of metrics including mean average precision and mean reciprocal …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,25
On the embeddability of random walk distances,Xiaohan Zhao; Adelbert Chang; Atish Das Sarma; Haitao Zheng; Ben Y Zhao,Abstract Analysis of large graphs is critical to the ongoing growth of search engines andsocial networks. One class of queries centers around node affinity; often quantified byrandom-walk distances between node pairs; including hitting time; commute time; andpersonalized PageRank (PPR). Despite the potential of these" metrics;" they are rarely; ifever; used in practice; largely due to extremely high computational costs. In this paper; weinvestigate methods to scalably and efficiently compute random-walk distances; by"embedding" graphs and distances into points and distances in geometric coordinate spaces.We show that while existing graph coordinate systems (GCS) can accurately estimateshortest path distances; they produce significant errors when embedding random-walkdistances.

Interactive regret minimization,Danupon Nanongkai; Ashwin Lall; Atish Das Sarma; Kazuhisa Makino,Abstract We study the notion of regret ratio proposed in [19] Nanongkai et al.[VLDB10] todeal with multi-criteria decision making in database systems. The regret minimization queryproposed in [19] Nanongkai et al. was shown to have features of both skyline and top-k: itdoes not need information from the user but still controls the output size. While this approachis suitable for obtaining a reasonably small regret ratio; it is still open whether one can makethe regret ratio arbitrarily small. Moreover; it remains open whether reasonable questionscan be asked to the users in order to improve efficiency of the process. In this paper; westudy the problem of minimizing regret ratio when the system is enhanced with interaction.We assume that when presented with a set of tuples the user can tell which tuple is mostpreferred. Under this assumption; we develop the problem of interactive regret …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,16
Best-order streaming model,Atish Das Sarma; Richard J Lipton; Danupon Nanongkai,Abstract We study a new model of computation; called best-order stream; for graphproblems. Roughly; it is a proof system where a space-limited verifier has to verify a proofsequentially (ie; it reads the proof as a stream). Moreover; the proof itself is just a specificordering of the input data. This model is closely related to many models of computation inother areas such as data streams; communication complexity; and proof checking; and couldbe used in applications such as cloud computing. In this paper we focus on graph problemswhere the input is a sequence of edges. We show that even under this model; checkingsome basic graph properties deterministically requires linear space in the number of nodes.We also show that; in contrast with this; randomized verifiers are powerful enough to checkmany graph properties in polylogarithmic space.,Theoretical Computer Science,2011,16

Edge-preserving self-healing: keeping network backbones densely connected,Atish Das Sarma; Amitabh Trehan,Healing algorithms play a crucial part in distributed peer-to-peer networks where failuresoccur continuously and frequently. Whereas there are approaches for robustness that relylargely on built-in redundancy; we adopt a responsive approach that is more akin to that ofbiological networks eg the brain. The general goal of self-healing distributed graphs is tomaintain certain network properties while recovering from failure quickly and makingbounded alterations locally. Several self-healing algorithms have been suggested in therecent literature [IPDPS'08; PODC'08; PODC'09; PODC'11]; they heal various networkproperties while fulfilling competing requirements such as having low degree increase whilemaintaining connectivity; expansion and low stretch of the network.

Sparse cut projections in graph streams,Atish Das Sarma; Sreenivas Gollapudi; Rina Panigrahy,Abstract Finding sparse cuts is an important tool for analyzing large graphs that arise inpractice; such as the web graph; online social communities; and VLSI circuits. When dealingwith such graphs having billions of nodes; it is often hard to visualize global partitions. Whilestudies on sparse cuts have traditionally looked at cuts with respect to all the nodes in thegraph; some recent works analyze graph properties projected onto a small subset of verticesthat may be of interest in a given context; eg; relevant documents to a query in a searchengine. In this paper; we study how sparse cuts in a graph partition a certain subset ofnodes. We call this partition a cut projection. We study the problem of finding cut projectionsin the streaming model that is appropriate in this context as the input graph is too large tostore in main memory. Specifically; for ad-regular graph G on n nodes with a cut of …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2009,15

Each advertiser has its ownadvertising budget and a fixed amount they are willing to pay for each user that adopts theirproduct or shares their ads.

Our first contribution is a rigorous framework for the design and analysis ofdistributed random walk algorithms in dynamic networks. We then develop a fast distributedrandom-walk based algorithm that runs in O˜(τ Φ) rounds 2 (with high probability); where τ isthe dynamic mixing time and Φ is the dynamic diameter of the network; respectively; and …,Theoretical Computer Science,2015,8
Public advertisement broker markets,Atish Das Sarma; Deeparnab Chakrabarty; Sreenivas Gollapudi,Abstract Motivated by the growth of various networked systems as potential market places;we study market models wherein; owing to the size of the markets; transactions take placebetween largely unknown agents. In such scenarios; intermediaries or brokers play asignificant role in a transaction. We analyze market behavior in large networks wherein allsellers are not known to the buyers and vice-versa and depend on intermediaries to conductany transactions. In such markets; we study a specific case where buyers wish to purchasegoods from trusted sources at minimal prices. Sellers wish to maximize selling price. Brokersattempt to maximize profit by aiding in trade by acting as intermediaries; brokers have anadvertising budget. We show the existence of competitive equilibria in such layered brokermarkets. We also describe efficient algorithms to compute these equilibria. We give …,International Workshop on Web and Internet Economics,2007,8
Algorithms for message ferrying on mobile ad hoc networks,Mostafa Ammar; Deeparnab Chakrabarty; Atish Das Sarma; Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram; Richard J Lipton,Abstract Message Ferrying is a mobility assisted technique for working around thedisconnectedness and sparsity of Mobile ad hoc networks. One of the importantquestionswhich arise in this context is to determine the routing of the ferry; so as to minimize thebuffers used to store data at the nodes in thenetwork. We introduce a simple model tocapture the ferry routingproblem. We characterize {\em stable} solutions of the systemandprovide efficient approximation algorithms for the {\sc Min-Max Buffer Problem} for thecase when the nodes are onhierarchically separated metric spaces.,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2009,7
Distributed computation of sparse cuts via random walks,Atish Das Sarma; Anisur Rahaman Molla; Gopal Pandurangan,Abstract A sparse cut of a graph is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint subsets suchthat the ratio of the number of edges across the two subsets divided by the sum of degrees ofvertices in the smaller side is minimum. Finding sparse cuts is an important tool in analyzinglarge-scale distributed networks such as the Internet and Peer-to-Peer networks; as well aslarge-scale graphs such as the web graph; online social communities; and VLSI circuits.Sparse cuts are useful in graph clustering and partitioning among numerous otherapplications.

Dense subgraphs on dynamic networks,Atish Das Sarma; Ashwin Lall; Danupon Nanongkai; Amitabh Trehan,Abstract In distributed networks; it is often useful for the nodes to be aware of densesubgraphs; eg; such a dense subgraph could reveal dense substructures in otherwisesparse graphs (eg the World Wide Web or social networks); these might reveal communityclusters or dense regions for possibly maintaining good communication infrastructure. In thiswork; we address the problem of self-awareness of nodes in a dynamic network with regardsto graph density; ie; we give distributed algorithms for maintaining dense subgraphs that themember nodes are aware of. The only knowledge that the nodes need is that of the dynamicdiameter D; ie; the maximum number of rounds it takes for a message to traverse thedynamic network. For our work; we consider a model where the number of nodes are fixed;but a powerful adversary can add or remove a limited number of edges from the network …,International Symposium on Distributed Computing,2012,5
Estimating rank on graph streams,*,The rank of nodes in a graph may be inferred from a calculated probability that each node inthe graph appears in a single random walk of the graph. Short random walks may begenerated for each node in the graph. The generated random walks may be combined toform a longer single random walk. Multiple single random walks may be generated in thisfashion. The probability of each node appearing in a single random may be calculated fromthe generated single random walks. The rank of each node may then be inferred from thecalculated probabilities.,*,2011,5
Beyond modeling private actions: predicting social shares,Si Si; Atish Das Sarma; Elizabeth F Churchill; Neel Sundaresan,Abstract We study the problem of predicting sharing behavior from e-commerce sites tofriends on social networks via share widgets. The contextual variation in an action that isprivate (like rating a movie on Netflix); to one shared with friends online (like sharing an itemon Facebook); to one that is completely public (like commenting on a Youtube video)introduces behavioral differences that pose interesting challenges. In this paper; we showthat users' interests manifest in actions that spill across different types of channels such assharing; browsing; and purchasing. This motivates leveraging all such signals available fromthe e-commerce platform. We show that carefully incorporating signals from theseinteractions significantly improves share prediction accuracy.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,3

Efficient distributed computation of distance sketches in networks,Atish Das Sarma; Michael Dinitz; Gopal Pandurangan,Abstract Distance computation (eg; computing shortest paths) is one of the mostfundamental primitives used in communication networks. The cost of effectively andaccurately computing pairwise network distances can become prohibitive in large-scalenetworks such as the Internet and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The idea behind distancesketches is to preprocess the graph and store a small amount of information (called assketch or distance label) such that whenever a query for any pairwise distance is issued; thedistance can be well approximated (ie; with small stretch) very quickly in an online fashion.Specifically; the pre-processing (usually) involves storing this sketch with each node; suchthat at query time only the sketches of the concerned nodes need to be looked up tocompute the approximate distance.

The expression gap: do you like what you share?,Atish Das Sarma; Si Si; Elizabeth F Churchill; Neel Sundaresan,Abstract While recommendation profiles increasingly leverage social actions such as"shares"; the predictive significance of such actions is unclear. To what extent do publicshares correlate with other online behaviors such as searches; views and purchases?Based on an analysis of 950;000 users' behavioral; transactional; and social sharing data ona global online commerce platform; we show that social" shares"; or publicly postedexpressions of interest do not correlate with non-public behaviors such as views andpurchases. A key takeaway is that there is a" gap" between public and non-public actionsonline; suggesting that marketers and advertisers need to be cautious in their estimation ofthe significance of social sharing.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,2

Brief announcement: maintaining large dense subgraphs on dynamic networks,Atish Das Sarma; Ashwin Lall; Danupon Nanongkai; Amitabh Trehan,Abstract In distributed networks; some groups of nodes may have more inter-connections;perhaps due to their larger bandwidth availability or communication requirements.

Finding dense subgraphs in G (n; 1/2),Atish Das Sarma; Amit Deshpande; Ravi Kannan,Abstract Finding the largest clique in random graphs is a well known hard problem. It isknown that a random graph G (n; 1/2) almost surely has a clique of size about 2log n. Asimple greedy algorithm finds a clique of size log n; and it is a long-standing open problemto find a clique of size (1+ ε) log n in randomized polynomial time. In this paper; we study thegeneralization of finding the largest subgraph of any given edge density. We show that asimple modification of the greedy algorithm finds a subset of 2log n vertices with inducededge density at least 0.951. We also show that almost surely there is no subset of 2.784 logn vertices whose induced edge density is at least 0.951.,International Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms,2009,1
Distributed streaming: The power of communication,Artish Das Sarma; Richard J Lipton; Danupon Nanongkai,Abstract. Managing distributed data streams has become an important issue in this era ofmassive data and cloud computing. Several models have been proposed for the study ofalgorithms dealing with such data. Most applications use some variant of a distributedstreaming architecture; where data is aggregated on a tree from leaf nodes receiving theinputs; such a model; MUD was formally defined in Feldman et. al. SODA'08. The nodesnever communicate and the root outputs the solution. The simplicity and power of suchmodels make them popular; particularly in programming paradigms such as MapReduce;Dryad; Hadoop.

On-line algorithms for market equilibria,Spyros Angelopoulos; Atish Das Sarma; Avner Magen; Anastasios Viglas,Abstract We consider a variation of the classical problem of finding prices which guaranteeequilibrium in linear markets consisting of divisible goods and agents with money.Specifically; we consider on-line algorithms for this problem in which goods are consideredon-line; and each good is assigned an irrevocable price. Since exact equilibria will not befound in such a setting; we appeal to the concept of approximate equilibrium defined inprevious studies of the problem; to characterize the quality of our solutions. We considerboth deterministic and randomized algorithms for finding approximate equilibria. We prove atight bound on the performance of deterministic algorithms; and show that under certainnatural conditions; randomized algorithms lead to market prices which are closer toequilibrium.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,2005,1

An Approximate Restatement of the Four-Color Theorem.,Atish Das Sarma; Amita Gajewar; Richard J Lipton; Danupon Nanongkai,Abstract The celebrated Four-Color Theorem was first conjectured in the 1850's. Since thenthere had been many partial results. More than a century later; it was first proved by Appeland Haken [1] and then subsequently improved by Robertson et al.[8]. These proofs makeextensive use of computer for various computations involved. In mathematical community;there continues to be an interest for a proof that is theoretical in nature. Our result providesan interesting restatement of the Four-Color Theorem that requires only approximatecolorings. Tait proved in 1880 [11] that the Four-Color Theorem is equivalent to showing thattwo-edge connected; cubic; planar graphs have edge 3-colorings. Our main result is that thiscan be weakened to show that if there exists an approximate edge 3-coloring for thesegraphs; then the Four-Color Theorem is true.,J. Graph Algorithms Appl.,2013,*

We extend the work [6] from computing single random walk tomultiple random walks. In the work [6]; they did not consider message complexity-the totalnumber of messages exchanged and their algorithm is expensive in this aspect. Here weshow that the average messages used for single random walk is much less than them. Intheir paper they compute η short walks for each nodes of the network and then stitch themtogether to compute a random walk of length l. Now the basic question is how many walks oflength l can be compute using the same set of short length walks. In other words; how manyshort length walks we can use for multiple random walks. And we show that a good amountof short walks are going used; infact we show a constant fraction of short walks are going …,*,*,*
