Lipid-like material as the source of the uncharacterized organic carbon in the ocean?,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel,The composition and formation mechanisms of the uncharacterized fraction of oceanicparticulate organic carbon (POC) are not well understood. We isolated biologically importantcompound classes and the acid-insoluble fraction; a proxy of the uncharacterized fraction;from sinking POC in the deep Northeast Pacific and measured carbon isotope ratios toconstrain the source (s) of the uncharacterized fraction. Stable carbon and radiocarbonisotope signatures of the acid-insoluble fraction were similar to those of the lipid fraction;implying that the acid-insoluble fraction might be composed of selectively accumulated lipid-like macromolecules.,Science,2003,72
Biological pump processes in the cryopelagic and hemipelagic Arctic Ocean: Canada Basin and Chukchi Rise,Susumu Honjo; Richard A Krishfield; Timothy I Eglinton; Steven J Manganini; John N Kemp; Kenneth Doherty; Jeomshik Hwang; Theresa K McKee; Takatoshi Takizawa,Abstract The object of this study was to clarify the characteristics of the biological pumpsystem operating in permanently or seasonally ice-covered ocean (cryopelagic) conditionsby examining the export of particulate organic carbon (POC) and other components ofoceanic particles in the Canada Basin at 120; 200; and 3067 m and in hemipelagic ChukchiRise waters at 120 m. The first time-series sediment trap (TS-trap); B96-200m; was tetheredto an Ice Ocean Environmental Buoy (IOEB) and deployed at 79.1° N; 132.2° E in March1996; it was recovered in July 1997 at 76.7° N; 131.8° E; having drifted exclusively in thecryopelagic environment.

Sedimentary rocks as sources of ancient organic carbon to the ocean: An investigation through Δ14C and δ13C signatures of organic compound classes,Tomoko Komada; Ellen RM Druffel; Jeomshik Hwang,Abstract [1] Chemical and isotopic variability of particulate organic carbon (POC) wasexamined in samples from the Santa Clara River watershed and adjacent shelf toinvestigate the processing of fossil POC derived from bedrock. The Santa Clara is a smallcoastal river that drains mountainous terrain in southern California; United States. Organiccarbon in shale; river suspended sediment; and coastal marine sediment was separated intothree operationally defined organic compound classes: total extractable lipids; acidhydrolyzable material; and the nonhydrolyzable residue. In all samples; the nonhydrolyzablefraction was dominant (∼ 50% of POC); while lipids and acid hydrolyzable moieties wererelatively minor (≤ 22 and≤ 13%; respectively). The Δ 14 C and δ 13 C signatures of theisolated fractions varied dramatically; not only across different sample types; but also for a …,Global biogeochemical cycles,2005,51
Widespread influence of resuspended sediments on oceanic particulate organic carbon: Insights from radiocarbon and aluminum contents in sinking particles,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel; Timothy I Eglinton,Abstract [1] Particulate organic carbon (POC) in the ocean often exhibits more depletedradiocarbon contents (lower Δ 14 C values) than expected if its sole source were POCrecently synthesized by primary production and export from the overlying surface waters. Anexamination of available Δ 14 C data sets for sinking POC show that this phenomenon isboth common and globally widespread. Also; a strong correlation is found to exist between Δ14 C values of organic carbon and aluminum content in sinking particles that is consistentover a range of oceanic settings.

Transport of organic carbon from the California coast to the slope region: A study of Δ14C and δ13C signatures of organic compound classes,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel; Tomoko Komada,Abstract [1] Surface sediments along a transect from an abyssal site in the northeasternPacific (Station M; 34 50′ N; 123 00′ W) to a small mountainous river on the Californiacoast (Santa Clara River) were studied to investigate the sources and cycling of organicmatter on the continental margin. Sediment samples were separated into organic compoundfractions (extractable lipids; amino acids (THAA); carbohydrates (TCHO); and the acid-insoluble fraction); and their carbon isotope ratios were measured. The Δ 14 C values of allthe THAA and TCHO fractions were greater than− 100‰; indicating relatively modernorganic carbon (OC) source (s); and rapid cycling of these fractions. In contrast; the Δ 14 Cvalues of extractable lipids and the acid-insoluble fraction were distinctly lower than those ofthe THAA and TCHO fractions.

Incorporation of aged dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by oceanic particulate organic carbon (POC): an experimental approach using natural carbon isotopes,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel; James E Bauer,Abstract Incorporation of 14 C-depleted (old) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on/intoparticulate organic carbon (POC) has been suggested as a possible mechanism to explainthe low Δ 14 C-POC values observed in the deep ocean [Druffel; ERM; Williams; PM; 1990.Identification of a deep marine source of particulate organic carbon using bomb 14 C.Nature; 347; 172–174.]. A shipboard incubation experiment was performed in the SargassoSea to test this hypothesis. Finely ground dried plankton was incubated in seawater samplesfrom the deep Sargasso Sea; both with and without a biological poison (HgCl 2). Changes inparameters such as biochemical composition and carbon isotopic signatures of bulk POCand its organic compound classes were examined to study the roles of sorptive processesand biotic activity on POC character.

Lateral organic carbon supply to the deep Canada Basin,Jeomshik Hwang; Timothy I Eglinton; Richard A Krishfield; Steven J Manganini; Susumu Honjo,Abstract [1] Understanding the processes driving the carbon cycle in the Arctic Ocean isimportant for assessing the impacts of the predicted rapid and amplified climate change inthis region. We analyzed settling particle samples intercepted by a time-series sediment trapdeployed in the abyssal Canada Basin (at 3067 m) in order to examine carbon export to thedeep Arctic Ocean. Strikingly old radiocarbon ages (apparent mean 14 C age=∼ 1900years) of the organic carbon; abundant lithogenic material (∼ 80%); and mass fluxvariations temporally decoupled from the cycle of primary productivity in overlying surfacewaters together suggest that; unlike other ocean basins; the majority of the particulateorganic carbon entering the deep Canada Basin is supplied from the surrounding margins.,Geophysical Research Letters,2008,31
Blank correction for Δ 14 C measurements in organic compound classes of oceanic particulate matter,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel,Abstract Contaminant carbon (blank carbon) was studied for its impact on the carbon isotopemeasurements (Δ 14 C and δ 13 C) of 3 organic compound classes of oceanic particulateorganic matter. Two methods of blank correction and associated uncertainties were studied.First; the carbon blanks were quantified manometrically and the isotope ratios of the blankcarbon were measured directly. Second; the isotope ratios of the blank carbon wereestimated using the standard dilution method from the difference in Δ 14 C values betweenunprocessed and processed standards. The 2 methods agreed within the uncertainties. Thestandard deviations of numerous Δ 14 C measurements made on processed standardcompounds were comparable to those of real samples. Blank correction using the standarddilution method is much less sensitive to the error in determination of blank carbon mass …,Radiocarbon,2005,23
High primary productivity and f-ratio in summer in the Ulleung basin of the East/Japan Sea,Jung Hyun Kwak; Jeomshik Hwang; Eun Jung Choy; Hyun Je Park; Dong-Jin Kang; Tongsup Lee; Kyung-Il Chang; Kyung-Ryul Kim; Chang-Keun Kang,Abstract To better understand the cause of high summer primary productivity in the UlleungBasin located in the southwest part of the East/Japan Sea; the spatial dynamics of primary;new; and regenerated productivities (PP; NP; and RP) were examined along the path of theTsushima Warm Current system in summer 2008. We compared hydrographic and chemicalparameters in the Ulleung Basin with those of the Kuroshio Current in the Western PacificOcean and the East China Sea. In summer; integrated primary productivity (IPP; 0.37–0.96 gC m− 2 d− 1) and integrated new productivity (INP; 26–221 mg N m− 2 d− 1) within theeuphotic zone in the Ulleung Basin were higher than those in the East China Sea and theWestern Pacific Ocean (0.17–0.28 g C m− 2 d− 1; 2− 5 mg N m− 2 d− 1; respectively).

Temporal variability of Δ14C; δ13C; and C/N in sinking particulate organic matter at a deep time series station in the northeast Pacific Ocean,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel; Sheila Griffin; Kenneth L Smith; Roberta J Baldwin; James E Bauer,Abstract [1] A 6-year time series of Δ 14 C; δ 13 C; and C/N measurements in deep sinkingparticulate organic matter (POM) is presented for an abyssal site; Station M in the northeastPacific Ocean. The Δ 14 C values revealed that sinking POM at 3450 m depth (650 m abovebottom) contained old carbon despite its presumed short transit time in the water column.The isotopic and chemical properties of the sinking POM varied with time and appear to becontrolled by more than one major process. In 1993; 1994; and late 1996; isotopicsignatures and C/N molar ratios indicate negligible or vertically homogeneous influence ofresuspended particles from the bottom or particles laterally transported from the margin tothe study site. However; during early 1995 and 1998; Δ 14 C values were lower than thoseduring other periods and C/N values at three deep depths were not equal; indicating that …,Global biogeochemical cycles,2004,21
Variability of monthly radiocarbon during the 1760s in corals from the Galapagos Islands,Ellen RM Druffel; Sheila Griffin; Jeomshik Hwang; Tomoko Komada; Steven R Beaupre; Kevin C Druffel-Rodriguez; Guaciara M Santos; John Southon,Abstract Radiocarbon (Δ 14 C) measurements of monthly samples from a Galapagossurface coral are among the first data sets from the new Keck Carbon Cycle AcceleratorMass Spectrometry laboratory at the University of California; Irvine. An average Δ 14 C valueof− 62 is obtained for 144 measurements of samples from monthly coral bands that livedfrom about AD 1760–1771 (±6 yr). High Δ 14 C values were found during January throughMarch; when upwelling was weak or absent at the Galapagos Islands. Low Δ 14 C valueswere obtained mid-year during strong upwelling. The average seasonal variability of Δ 14 Cwas 15–25; which is greater than that at other tropical and subtropical locations in the PacificOcean because of intense seasonal upwelling at this site. Periods of sustained high Δ 14 Cvalues were found during 1762–1763 and 1766. A spectral analysis revealed that the …,Radiocarbon,2004,21
Penetration of anthropogenic carbon into organic particles of the deep ocean,Ellen RM Druffel; James E Bauer; Sheila Griffin; Jeomshik Hwang,Abstract [1] In the late 1980s; bomb 14 C was present in suspended particulate organiccarbon (POC) from the North Central Pacific (NCP) and Sargasso Sea (SS) throughout mostof the water column; demonstrating that deep POC had exchanged with atmospheric CO 2 inthe past 30 years. Upon reoccupation of these sites in 1999 and 2000; respectively; weobserved that the δ 13 C values of suspended POC were lower than those measured adecade earlier. This demonstrates that anthropogenic CO 2 from fossil fuel and biomassburning has penetrated a major organic matter pool in the deep ocean. Δ 14 C measured inthe suspended POC showed similar or higher values in the deep Sargasso Sea anddecreased values in the deep NCP compared to those measured previously. We use a boxmodel to show that the differences in the radiocarbon results are likely due to the …,Geophysical research letters,2003,17
The air-sea exchange of CO2 in the East Sea (Japan Sea),Dong-Chan Oh; Mi-Kyung Park; Sang-Hwa Choi; Dong-Jin Kang; Sun Young Park; Jeom Shik Hwang; Andrey Andreev; Gi Hoon Hong; Kyung-Ryul Kim,Abstract During CREAMS expeditions; f CO 2 for surface waters was measured continuouslyalong the cruise tracks. The f CO 2 in surface waters in summer varied in the range 320–440µatm; showing moderate supersaturation with respect to atmospheric CO 2. In winter;however; f CO 2 showed under-saturation of CO 2 in most of the area; while varying in amuch wider range from 180 to 520 µatm. Some very high f CO 2 values observed in thenorthern East Sea (Japan Sea) appeared to be associated with the intensive convectionsystem developed in the area. A gas-exchange model was developed for describing theannual variation of f CO 2 and for estimating the annual flux of CO 2 at the air-sea interface.The model incorporated annual variations in SST; the thickness of the mixed layer; gasexchange associated with wind velocity; biological activity and atmospheric concentration …,Journal of oceanography,1999,16
Source (s) and cycling of the nonhydrolyzable organic fraction of oceanic particles,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel; Timothy I Eglinton; Daniel J Repeta,Abstract A major fraction of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the deep ocean remainsmolecularly uncharacterized. In an effort to determine the chemical characteristics andsource (s) of sinking POC; we studied a nonhydrolyzable fraction of sinking POC using 13 CNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis. 13 C NMRspectra and products from analytical pyrolysis of the nonhydrolyzable fraction exhibit astrongly aliphatic character that is distinct from that of bulk POC. The aliphatic nature of thisfraction is consistent with its low stable carbon isotope values. We hypothesize that thenonhydrolyzable fraction derives to a significant extent from a refractory component oforganisms that selectively accumulates; resulting in its manifestation as a major part of POCsinking to the deep ocean and in underlying sediments.,Geochimica et cosmochimica acta,2006,14
Dynamics of particle export on the Northwest Atlantic margin,Jeomshik Hwang; Steven J Manganini; Daniel B Montluçon; Timothy I Eglinton,Abstract The Northwest Atlantic margin is characterized by high biological productivity inshelf and slope surface waters. In addition to carbon supply to underlying sediments; thepersistent; intermediate depth nepheloid layers emanating from the continental shelves; andbottom nepheloid layers maintained by strong bottom currents associated with thesouthward flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC); provide conduits for export oforganic carbon over the margin and/or to the interior ocean. As a part of a project tounderstand dynamics of particulate organic carbon (POC) cycling in this region; weexamined the bulk and molecular properties of time-series sediment trap samples obtainedat 968 m; 1976 m; and 2938 m depths from a bottom-tethered mooring on the New Englandslope (water depth; 2988 m).

Dissolved inorganic radiocarbon in the North Pacific Ocean and Sargasso Sea,Ellen RM Druffel; James E Bauer; Sheila Griffin; Steven R Beaupré; Jeomshik Hwang,Abstract We present radiocarbon measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) indepth profiles from reoccupations of our central North Pacific Ocean and Sargasso Sea (SS)sites. From 1985 to 1999; an increase in Δ 14 C values of 6–17‰ was measured between1150 and 2400 m depth in the North Central Pacific. Natural changes in deep circulation arelikely responsible for variability of Δ 14 C signatures in the deep ocean; though we cannotrule out the presence of bomb 14 C at this depth range. Bomb 14 C had increased in thedeep SS from 1989 to 2000; this is the result of southward transport of North Atlantic DeepWater (NADW) to this site.,Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers,2008,12
Molecular and isotopic constraints on the sources of suspended particulate organic carbon on the northwestern Atlantic margin,Jeomshik Hwang; Daniel Montluçon; Timothy I Eglinton,Abstract The abundance; carbon isotopic composition (Δ 14 C and δ 13 C); and lipidbiomarker (alkenones and saturated fatty acids) distributions of suspended particulateorganic matter were investigated at three stations centered on the 2000; 3000; and 3500 misobaths over the New England slope in order to assess particulate carbon sources anddynamics in this highly productive and energetic region.

Biomagnification of persistent chlorinated and brominated contaminants in food web components of the Yellow Sea,Gyo-Hyuk Byun; Hyo-Bang Moon; Jung-Hwa Choi; Jeomshik Hwang; Chang-Keun Kang,Abstract Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); organochlorine pesticides(OCPs); and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were measured in 32 speciesinhabiting the Yellow Sea to assess their bioaccumulation potentials. The concentrations inthese samples were lower than those reported for other countries or locations. Relativelyhigh levels of BDE 209 in biota suggest an ongoing source of deca-BDE technical mixingwithin the Yellow Sea.

The major portion of the particle flux occurredduring the austral summer in January and February when sea ice concentration wasreduced to< 60%. Biogenic components; dominated by opal (~ 78% of the biogeniccomponents); accounted for over 75% of particle flux during this high-flux period. Thedominant source of sinking particles shifted from diatoms to soft-tissued organisms;evidenced by high particulate organic carbon (POC) content (> 30%) and a low bio-Si/POCratio (< 0.5) during the austral winter.

To find causes of the reportedly high primary productivity in summer in the EJS;especially in the UB; we measured primary productivity; phytoplankton composition; andother environmental variables. The water column was strongly stratified in the EJScompared with the Western Subarctic Pacific (WSP). Integrated primary productivity was twotimes higher in the EJS (612 mg C m− 2 d− 1) than in the WSP (291 mg C m− 2 d− 1). Thevertical distributions of physicochemical and biological factors confirmed that production inthe subsurface chlorophyll maximum layer in the study regions was an important factorregulating primary productivity within the water column.

Temporal and spatial variability of particle transport in the deep Arctic Canada Basin,Jeomshik Hwang; Minkyoung Kim; Steven J Manganini; Cameron P McIntyre; Negar Haghipour; JongJin Park; Richard A Krishfield; Robie W Macdonald; Fiona A McLaughlin; Timothy I Eglinton,Abstract To better understand the current carbon cycle and potentially detect its change inthe rapidly changing Arctic Ocean; we examined sinking particles collected quasi-continuously over a period of 7 years (2004–2011) by bottom-tethered sediment trapmoorings in the central Canada Basin. Total mass flux was very low (< 100 mg m− 2 d− 1) atall sites and was temporally decoupled from the cycle of primary production in surfacewaters. Extremely low radiocarbon contents of particulate organic carbon and highaluminum contents in sinking particles reveal high contributions of resuspended sediment tototal sinking particle flux in the deep Canada Basin.

Alkenones as tracers of surface ocean temperature and biological pump processes on the Northwest Atlantic margin,Jeomshik Hwang; Minkyoung Kim; JongJin Park; Steven J Manganini; Daniel B Montluçon; Timothy I Eglinton,Abstract We have examined alkenone distributions; specifically the temperature proxy U 37K′; in sinking particulate organic matter (POM) intercepted at three depths by time-seriessediment traps deployed between 2004 and 2007 on the Northwest Atlantic margin. Thegoal was to assess physical and biogeochemical processes acting upon alkenones duringpassage through the water column. U 37 K′ did not exhibit any systematic trend withincreasing depth despite several-fold attenuation in alkenone flux. Because of the extensivereduction in C 37 alkenone flux in the water column and more efficient alkenonedegradation during the period of high alkenone flux; the temperature bias toward that ofmore productive seasons was reduced with increasing trap depth. The temporal variation ofU 37 K′ and alkenone-derived temperature compared best with the satellite-derived …,Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers,2014,5
Variability of dissolved inorganic radiocarbon at a surface site in the Northeast Pacific Ocean,Ellen RM Druffel; Steven Beaupré; Sheila Griffin; Jeomshik Hwang,Abstract We report radiocarbon measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) insurface water samples collected daily during 12 cruises to Station M in the northeast Pacificoff central California. Individual surface Δ 14 C values ranged from 22‰ to 70‰ over 10 yr.Variability of average cruise values is highest during winter likely due to increased mixing. Ageneral decrease of Δ 14 C values was observed at a rate of about 3‰ per year between1994 and 2004; about half of that in atmospheric CO 2 during this period (Levin and Kromer2004). The Δ 14 C results ranged from 2–18‰ during individual cruises and were oftensignificantly larger than the total uncertainty for individual measurements (±3.9‰). Thisindicates that a single Δ 14 C result from a surface site is not sufficient to capture the truevariability of Δ 14 C in the surface ocean.,Radiocarbon,2010,4
Sedimentation of particulate organic carbon on the Amundsen Shelf; Antarctica,Minkyoung Kim; Jeomshik Hwang; Sang H Lee; Hyung J Kim; Dongseon Kim; Eun J Yang; SangHoon Lee,Abstract We examined the recent history of sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) accumulationon the western Amundsen Shelf; to help characterize the biological carbon pump in theAmundsen Sea; Antarctica. Vertical sedimentary profiles (in the upper 21-cm) of SOCcontent; radio-and stable-carbon isotopes were obtained at four locations in the westernAmundsen Sea: near the shelf break; inside the polynya near the Dotson Ice Shelf; and atboth the periphery and the center of the Amundsen Sea polynya. Profiles wererepresentative not only of various distances from the coast; but also of various summertimesea ice conditions and bottom depths. The SOC content (up to 1.1%) and the radiocarboncontent were distinctly higher at the periphery and at the center of the polynya than at theother sites.

Carbon isotope ratios of organic compound fractions in oceanic suspended particles,Jeomshik Hwang; Ellen RM Druffel,Abstract [1] To study cycling of organic fractions in the ocean; relative abundances and radio-and stable-carbon isotope measurements of total lipid extract; acid-soluble; and acid-insoluble fractions of suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) were made. Changes inrelative abundances occurred mostly in the upper 1000 m of the water column; with adecrease in total lipid extract and the acid-soluble fraction and an increase in the acid-insoluble fraction with increasing depth. We found lower Δ 14 C values for total lipid extractand the acid-insoluble fraction than for the acid-soluble fraction; which is consistent with theprevious suggestion of incorporation of dissolved organic carbon and/or resuspendedsediment to POC (Druffel and Williams; 1990; Sherrell et al.; 1998). The Δ 14 C values ofthese fractions in a given organic carbon pool must be understood in terms of acquisition …,Geophysical research letters,2006,3

The samples were collected for one year starting fromMarch 2011 using time-series sediment traps deployed at depths of 1040 m and 2280 m onbottom-tethered mooring at Station EC1 (37.33° N; 131.45° E; 2300 m water depth) in theUlleung Basin (UB); southwestern part of the East Sea. The temporal variation in theparticulate organic carbon (POC) flux at 1000 m shows a good relationship with the primaryproduction in the corresponding surface water. The ratio of POC flux at 1000 m to satellite-based primary production in the corresponding region in the UB was~ 3%; which iscomparable to the values of 2 to 5% estimated from previous studies of other part of the …,Journal of Marine Systems,2017,2
Evaluation of resuspended sediments to sinking particles by benthic disturbance in the Clarion-Clipperton nodule fields,Hyung Jeek Kim; Dongseon Kim; Kiseong Hyeong; Jeomshik Hwang; Chan Min Yoo; Dong Jin Ham; Inah Seo,The geochemical properties of sinking particles and sediments in the Clarion-ClippertonZone were examined to develop a quantitative indicator with which to evaluate thecontribution of sediment resuspended by nodule mining activity to sinking particles. The ratioof lithogenic material to organic carbon varies from∼ 3 in sinking particles to∼ 211 insediments. This ratio is easily measured and is not easily affected by degradation and/ordissolution in the water column. A mixing model indicates that the ratio may be used as apotential proxy for estimating the contribution of resuspended sediment derived from miningoperations to sinking particles.,Marine Georesources & Geotechnology,2015,2
Molecular and isotopic insights into particulate organic carbon sources and dynamics in Jordan Basin; Gulf of Maine,Jeomshik Hwang; Daniel B Montluçon; Cynthia H Pilskaln; Timothy I Eglinton,Abstract The carbon isotope and lipid biomarker composition of suspended particles andsurface sediment was measured to examine the impact of sediment supply; redistributionand post-depositional alteration processes on organic matter cycling in the Gulf of Maine; asemi-enclosed shelf sea in the northwest Atlantic. A beam attenuation profile revealed a> 50m-thick benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) in the Jordan Basin at the time of sampling (April2006). The relatively low radiocarbon content of suspended particulate organic carbon(POC) in the BNL indicates that up to 82% of the POC in this layer was supplied fromresuspension of sediment. The concentration of alkenones normalized to POC increasedwith increasing depth in the water column and was highest in the surface sediment. Incontrast to these markers of surface ocean photoautotrophy; the vertical profiles for the …,Continental Shelf Research,2013,2

Natural and Anthropogenic Carbon Cycling,Il-Nam Kim; Kitack Lee; Jeomshik Hwang,Abstract The East Sea (Japan Sea) is experiencing changes in water temperature; oxygencontent; and deep water circulation pattern. These changes; in turn; have affected and willcontinue to affect carbon cycling in the East Sea; directly and indirectly. As the physicaldynamics of the East Sea resembles that of the open ocean; studying inorganic and organiccarbon cycling in the East Sea may improve our understanding of global carbon cycling; andconsequently enable us to predict more accurately the response of the carbon cycle toglobal climate change. In our review of inorganic carbon cycling; we focus on the uptake ofanthropogenic carbon by the East Sea and the shoaling of the saturation depths of thearagonite and calcite caused by acidification. The saturation depths for aragonite and calcitein the East Sea have shoaled by about 80–220 and 500–700 m; respectively; compared …,*,2016,1
Evidence of minimal carbon sequestration in the productive Amundsen Sea polynya,SangHoon Lee; Jeomshik Hwang; Hugh W Ducklow; Doshik Hahm; Sang H Lee; Dongseon Kim; Jung‐Ho Hyun; Jisoo Park; Ho K Ha; Tae‐Wan Kim; Eun J Yang; Hyoung C Shin,Abstract The Amundsen Sea polynya (ASP) is reportedly the most productive among thecoastal polynyas around Antarctica. However; observational constraints limit ourunderstanding of the biological pump and carbon cycle in the ASP. We measured variouscarbon-related parameters such as primary production; bacterial production; sinking flux ofparticulate organic carbon (POC); and accumulation of organic carbon in the sediment aswell as hydrographic parameters during field observations and by instrument moorings.Over 95% of the photosynthetically produced POC was converted to suspended POC and/ordissolved carbon forms in the upper~ 400 m layer. We postulate that most of the carbontransported to the water column by the biological pump in the ASP was flushed out of theshelf without being sequestered for long-term storage in sediments.

Biological and physical controls on the flux and characteristics of sinking particles on the Northwest Atlantic margin,Jeomshik Hwang; Steven J Manganini; JongJin Park; Daniel B Montluçon; John M Toole; Timothy I Eglinton,Studies seeking to understand sinking particle flux and related biological carbon pumpusing time-series sediment trap moorings have been carried out at numerous locations (forexample; Honjo et al.; 2008; Turner; 2015). Many of these stations represent open oceanenvironments where particle flux is mainly controlled by production and export of biogenicparticles from the overlying surface ocean. Moreover; studies have mostly focused on theattenuation in flux; biogenic matter degradation; and remineralization during the verticaltransit of particles from surface to deep waters; as well as their sedimentation. While muchremains to be understood concerning the underlying mechanisms; these studies havehelped to develop the concept and advanced our understanding of the biological pump; andon its role in the ocean's ability to take up atmospheric CO2 (Turner; 2015).

Geochemical characteristics of sinking particles in the Tonga arc hydrothermal vent field; southwestern Pacific,Hyung Jeek Kim; Jonguk Kim; Sang Joon Pak; Se-Jong Ju; Chan Min Yoo; Hyun Sub Kim; Kyeong Yong Lee; Jeomshik Hwang,Abstract Studies of sinking particles associated with hydrothermal vent fluids may help us toquantify mass transformation processes between hydrothermal vent plumes and deposits.Such studies may also help us understand how various types of hydrothermal systemsinfluence particle flux and composition. However; the nature of particle precipitation out ofhydrothermal vent plumes in the volcanic arcs of convergent plate boundaries has not beenwell studied; nor have the characteristics of such particles been compared with thecharacteristics of sinking particles at divergent boundaries. We examined sinking particlescollected by sediment traps for about 10 days at two sites; each within 200 m of identifiedhydrothermal vents in the south Tonga arc of the southwestern Pacific. The total mass fluxwas several-fold higher than in the non-hydrothermal southwest tropical Pacific. The …,Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers,2016,*
Dynamics of Organic Carbon Flux on the Northwest Atlantic Margin: Results from a Three-year Time-Series Sediment Trap Study,J Hwang; SJ Manganini; DB Montlucon; TI Eglinton,Abstract Sinking particles have been collected on the Northwest Atlantic margin sincesummer 2004 to understand the dynamics of particle export and the role of the DeepWestern Boundary Current in resuspension of particles from sediment and their horizontaltransport. Three traps were deployed at roughly 1000m; 2000m; and 3000m (50 m abovethe bottom) on a mooring at 3000m isobath. The results from the 2004-2005 deploymenthave been published previously (Hwang et al.; 2009). We report the results from summer2004 to summer 2007 in this presentation.

Organic carbon export to the deep Canada Basin: Importance of lateral supply,J Hwang; TI Eglinton; SJ Manganini; RA Krishfield; DR Griffith; S Honjo; FA McLaughlin; RW MacDonald,Abstract Understanding the processes driving the carbon cycle in the Arctic Ocean is offundamental importance for assessing the impacts of the predicted climate change in thiscritical region. We analyzed sinking particle samples intercepted below the marginal icezone of the Beaufort Sea at a depth of 3067m (Station A; 75N; 150W) in the Canada Basinfrom 2004 to 2005 and from 2007 to 2009; in order to examine interannual variability incarbon export to the bathypelagic zone. Sinking particles were also collected at other depths-2000m and 3750m-at Station A and from other locations (Station B-78N; 150W; and StationD-74N; 140W) within the basin for the latter time period. Prior observations from the 2004-5study revealed that mass flux variations were temporally decoupled from the cycle of primaryproductivity in surface waters; and that sinking particle composition was characterized by …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2010,*

A Comparison of Particle and Organic Carbon Fluxes to the Deep Canada Basin Between 2004-2005 and 2007-2008,TI Eglinton; J Hwang; SJ Manganini; D Griffith; RA Krishfield; S Honjo,Abstract Two of the most blatant impacts of climate change in the Arctic are destabilization ofpermafrost soils; and a reduction in sea-ice cover; altering carbon cycling both on land andin the ocean. In particular; higher terrestrial carbon fluxes to the ocean; and both enhancedand an offshore extension of marine productivity; are anticipated. However; the fate of thiscarbon (ie; remineralization versus burial) in the Arctic Ocean; as well as the extent to whichthe deep basin waters and underlying sediments will sequester carbon in the face of rapidlychanging sea-ice; hydrographic and biogeochemical conditions; remain unknown. Answersto these questions are crucial to our understanding of whether the Arctic will serve as a netcarbon dioxide source or sink to the atmosphere; and how pelagic ecosystems will respondto these perturbations.

Lateral transport of Particulate Organic Carbon on the Northwest Atlantic Margin,J Hwang; TI Eglinton; D Montlucon; SJ Manganini,Abstract The Northwest Atlantic margin is a dynamic; high kinetic energy environmentcharacterized by vigorous near bottom currents that induce" benthic storms". Lateraltransport of fine resuspended particles from the Nova Scotian margin along the southwardflowing deep western boundary current has been postulated as a mechanism forredistribution and export of organic carbon. As part of a project to understand dynamics ofparticulate organic carbon (POC) in the NW Atlantic margin; we studied the isotopiccharacteristics and molecular level composition of suspended POC collected with in-situfiltration devices deployed throughout the water column at three stations (2000m; 3000m;and 3500m isobaths) on the New England Slope.

Marine DOC radiocarbon methods and DOC/POC exchange,SR Beaupré; J Hwang; ER Druffel,Abstract Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC); defined as the carbon contained in that fractionof organic matter which passes through a 0.2-1.0 micrometer filter; is the largest oceanicreservoir of organic carbon with approximately 600 Gt C. Sources and sinks of this carbonpool are not yet well constrained; with some suggestions that a portion exchanges with theParticulate Organic Carbon pool (POC); ie that fraction retained by filters. Progress inexamining this proposed phenomenon necessitates accurate and precise methods forquantifying DOC concentrations and isotope ratios.

Composition and Sources of Suspended Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) in the Ocean Implied by Radiocarbon and Stable Carbon Isotope Ratios of its Organic Fr...,J Hwang; ER Druffel; S Griffin,Abstract Suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) is a dynamic carbon pool in theocean and is expected to exchange carbon with other organic carbon pools such as sinkingPOC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). To study carbon cycling through suspendedPOC; radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope ratios of three organic fractions (extractablelipids; acid-soluble; and acid-insoluble fractions) were measured on samples collected fromvarious depths at an abyssal station (Station M; 220km off the central California coast).Stable carbon isotope ratios of the acid-insoluble fraction were distinctly lower than those ofthe acid-soluble fraction; but similar to those of the extractable lipids. This trend waspersistent throughout the water column. A similar trend was observed for sinking POC from3450m depth at the same station (Hwang and Druffel; 2003).
