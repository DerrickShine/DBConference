The effects of cultural values in word-of-mouth communication,Desmond Lam; Alvin Lee; Richard Mizerski,Abstract When new products and brands are introduced into other cultures; the speed andextent of the product's acceptance are important concerns for marketers. The spread ofpositive word of mouth (WOM) and the lack of negative WOM about the product or brand byearly adopter groups are critical to the product's successful diffusion in a population. This isthe first study to investigate the effects of consumers' cultural values on their WOM behavior.Data analysis from two samples indicates that the pattern; type; and target receivers ofconsumers' WOM activity depend on their cultural values. The authors use Hofstede's fourcultural dimensions to test the effects of cultural values on WOM behavior to social in-andout-groups. They find that all four dimensions have significant effects on WOM engagementto those groups. Although the authors could not determine the causal nature of the …,Journal of international marketing,2009,147
Proteasome inhibition by lactacystin in primary neuronal cells induces both potentially neuroprotective and pro‐apoptotic transcriptional responses: a microarray an...,Elaine Hau Jin Yew; Nam Sang Cheung; Meng Shyan Choy; Robert Z Qi; Alan Yiu‐Wah Lee; Zhao Feng Peng; Alirio J Melendez; Jayapal Manikandan; Evelyn Siew‐Chuan Koay; Lily‐Lily Chiu; Wooi Loon Ng; Matthew Whiteman; Jeyaseelan Kandiah; Barry Halliwell,Abstract Although inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system has been postulated to playa key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases; studies have also shown thatproteasome inhibition can induce increased expression of neuroprotective heat-shockproteins (HSPs). The global gene expression of primary neurons in response to treatmentwith the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was studied to identify the widest range of possiblepathways affected. Our results showed changes in mRNA abundance; both at different timepoints after lactacystin treatment and at different lactacystin concentrations. Genes that weredifferentially up-regulated at the early time point but not when most cells were undergoingapoptosis might be involved in an attempt to reverse proteasome inhibitor-mediatedapoptosis and include HSP70; HSP22 and cell cycle inhibitors.

Benzo [1; 2-b: 4; 5-b′] dithiophene (BDT)-based small molecules for solution processed organic solar cells,Miaomiao Li; Wang Ni; Xiangjian Wan; Qian Zhang; Bin Kan; Yongsheng Chen,Solution processed small molecule based solar cells have become a competitive alternativeto their polymer counterparts due to the advantages of their defined structure and thus lessbatch to batch variation. With a large and rigid planar conjugated structure; the benzo [1; 2-b:4; 5-b′] dithiophene (BDT) unit has become one of the most widely used and studiedbuilding blocks for high performance small molecule based photovoltaic devices. In thisreview article; we review the progress made in the field of small molecules containing BDTunits for solution-processed organic photovoltaic cells. Insights into several importantaspects regarding the design and synthesis of BDT based small molecules are alsoincluded.,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,2015,85
Semaphorin 5A and plexin-B3 inhibit human glioma cell motility through RhoGDIα-mediated inactivation of Rac1 GTPase,Xinhua Li; Alan Yiu Wah Lee,Abstract Semaphorins and plexins are implicated in the progression of various types ofcancer; although the molecular basis has not been fully elucidated. Here; we report theexpression of plexin-B3 in glioma cells; which upon stimulation by its ligand Sema5A resultsin significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion. A search for the underlyingmechanism revealed direct interaction of plexin-B3 with RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor α(RhoGDIα); a negative regulator of RhoGTPases that blocks guanine nucleotide exchangeand sequesters them away from the plasma membrane. Glioma cells challenged withSema5A indeed showed a marked reduction in Rac1-GTP levels by 60%; with aconcomitant disruption of lamellipodia. The inactivation of Rac1 was corroborated tocontribute to the impediment of glioma cell invasion by Sema5A; as supported by the …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2010,52
Scalable and interactive visual analysis of financial wire transactions for fraud detection,Remco Chang; Alvin Lee; Mohammad Ghoniem; Robert Kosara; William Ribarsky; Jing Yang; Evan Suma; Caroline Ziemkiewicz; Daniel Kern; Agus Sudjianto,Large financial institutions such as Bank of America handle hundreds of thousands of wiretransactions per day. Although most transactions are legitimate; these institutions have legaland financial obligations to discover those that are suspicious. With the methods offraudulent activities ever changing; searching on predefined patterns is often insufficient indetecting previously undiscovered methods. In this paper; we present a set of coordinatedvisualizations based on identifying specific keywords within the wire transactions.

Permission email messages significantly increase gambler retention,William Jolley; Alvin Lee; Richard Mizerski; Saalem Sadeque,Abstract Online gambling providers require customers to allow email messages from theprovider. This requirement provides gambling marketers an inexpensive and potent mediumto encourage frequent gambling; higher bets; and other potentially harmful behaviors thatmay lead to problem gambling. An online casino was developed in 2000 to collect data ononline gamblers' actual gambling behavior after receiving persuasive permission emailmessages. Data were collected over a 36 day period. One of five permission emailmessages in an online gambling experiment had a significant and large effect in increasingexpected gambler retention by an average 20 days.

The influence of cultural values on brand loyalty,Desmond Lam; Alvin YC Lee,It is well documented that culture can influence consumer attitudes and behavior. Whilethere have been numerous studies on how culture influences the four Ps of the marketingmix; few researchers have examined its effect on customer loyalty. More specifically; howconsumers who identify more with certain cultural traits are likely to be more brand loyal.Using Hofstede's cultural dimensions; this study empirically examines cultural effects onconsumer-reported “proneness” to brand loyalty and finds that those who scored highly inindividualism and uncertainty avoidance have greater affinity for exhibiting loyalty to abrand.,ANZMAC 2005: Proceedings of the Australia and New Zealand Marketing Association Conference 2005: Broadening the Boundaries,2005,17
The role of semaphorins and their receptors in gliomas,Janice Wai Sze Law; Alan Yiu Wah Lee,Gliomas are the most common tumor in the central nervous system. High-gradeglioblastomas are characterized by their high invasiveness and resistance to radiotherapy;leading to high recurrence rate and short median survival despite radical surgical resection.Characterizations of gliomas at molecular level have revealed aberrations of various growthfactor receptors; receptor tyrosine kinases; and tumor suppressor genes that lead toderegulation of multiple signaling pathways; thereby contributing to abnormal proliferation;invasion; and resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. Recently; accumulating evidencepoints to the emerging role of axon guidance molecules in glioma progression. Notably;many signaling events harnessed by guidance molecules to regulate cell migration andaxon navigation during development are also found to be involved in the modulation of …,Journal of signal transduction,2012,15
Why do people buy hybrid cars?,Wan Ying Chua; Alvin Lee; Saalem Sadeque,This article reports on the underlying dimensions used by petrol-electric hybrid andconventional car buyers when evaluating a vehicle with the intent to purchase. Buyers ofconventionally fuelled vehicles reported that they considered quality and performance as themost important determinants of choice. They rated as least important; the image they derivefrom driving a particular car and social influence. On the other hand; petrol-electric hybridcar buyers reported that social influence and projecting a “green” image were mostimportant considerations and quality and appeal were least important. These findingsprovide social marketers with a crucial understanding that helps in the selection of anappropriate model to promote the diffusion of eco-friendly vehicles.,Proceedings of Social Marketing Forum; University of Western Australia; Perth; Western Australia,2010,15
pH dependent high transfection efficiency of mouse neuroblastomas using TransFectin,Kevin Wai Yin Chong; Alan Yiu-Wah Lee; Evelyn SC Koay; Sze Jee Seet; Nam Sang Cheung,Abstract Mouse neuroblastoma cell lines are often used in lieu of mouse primary neurons inex vivo experiments; as they provide an easier platform for transfection; compared to thelatter. A well-known inherent problem with this strategy is the relatively low transfectionefficiency (15–30%) of mouse neuroblastoma cell lines such as neuro-2A and N1E-115. Wewere able to improve the transfection efficiency of these cell lines by using the cationic lipidreagent; TransFectin™(Bio-Rad; Hercules; CA; USA) to optimise the transfection conditions.Our results; based on fluorescence intensity determinations and Western blotting forenhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) over-expression in neuro-2A; demonstratedthat pH is a crucial factor in determining the transfection efficiency.

The strategy of global branding and brand equity,Alvin Lee; Jinchao Yao; Richard Mizerski; Claire Lambert,Why does a customer choose one brand over another? What are the factors which wouldmake an individual more inclined to choose your brand? This book offers a way to predictwhich brand a buyer will purchase. It looks at brand performance within a product categoryand tests it in different countries with very different cultures. Following the Predictive BrandChoice (PBC) model; this book seeks to predict a consumer's loyalty and choice. Resultshave shown that PBC can achieve a high level of predictive accuracy; in excess of 70% inmature markets. This accuracy holds even in the face of price competition from a lesspreferred brand. PBC uses a prospective predicting method which does not have to rely on abrand's past performance or a customer's purchase history for prediction.

Gamblers' habit,Richard Mizerski; Katherine Mizerski; Desmond Lam; Alvin Lee,The theories used to understand and predict regular non-problem gambling are almostexclusively affective or cognitive-oriented. These include motives; self-esteem; imageenhancement and illusions of control over random events. However; gambling is one of themost frequently purchased consumer products; and the frequency of past behavior hastraditionally been viewed as “habit” by psychologists and marketers. While habit as thefrequency of past behavior has been shown to be a strong predictor of future behavior ingambling; habit offers little additional insight into gambling behavior in that form. Thefrequency of past purchasing behavior is an important input to NBD-Dirichlet models thatprovide an enhanced ability to understand and predict future purchases of frequentlypurchased consumer package goods.

Measuring consumer rituals: a marketing application.,Larry Neale; Richard Mizerski; Alvin Lee,Abstract Rituals are an important part of society; and are a frequent topic of investigationamong sociologists and anthropologists. Although researchers have previously investigatedritual; this paper is the first to generate a scale to measure consumption ritual. This studyuses a sample of 651 attendees at an Australian Football League game to explore ritualbehavior; define the gameday rituals observed; and design a scale to measure consumptionritual. As a newly generated construct; Australian football sports fan ritual has twodimensions–personal and social rituals. For academic researchers; the findings helpestablish the role of ritual in consumption and the possibility of marketers to generateritualistic activities to enhance sales. Future research opportunities in other productcategories are also discussed.,Proceedings of the American Marketing Association Winter Educators’ Conference: Marketing the Organization and its Products and Services,2008,6
Cultural influence on Word-of-Mouth communication,Desmond Lam; Dick Mizerski; Alvin Lee,SUMMARY The power of word-of-mouth has considerable documentation since the 1960s.Word-of-mouth has been widely reported to be many times more influential than informationfrom prints; radio; and personal selling. Despite the importance and influence of word-of-mouth; it has remained one of the most neglected marketing areas. In fact; many companiesare still struggling to develop effective marketing programs that encourage consumer word-of-mouth communication. The authors of this current study believe that a soundunderstanding of factors influencing word-of-mouth such as those relating to culture mayhelp to create more proactive and targeted promotional programs toward stimulatingconsumer wordof-mouth. Consumers may engage in word-of-mouth for a number of intrinsicreasons. Word-of-mouth among consumers is also affected by other external factors. The …,Marketing Theory and Applications,2005,6

The protective effects of the ethyl acetate fraction and flavonoids from Taraxacum coreanum against oxidative stress in neuronal cells induced by hydrogen peroxide...,Ah Young Lee; Ji Myung Choi; SL Lee; Hyun Young Kim; SH Lee; Eun Ju Cho,Abstract The protective role against oxidative stress under cellular system using C6 gliomacells was studied using the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction; luteolin (1); and luteolin-7-glucoside (2) of Taraxacum coreanum. C6 glioma cells showed low cell viability and highgeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the treatment with generator of hydrogenperoxide (H2O2) and amyloid beta (Aβ25-35). However; the treatment of the EtOAc fractionattenuated the cellular oxidative stress; resulting in significant elevation of cell viability. Inaddition; the production of ROS formation was also decreased by the treatment of the EtOAcfraction. Compounds 1 and 2 were isolated from the EtOAc fraction; and the protective effectwas evaluated. Compounds 1 and 2 led to the increase of cell viability and decrease ofproduction of ROS against oxidative stress by H2O2 and Aβ25-35. The present study …,Korean Journal of Pharmacognosy,2013,2
The relationship of perceived cognitive and decisional controls in information disclosure: decomposition of perceived control,A Lee; CU Lambert; R Law,Customer information is critical for hospitality and tourism companies to provide tailoredservice; but customers may be reluctant to disclose their personal information to thecompanies. Existing research finds that perceived control is positively related to willingnessto disclose; but scant research studies scrutinize its sub-concepts and their relationship withinformation disclosure. This study decomposed perceived control with perceived cognitiveand decisional control and examined their effect on willingness to disclose personalinformation. The results indicated that when a privacy mechanism was available; perceivedcognitive control was more influential to customers' willingness to disclose than perceiveddecisional control was.

Extreme response bias in measuring susceptibility to smoking.,Alvin YC Lee; Richard W Mizerski,Pierce; Choi; Gilpin; Farkas; and Berry (1998) were the first to claim that they could providecausal evidence that tobacco industry advertising and promotion caused adolescentsmoking. This claim continues to significantly influence the theory and conceptualization ofhow youth react to tobacco marketing. The Pierce et al.(1998) methodology has been usedby many researchers to establish the influence of tobacco marketing on adolescent smoking(Goldberg; 2003; NCI; 2006; Sargent; Dalton; & Beach; 2000). Pierce et al.(1998) selectedrespondents for only the second of their two survey longitudinal study because they chosethe extreme-negative response.

How well does the index of receptivity to tobacco pndustry promotion discriminate between smoking and never smoking adolescents?,Chee Shiong Lam; Alvin Lee,Abstract Tobacco advertising is often named as the culprit that causes children to startsmoking (Lancaster & Lancaster; 2003). This belief can partly be attributed to the Index ofReceptivity to Tobacco Industry Promotion (IRTIP) developed by Evans; Farkas; Gilpin;Berry; & Pierce (1995). IRTIP was later modified and used by Pierce; Choi; Gilpin; Farkas; &Berry (1998) in a longitudinal study that claimed to have found a causal link betweenadvertising and adolescent cigarette trial. The model is advertised by the American NationalCancer Institute (2004) as being able to measure the likelihood of an adolescent startingsmoking. Because of Pierce's causality claim and this endorsement; IRTIP has been widelyadopted by tobacco-control researchers. Consequently; the results from IRTIP basedsurveys have played a central role in influencing tobacco control policy. Based on the …,*,2005,2

Corporate Social Responsibility in McDonald’s Australia,Alvin Lee; Claire Lambert,This case focuses on marketing public policy and legislation issues in the businessenvironment. The Commonwealth Government of Australia wants to impose mandatorywarning labels for fast-food served by quick-service chainrestaurants like McDonald's.These warnings are to appear on fast-food packaging to warn diners of the possible harmsarising from consuming fast-food. This is similar to the warnings that are used in Australia ontobacco product packages. This highlights a turning point where legislators appear to beheeding calls of vocal pressure groups to curb and legislate the industry's activities. Theloudest calls have appeared in well-publicized legal cases and film documentaries likeSuper-Size Me. McDonald's has been well-aware of these challenges. The companycontinues to respond and fight legal challenges on these points. As a result; the company …,Asian Case Research Journal,2017,*

Guest discusses an experiment on a sample of 8–18-year-oldswho reported their recognition of brand names in several product categories; and arguesthat brand name recognition is an indicator of their future brand preferences and choices.Guest (1942; p. 803) proposes that the children will have “brand knowledge” for the brandsthey recognize by name alone. He further argues that the children's recognition of a brandmay strongly influence their later preferences.

Abstract A53: Genetic analysis of semaphorin 5A and plexin-B3 in human glioma,Fathima Rifkhana Shah Jahan; Alan Yiu Wah Lee,Semaphorins are a family of axon guidance molecules; which signal through their co-receptors neuropilins and plexins to subserve various functions in the nervous system; theimmune system and during organogenesis. Contrary to their role in development;accumulating evidence suggests the pro-and anti-tumorigenic functions of semaphorins andplexins in different cancer types. Similar to other semaphorins; semaphorin 5A (Sema5A)has recently been implicated in various cancers; though its functions remain ambiguous. Ourformer study revealed the suppressive effect of Sema5A in glioma cell migration andinvasion. Analysis of human glioma specimens revealed a marked down-regulation ofSema5A protein expression in high grade glioblastomas; which are highly infiltrative. Here;we provide evidence that forced expression of Sema5A inhbits glioma cell proliferation by …,*,2013,*

A behavioural study of consumer boycott,Alvin Lee; Zhongmin Wang; Michael Polonsky; R Mizerski,This paper studied sales of BP branded gasoline in the United States of America prior;during and after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill accident. The research was fundedby the Centre for Sustainable and Responsible Organisations at Deakin University. In whatis perhaps the first behavioral study of consumer boycott using market level data; we foundthat consumers' with geographic proximity to the accident were more likely to boycott the BPbrand. In States that bordered or were close to the Gulf of Mexico; BP sales experienced asmall but significant decline as compared to sales in States farther away. The small effect issurprising. We suspect this may be related to the inelastic nature of the product category andthe high degree of product homogeneity within the category.

Sample attrition bias in predicting adolescent susceptibility to smoking due to marketing.,Alvin Yiam Chuah Lee; George Jan Yao Li; Warren Adams; Dick Mizerski,ABSTRACT The results of this article suggest that the Pierce et al.(1998) causal claim thatadolescent smoking trial is solely caused by tobacco industry promotion may suffer fromsample attrition bias. Analysis of the attrition sample from the Pierce et al. data suggestfound one sole significant influencing factor because respondents who were prone toinfluence by role-model smokers and who were more open to smoking had selectedthemselves out of the longitudinal study.,GMC 2008: Journal of Korean Academy of Marketing Science Conference,2008,*

Questioning the construct of'susceptibility'in the causal link between tobacco industry promotion and adolescent smoking,Alvin Lee; Dick Mizerski; Katherine Mizerski,The first article to report on a causal connection between tobacco industry promotion andadolescent smoking (Pierce et al. 1998) had; and continues to have; a significant influenceon the marketing of cigarettes in many parts of the world. A key construct in determiningcausality was the ability to identify the respondents'“susceptibility to smoke”. Through ananalysis of the questions; and reanalysis of the original data used by Pierce et al.(1998); it isshown that the construct is flawed; and needs revision before a causal link can be claimedwith the original data.,ANZMAC 2004: marketing accountabilities and responsibilities; conference proceedings,2004,*

The Impact of Leisure-sport Facility Design on Customer Satisfaction,Alvin Y Lee,Abstract Marketing; retailing; organizational behavior and consumer behavior textbooksoften mention the effects of servicescape atmospherics; physical design and decor elementson facility users. Service managers also recognize it as being an important aspect of theirbusinesses. Yet; in marketing; there is surprisingly little research that is based on theoreticalmodels which predict customer reactions to the different elements in the servicescape. Evenless has been done to explore the effects of servicescape elements on customer satisfactionand behavioral intentions. This thesis focuses on selected aspects of Bitner's (1992)servicescape framework and explores the effects of layout. accessibility; aesthetics;electronic equipment; seating comfort; and cleanliness on customer perceptions of servicequality. Perceived service quality is hypothesized to lead to customer satisfaction; and …,*,2003,*

Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Triggers Macrophage Autophagy To Escape Intracellular Killing By Activation Of The NLRP3 Inflammasome,M Abigail; M Bullimore; C Godinho; G Hubbard; A Lee; E Moore; M Singh; SY Wong,Abstract Inflammasome assembly is critical during inflammation initiation; but its role inbacterial killing remains unclear. In this study; macrophages were infected with P.aeruginosa; causing NLRP3 inflammasome assembly; resulting in macrophage autophagyand reduced bacterial killing. Autophagosome formation is thus triggered to escapeintracellular killing.,*,*,*
The Significance of the Interaction between Plexin-B3 and Cdc42-GTP,Inthrani Raja Indran; Alan Yiu-wah Lee,ABSTRACT Axon extension in the nervous system during embryonic development isbelieved to be guided by numerous axon guidance molecules; which signal through theirreceptors on the surface of neuronal growth cone. One of the putative signaling mechanismsis the small Guanosine Triphosphatases (GTPases); and their downstream effector proteinsthat modulate actin cytoskeleton. Our laboratory has previously shown that the guidancemolecule Plexin B3 interacts with the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound form of celldivision cycle (Cdc42) plexin. This project aims to study how the presence of Plexin B3 couldaffect the availability of Cdc-42 GTP for its physiological effector WASP; thereby sheddinglight on the plausible axon guidance mechanism mediated by Plexin B3.,*,*,*
