Towards identity anonymization on graphs,Kun Liu; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The proliferation of network data in various application domains has raised privacyconcerns for the individuals involved. Recent studies show that simply removing theidentities of the nodes before publishing the graph/social network data does not guaranteeprivacy. The structure of the graph itself; and in its basic form the degree of the nodes; canbe revealing the identities of individuals. To address this issue; we study a specific graph-anonymization problem. We call a graph k-degree anonymous if for every node v; there existat least k-1 other nodes in the graph with the same degree as v. This definition of anonymityprevents the re-identification of individuals by adversaries with a priori knowledge of thedegree of certain nodes. We formally define the graph-anonymization problem that; given agraph G; asks for the k-degree anonymous graph that stems from G with the minimum …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,699
Finding a team of experts in social networks,Theodoros Lappas; Kun Liu; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Given a task T; a pool of individuals X with different skills; and a social network Gthat captures the compatibility among these individuals; we study the problem of finding X; asubset of X; to perform the task. We call this the T EAM F ORMATION problem. We requirethat members of X'not only meet the skill requirements of the task; but can also workeffectively together as a team. We measure effectiveness using the communication costincurred by the subgraph in G that only involves X'. We study two variants of the problem fortwo different communication-cost functions; and show that both variants are NP-hard. Weexplore their connections with existing combinatorial problems and give novel algorithms fortheir solution. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work to consider the T EAM FORMATION problem in the presence of a social network of individuals.

A framework for computing the privacy scores of users in online social networks,Kun Liu; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract A large body of work has been devoted to address corporate-scale privacyconcerns related to social networks. Most of this work focuses on how to share socialnetworks owned by organizations without revealing the identities or the sensitiverelationships of the users involved. Not much attention has been given to the privacy risk ofusers posed by their daily information-sharing activities. In this article; we approach theprivacy issues raised in online social networks from the individual users' viewpoint: wepropose a framework to compute the privacy score of a user. This score indicates the user'spotential risk caused by his or her participation in the network. Our definition of privacy scoresatisfies the following intuitive properties: the more sensitive information a user discloses;the higher his or her privacy risk. Also; the more visible the disclosed information …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2010,202
Detecting anomalous access patterns in relational databases,Ashish Kamra; Evimaria Terzi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A considerable effort has been recently devoted to the development of DatabaseManagement Systems (DBMS) which guarantee high assurance and security. An importantcomponent of any strong security solution is represented by Intrusion Detection (ID)techniques; able to detect anomalous behavior of applications and users. To date; however;there have been few ID mechanisms proposed which are specifically tailored to functionwithin the DBMS. In this paper; we propose such a mechanism. Our approach is based onmining SQL queries stored in database audit log files. The result of the mining process isused to form profiles that can model normal database access behavior and identify intruders.We consider two different scenarios while addressing the problem. In the first case; weassume that the database has a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model in place …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,181
Finding effectors in social networks,Theodoros Lappas; Evimaria Terzi; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Assume a network (V; E) where a subset of the nodes in V are active. We considerthe problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activationstate; under a given information-propagation model. We call these nodes effectors. Weformally define the k-Effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs.We show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only NP-hard to solve optimally; but alsoNP-hard to approximate. We also show that; for some special cases; the problem can besolved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. To the best ofour knowledge; this is the first work to consider the k-Effectors problem in networks. Weexperimentally evaluate our algorithms using the DBLP co-authorship graph; where wesearch for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,174
Intrusion detection in RBAC-administered databases,Elisa Bertino; Evimaria Terzi; Ashish Kamra; Athena Vakali,A considerable effort has been recently devoted to the development of databasemanagement systems (DBMS) which guarantee high assurance security and privacy. Animportant component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection(ID) systems; able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date;however; there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to databasesystems. In this paper; we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID isbased on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is usedto form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additionalfeature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control(RBAC).

Context-sensitive ranking,Rakesh Agrawal; Ralf Rantzau; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Contextual preferences take the form that item i1 is preferred to item i 2 in thecontext of X. For example; a preference might state the choice for Nicole Kidman overPenelope Cruz in drama movies; whereas another preference might choose Penelope Cruzover Nicole Kidman in the context of Spanish dramas. Various sources provide preferencesindependently and thus preferences may contain cycles and contradictions. We reconciledemocratically the preferences accumulated from various sources and use them to create apriori orderings of tuples in an off-line preprocessing step. Only a few representative ordersare saved; each corre-sponding to a set of contexts. These orders and associated contextsare used at query time to expeditiously provide ranked answers. We formally definecontextual preferences; provide algorithms for creating orders and processing queries …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,132

Selecting a comprehensive set of reviews,Panayiotis Tsaparas; Alexandros Ntoulas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Online user reviews play a central role in the decision-making process of users for avariety of tasks; ranging from entertainment and shopping to medical services. As user-generated reviews proliferate; it becomes critical to have a mechanism for helping the users(information consumers) deal with the information overload; and presenting them with asmall comprehensive set of reviews that satisfies their information need. This is particularlyimportant for mobile phone users; who need to make decisions quickly; and have a devicewith limited screen real-estate for displaying the reviews. Previous approaches haveaddressed the problem by ranking reviews according to their (estimated) helpfulness.However; such approaches do not account for the fact that the top few high-quality reviewsmay be highly redundant; repeating the same information; or presenting the same …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,82
Efficient algorithms for sequence segmentation,Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The sequence segmentation problem asks for a partition of the sequence into k non-overlapping segments that cover all data points such that each segment is as homogeneousas possible. This problem can be solved optimally using dynamic programming in O (n 2 k)time; where n is the length of the sequence. Given that sequences in practice are too long; aquadratic algorithm is not an adequately fast solution. Here; we present an alternativeconstantfactor approximation algorithm with running time O (n 4/3 k 5/3). We call thisalgorithm the DNS algorithm. We also consider the recursive application of the DNSalgorithm; that results in a faster algorithm (O (n log log n) running time) with O (log n)approximation factor; and study the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff. Extensive experimentalresults show that these algorithms outperform other widely-used heuristics. The same …,*,2006,73
Clustering large probabilistic graphs,George Kollios; Michalis Potamias; Evimaria Terzi,We study the problem of clustering probabilistic graphs. Similar to the problem of clusteringstandard graphs; probabilistic graph clustering has numerous applications; such as findingcomplexes in probabilistic protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and discovering groupsof users in affiliation networks. We extend the edit-distance-based definition of graphclustering to probabilistic graphs. We establish a connection between our objective functionand correlation clustering to propose practical approximation algorithms for our problem. Abenefit of our approach is that our objective function is parameter-free. Therefore; thenumber of clusters is part of the output. We also develop methods for testing the statisticalsignificance of the output clustering and study the case of noisy clusterings. Using a realprotein-protein interaction network and ground-truth data; we show that our methods …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,67
Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities,Patricia I Diaz; AK Dupuy; L Abusleme; B Reese; C Obergfell; L Choquette; Anna Dongari‐Bagtzoglou; Douglas E Peterson; E Terzi; LD Strausbaugh,Summary High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However; beforeundertaking large-scale studies; it is necessary to understand the technique-associatedlimitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias inspecies representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. Wethen characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthysubjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversityand biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolationbiases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singletonoperational taxonomic units (OTUs).

Constructing comprehensive summaries of large event sequences,Jerry Kiernan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Event sequences capture system and user activity over time. Prior research onsequence mining has mostly focused on discovering local patterns appearing in asequence. While interesting; these patterns do not give a comprehensive summary of theentire event sequence. Moreover; the number of patterns discovered can be large. In thisarticle; we take an alternative approach and build short summaries that describe an entiresequence; and discover local dependencies between event types. We formally define thesummarization problem as an optimization problem that balances shortness of the summarywith accuracy of the data description. We show that this problem can be solved optimally inpolynomial time by using a combination of two dynamic-programming algorithms. We alsoexplore more efficient greedy alternatives and demonstrate that they work well on large …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2009,54
Selecting a characteristic set of reviews,Theodoros Lappas; Mark Crovella; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Online reviews provide consumers with valuable information that guides theirdecisions on a variety of fronts: from entertainment and shopping to medical services.Although the proliferation of online reviews gives insights about different aspects of aproduct; it can also prove a serious drawback: consumers cannot and will not readthousands of reviews before making a purchase decision. This need to extract usefulinformation from large review corpora has spawned considerable prior work; but so far allhave drawbacks. Review summarization (generating statistical descriptions of review sets)sacrifices the immediacy and narrative structure of reviews. Likewise; review selection(identifying a subset of'helpful'or'important'reviews) leads to redundant or non-representativesummaries. In this paper; we fill the gap between existing review-summarization and …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,53
On honesty in sovereign information sharing,Rakesh Agrawal; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract We study the following problem in a sovereign information-sharing setting: How toensure that the individual participants; driven solely by self-interest; will behave honestly;even though they can benefit from cheating. This benefit comes from learning more thannecessary private information of others or from preventing others from learning thenecessary information. We take a game-theoretic approach and design a game (strategiesand payoffs) that models this kind of interactions. We show that if nobody is punished forcheating; rational participants will not behave honestly. Observing this; our game includesan auditing device that periodically checks the actions of the participants and penalizesinappropriate behavior. In this game we give conditions under which there exists a uniqueequilibrium (stable rational behavior) in which every participant provides truthful …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,53
Opinion maximization in social networks,Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The process of opinion formation through synthesis and contrast of differentviewpoints has been the subject of many studies in economics and social sciences. Today;this process manifests itself also in online social networks and social media. The keycharacteristic of successful promotion campaigns is that they take into consideration suchopinion-formation dynamics in order to create a overall favorable opinion about a specificinformation item; such as a person; a product; or an idea. In this paper; we adopt a well-established model for social-opinion dynamics and formalize the campaigndesign problemas the problem of identifying a set of target individuals whose positive opinion about aninformation item will maximize the overall positive opinion for the item in the social network.We call this problem CAMPAIGN. We study the complexity of the CAMPAIGN problem …,*,2013,51
GraSS: Graph structure summarization,Kristen LeFevre; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Large graph databases are commonly collected and analyzed in numerousdomains. For reasons related to either space efficiency or for privacy protection (eg; in thecase of social network graphs); it sometimes makes sense to replace the original graph witha summary; which removes certain details about the original graph topology. However; thissummarization process leaves the database owner with the challenge of processing queriesthat are expressed in terms of the original graph; but are answered using the summary. Inthis paper; we propose a formal semantics for answering queries on summaries of graphstructures. At its core; our formulation is based on a random worlds model. We show thatimportant graph-structure queries (eg; adjacency; degree; and eigenvector centrality) can beanswered efficiently and in closed form using these semantics. Further; based on this …,*,2010,50
A survey of algorithms and systems for expert location in social networks,Theodoros Lappas; Kun Liu; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Given a particular task and a set of candidates; one often wants to identify the rightexpert (or set of experts) that can perform the given task. We call this problem the expert-location problem and we survey its different aspects as they arise in practice. For example;given the activities of candidates within a context (eg; authoring a document; answering aquestion); we first describe methods for evaluating the level of expertise for each of them.Often; experts are organized in networks that correspond to social networks ororganizational structures of companies. We next devote part of the chapter for describingalgorithms that compute the expertise level of individuals by taking into account theirposition in such a network. Finally; complex tasks often require the collective expertise ofmore than one experts. In such cases; it is more realistic to require a team of experts that …,*,2011,46
Segmentation and dimensionality reduction,Ella Bingham; Aristides Gionis; Niina Haiminen; Heli Hiisilä; Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Sequence segmentation and dimensionality reduction have been used as methodsfor studying high-dimensional sequences—they both reduce the complexity of therepresentation of the original data. In this paper we study the interplay of these twotechniques. We formulate the problem of segmenting a sequence while modeling it with abasis of small size; thus essentially reducing the dimension of the input sequence. We givethree different algorithms for this problem: all combine existing methods for sequencesegmentation and dimensionality reduction. For two of the proposed algorithms we proveguarantees for the quality of the solutions obtained. We describe experimental results onsynthetic and real datasets; including data on exchange rates and genomic sequences. Ourexperiments show that the algorithms indeed discover underlying structure in the data …,*,2006,40
Customized tour recommendations in urban areas,Aristides Gionis; Theodoros Lappas; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The ever-increasing urbanization coupled with the unprecedented capacity tocollect and process large amounts of data have helped to create the vision of intelligenturban environments. One key aspect of such environments is that they allow people toeffectively navigate through their city. While GPS technology and route-planning serviceshave undoubtedly helped towards this direction; there is room for improvement in intelligenturban navigation. This vision can be fostered by the proliferation of location-based socialnetworks; such as Foursquare or Path; which record the physical presence of users indifferent venues through check-ins. This information can then be used to enhance intelligenturban navigation; by generating customized path recommendations for users. In this paper;we focus on the problem of recommending customized tours in urban settings. These …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,38
A framework for the evaluation and management of network centrality,Vatche Ishakian; Dóra Erdös; Evimaria Terzi; Azer Bestavros,Abstract Network-analysis literature is rich in node-centrality measures that quantify thecentrality of a node as a function of the (shortest) paths of the network that go through it.Existing work focuses on defining instances of such measures and designing algorithms forthe specific combinatorial problems that arise for each instance. In this work; we propose aunifying definition of centrality that subsumes all path-counting based centrality definitions:eg; stress; betweenness or paths centrality. We also define a generic algorithm forcomputing this generalized centrality measure for every node and every group of nodes inthe network. Next; we define two optimization problems: k-GROup CENTRALITYMAXIMIZATION and k-EDGE CENTRALITY BOOSTING. In the former; the task is to identifythe subset of k nodes that have the largest group centrality. In the latter; the goal is to …,*,2012,35

This work encompasses concerns of users as well as service providersand third parties. Our goal is to approach such concerns from a computer-scienceperspective; and building upon existing work on privacy; security; statistical modeling anddatabases to provide an overview of the technical and algorithmic issues related to privacyin OSNs. We start our survey by introducing a simple OSN data model and describecommon statistical-inference techniques that can be used to infer potentially sensitiveinformation. Next; we describe some privacy definitions and privacy mechanisms for datapublishing.

Grouping students in educational settings,Rakesh Agrawal; Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Given a class of large number of students; each exhibiting a different ability level;how can we group them into sections so that the overall gain for students is maximized? Thisquestion has been a topic of central concern and debate amongst social scientists andpolicy makers for a long time. We propose a framework for rigorously studying this question;taking a computational perspective. We present a formal definition of the grouping problemand investigate some of its variants. Such variants are determined by the desired number ofgroups as well as the definition of the gain for each student in the group. We focus on twonatural instantiations of the gain function and we show that for both of them the problem ofidentifying a single group of students that maximizes the gain among its members can besolved in polynomial time. The corresponding partitioning problem; where the goal is to …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,30
Nestedness and segmented nestedness,Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Consider each row of a 0-1 dataset as the subset of the columns for which the rowhas an 1. Then a dataset is nested; if for all pairs of rows one row is either a superset orsubset of the other. The concept of nestedness has its origins in ecology; where approximateversions of it has been used to model the species distribution in different locations. Weargue that nestedness and its extensions are interesting properties of datasets; and that theycan be applied also to domains other than ecology. We first define natural measures ofnestedness and study their properties. We then define the concept of k-nestedness: adataset is (almost) k-nested if the set of columns can be partitioned to k parts so that eachpart is (almost) nested. We consider the algorithmic problems of computing how far a datasetis from being k-nested; and for finding a good partition of the columns into k parts.

Reconstructing randomized social networks,Niko Vuokko; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract In social networks; nodes correspond to entities and edges to links between them.In most of the cases; nodes are also associated with a set of features. Noise; missing valuesor efforts to preserve privacy in the network may transform the original network G and itsfeature vectors F. This transformation can be modeled as a randomization method. Here; weaddress the problem of reconstructing the original network and set of features given theirrandomized counterparts G′ and F′ and knowledge of the randomization model. Weidentify the cases in which the original network G and feature vectors F can be reconstructedin polynomial time. Finally; we illustrate the efficacy of our methods using both generatedand real datasets.,*,2010,23
Interpretable nonnegative matrix decompositions,Saara Hyvönen; Pauli Miettinen; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract A matrix decomposition expresses a matrix as a product of at least two factormatrices. Equivalently; it expresses each column of the input matrix as a linear combinationof the columns in the first factor matrix. The interpretability of the decompositions is a keyissue in many data-analysis tasks. We propose two new matrix-decomposition problems: thenonnegative CX and nonnegative CUR problems; that give naturally interpretable factors.They extend the recently-proposed column and column-row based decompositions; and areaimed to be used with nonnegative matrices. Our decompositions represent the input matrixas a nonnegative linear combination of a subset of its columns (or columns and rows). Wepresent two algorithms to solve these problems and provide an extensive experimentalevaluation where we assess the quality of our algorithms' results as well as the …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,23
Peer and authority pressure in information-propagation models,Aris Anagnostopoulos; George Brova; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Existing models of information diffusion assume that peer influence is the mainreason for the observed propagation patterns. In this paper; we examine the role of authoritypressure on the observed information cascades. We model this intuition by characterizingsome nodes in the network as “authority” nodes. These are nodes that can influence largenumber of peers; while themselves cannot be influenced by peers. We propose a model thatassociates with every item two parameters that quantify the impact of the peer and theauthority pressure on the item's propagation. Given a network and the observed diffusionpatterns of the item; we learn these parameters from the data and characterize the item aspeer-or authority-propagated. We also develop a randomization test that evaluates thestatistical significance of our findings and makes our item characterization robust to noise …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,22
Comparing segmentations by applying randomization techniques,Niina Haiminen; Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,There exist many segmentation techniques for genomic sequences; and the segmentationscan also be based on many different biological features. We show how to evaluate andcompare the quality of segmentations obtained by different techniques and alternativebiological features. We apply randomization techniques for evaluating the quality of a givensegmentation. Our example applications include isochore detection and the discovery ofcoding-noncoding structure. We obtain segmentations of relevant sequences by applyingdifferent techniques; and use alternative features to segment on. We show that some of theobtained segmentations are very similar to the underlying true segmentations; and thissimilarity is statistically significant. For some other segmentations; we show that equallygood results are likely to appear by chance. We introduce a framework for evaluating …,BMC bioinformatics,2007,22
Aggregating time partitions,Taneli Mielikäinen; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Partitions of sequential data exist either per se or as a result of sequencesegmentation algorithms. It is often the case that the same timeline is partitioned in manydifferent ways. For example; different segmentation algorithms produce different partitions ofthe same underlying data points. In such cases; we are interested in producing anaggregate partition; ie; a segmentation that agrees as much as possible with the inputsegmentations. Each partition is defined as a set of continuous non-overlapping segments ofthe timeline. We show that this problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time usingdynamic programming. We also propose faster greedy heuristics that work well in practice.We experiment with our algorithms and we demonstrate their utility in clustering the behaviorof mobile-phone users and combining the results of different segmentation algorithms on …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,22
Models and algorithms for network immunization,George Giakkoupis; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Recently; there has been significant research activity in the algorithmic analysis ofcomplex networks; such as social networks; or information networks. A problem of greatpractical importance is that of network immunization against virus spread. Given a network; avirus-propagation model; and an immunization cost function; we are interested in containingthe spread of the virus while minimizing the immunization cost. In this paper; we considertwo viruspropagation models and we propose immunization algorithms for each model. Theexperimental evaluation shows that our algorithms perform well on both synthetic and realgraphs. Furthermore; it reveals the following interesting facts (a) the simple heuristic ofimmunizing the nodes with the highest degree is not optimal; and (b) our algorithms performsignificantly better in small-world networks.,Technical Report; Technical Report C-2005-75,2005,22
Microbiome profiles in periodontitis in relation to host and disease characteristics,Bo-Young Hong; Michel V Furtado Araujo; Linda D Strausbaugh; Evimaria Terzi; Effie Ioannidou; Patricia I Diaz,Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the supporting tissues surroundingteeth. The occurrence of periodontitis is associated with shifts in the structure of thecommunities that inhabit the gingival sulcus. Although great inter-subject variability in thesubgingival microbiome has been observed in subjects with periodontitis; it is unclearwhether distinct community types exist and if differences in microbial signatures correlatewith host characteristics or with the variable clinical presentations of periodontitis. Therefore;in this study we explored the existence of different community types in periodontitis and theirrelationship with host demographic; medical and disease-related clinical characteristics.Clustering analyses of microbial abundance profiles suggested two types of communities (Aand B) existed in the 34 subjects with periodontitis evaluated.

Privacy-aware data management in information networks,Michael Hay; Kun Liu; Gerome Miklau; Jian Pei; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The proliferation of information networks; as a means of sharing information; hasraised privacy concerns for enterprises who manage such networks and for individual usersthat participate in such networks. For enterprises; the main challenge is to satisfy twocompeting goals: releasing network data for useful data analysis and also preserving theidentities or sensitive relationships of the individuals participating in the network. Individualusers; on the other hand; require personalized methods that increase their awareness of thevisibility of their private information.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,21
Toward identity anonymization in social networks,Kenneth L Clarkson; Kun Liu; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The proliferation of network data in various application domains has raised privacyconcerns for the individuals involved. Recent studies show that simply removing theidentities of the nodes before publishing the graph/social network data does not guaranteeprivacy. The structure of the graph itself; and in its basic form the degree of the nodes; canbe revealing the identities of individuals. To address this issue; we study a specific graph-anonymization problem. We call a graph k-degree anonymous if for every node v; there existat least k-1 other nodes in the graph with the same degree as v. This definition of anonymityprevents the re-identification of individuals by adversaries with a priori knowledge of thedegree of certain nodes. We formally define the graph-anonymization problem that; given agraph G; asks for the k-degree anonymous graph that stems from G with the minimum …,*,2010,20
Highlighting diverse concepts in documents,Kun Liu; Evimaria Terzi; Tyrone Grandison,Abstract We show the underpinnings of a method for summarizing documents: it ingests adocument and automatically highlights a small set of sentences that are expected to coverthe different aspects of the document. The sentences are picked using simple coverage andorthogonality criteria. We describe a novel combinatorial formulation that captures exactlythe document-summarization problem; and we develop simple and efficient algorithms forsolving it. We compare our algorithms with many popular document-summarizationtechniques via a broad set of experiments on real data. The results demonstrate that ouralgorithms work well in practice and give high-quality summaries.,*,2009,20

Database systems are thus not any longer confined to well-protectedenvironments. In this paper; we focus on a specific type of attack; known as query flood.Under such an attack; a subject; or a colluding set of subjects; floods the database with avery large number of requests thus making the database unable to serve; with adequateresponse time; requests from honest subjects. The approach we propose is based onmodeling access profiles and using these profiles to detect unusual behaviors in thesubjects accessing the database. Our approach supports varying granularities in that onecan build a single profile for the entire database or build specialized profiles for each table inthe database.

Algorithms for identity anonymization on graphs,*,The proliferation of network data in various application domains has raised privacy concernsfor the individuals involved. Recent studies show that simply removing the identities of thenodes before publishing the graph/social network data does not guarantee privacy. Thestructure of the graph itself; and in is basic form the degree of the nodes; can be revealingthe identities of individuals. To address this issue; a specific graph-anonymizationframework is proposed. A graph is called k-degree anonymous if for every node v; thereexist at least k− 1 other nodes in the graph with the same degree as v. This definition ofanonymity prevents the re-identification of individuals by adversaries with a priori knowledgeof the degree of certain nodes. Given a graph G; the proposed graph-anonymizationproblem asks for the k-degree anonymous graph that stems from G with the minimum …,*,2009,17
Knowledge representation; ontologies; and the semantic web,Evimaria Terzi; Athena Vakali; Mohand-Saïd Hacid,Abstract A unified representation for web data and web resources; is absolutely necessary innowdays large scale Internet data management systems. This representation will allow forthe machines to meaningfully process the available information and provide semanticallycorrect answers to imposed queries. Ontologies are expected to play an important roletowards this direction of web technology which defines the so called; Semantic Web. Thegoal of this paper is to provide an overview of the Knowledge Representation (KR)techniques and languages that can be used as standards in the Semantic Web.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2003,17
Profit-maximizing cluster hires,Behzad Golshan; Theodoros Lappas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Team formation has been long recognized as a natural way to acquire a diversepool of useful skills; by combining experts with complementary talents. This allowsorganizations to effectively complete beneficial projects from different domains; while alsohelping individual experts position themselves and succeed in highly competitive jobmarkets. Here; we assume a collection of projects ensuremath {P}; where each projectrequires a certain set of skills; and yields a different benefit upon completion. We are furtherpresented with a pool of experts ensuremath {X}; where each expert has his own skillset andcompensation demands. Then; we study the problem of hiring a cluster of experts T⊆ X; sothat the overall compensation (cost) does not exceed a given budget B; and the total benefitof the projects that this team can collectively cover is maximized.

Eventsummarizer: a tool for summarizing large event sequences,Jerry Kiernan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract We present EventSummarizer-a tool for extracting comprehensive summaries fromlarge event sequences. EventSummarizer takes as input a sequence with events of differenttypes that occur during an observation period; and creates a partitioning of this time periodinto contiguous non-overlapping intervals such that each interval can be described by asimple model. Within each interval local associations between events of different types arereported. EventSummarizer runs on top of any Relational DataBase Management System(RDBMS); on tables with a timestamp attribute. Our system is parameter free and has avisual interface that provides the user with a global view of the input sequence via thesegmentation of the timeline. The easy-to-use interface provides the user with the option tofurther examine the activity and associations of event types within each segment.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,15
Determining significance of pairwise co-occurrences of events in bursty sequences,Niina Haiminen; Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,Event sequences where different types of events often occur close together arise; eg; whenstudying potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBS; events) of certain transcriptionfactors (TF; types) in a DNA sequence. These events tend to occur in bursts: in somegenomic regions there are more genes and therefore potentially more binding sites; while insome; possibly very long regions; hardly any events occur. Also some types of events mayoccur in the sequence more often than others. Tendencies of co-occurrence of binding sitesof two or more TFs are interesting; as they may imply a co-operative role between the TFs inregulatory processes. Determining a numerical value to summarize the tendency for co-occurrence between two TFs can be done in a number of ways. However; testing for thesignificance of such values should be done with respect to a relevant null model that …,BMC bioinformatics,2008,15
Routing state distance: A path-based metric for network analysis,Gonca Gürsun; Natali Ruchansky; Evimaria Terzi; Mark Crovella,Abstract Characterizing the set of routes used between domains is an important and difficultproblem. The size and complexity of the millions of BGP paths in use at any time can hideimportant phenomena and hinder attempts to understand the path selection behavior ofASes. In this paper we introduce a new approach to analysis of the interdomain routingsystem designed to shed light on collective routing policies. Our approach starts by defininga new metric fordistance'between prefixes; which we call routing state distance (RSD). Weshow that RSD has a number of properties that make it attractive for use in visualizing andanalyzing the state of the BGP system. Further; since RSD is a metric; it lends itself naturallyto use in clustering prefixes or ASes. In fact; the properties of RSD allow us to define anatural clustering criterion; and we show that this criterion admits to a simple clustering …,Proceedings of the 2012 Internet Measurement Conference,2012,14
Learning the nature of information in social networks,Rakesh Agrawal Michalis Potamias; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract We postulate that the nature of information items plays a vital role in the observedspread of these items in a social network. We capture this intuition by proposing a model thatassigns to every information item two parameters: endogeneity and exogeneity. Theendogeneity of the item quantifies its tendency to spread primarily through the connectionsbetween nodes; the exogeneity quantifies its tendency to be acquired by the nodes;independently of the underlying network. We also extend this item-based model to take intoaccount the openness of each node to new information. We quantify openness byintroducing the receptivity of a node. Given a social network and data related to the orderingof adoption of information items by nodes; we develop a maximum-likelihood framework forestimating endogeneity; exogeneity and receptivity parameters. We apply our …,*,2012,14
A spectral algorithm for computing social balance,Evimaria Terzi; Marco Winkler,Abstract We consider social networks in which links are associated with a sign; a positive(negative) sign indicates friendship (animosity) between the connected nodes. Recent workstudies such large online signed networks by applying theories that stem from the notion ofsocial balance. Computing the social balance of a signed network requires counting thedistinct configurations of the signed edges within all possible triangles that appear in thenetwork. A naive algorithm for such counting would require time that is cubic to the totalnumber of nodes; such an algorithm is infeasible for large signed networks that aregenerated from online applications. In this paper; we present an efficient spectral algorithmthat computes approximate counts of the signed-triangle configurations. The essence of thealgorithm lies in associating the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a signed network …,International Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph,2011,14
Finding links and initiators: A graph-reconstruction problem,Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Consider a 0–1 observation matrix M; where rows correspond to entities andcolumns correspond to signals; a value of 1 (or 0) in cell (i; j) of M indicates that signal j hasbeen observed (or not observed) in entity i. Given such a matrix we study the problem ofinferring the underlying directed links between entities (rows) and finding which entries inthe matrix are initiators. We formally define this problem and propose an MCMC frameworkfor estimating the links and the initiators given the matrix of observations M. We also showhow this framework can be extended to incorporate a temporal aspect; instead ofconsidering a single observation matrix M we consider a sequence of observation matricesM 1;…; Mt over time.

Urban navigation beyond shortest route: The case of safe paths,Esther Galbrun; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Advancements in mobile technology and computing have fostered the collection ofa large number of civic datasets that capture the pulse of urban life. Furthermore; the opengovernment and data initiative has led many local authorities to make these datasetspublicly available; hoping to drive innovation that will further improve the quality of life for thecity-dwellers. In this paper; we develop a novel application that utilizes crime data to providesafe urban navigation. Specifically; using crime data from Chicago and Philadelphia wedevelop a risk model for their street urban network; which allows us to estimate the relativeprobability of a crime on any road segment. Given such model we define two variants of theSafePaths problem where the goal is to find a short and low-risk path between a source anda destination location. Since both the length and the risk of the path are equally important …,Information Systems,2016,13
The filter-placement problem and its application to minimizing information multiplicity,Dóra Erdös; Vatche Ishakian; Andrei Lapets; Evimaria Terzi; Azer Bestavros,Abstract In many information networks; data items--such as updates in social networks; newsflowing through interconnected RSS feeds and blogs; measurements in sensor networks;route updates in ad-hoc networks--propagate in an uncoordinated manner: nodes oftenrelay information they receive to neighbors; independent of whether or not these neighborsreceived the same information from other sources. This uncoordinated data disseminationmay result in significant; yet unnecessary communication and processing overheads;ultimately reducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negative impacts ofthis information multiplicity phenomenon; we propose that a subset of nodes (selected at keypositions in the network) carry out additional information filtering functionality. Thus; nodesare responsible for the removal (or significant reduction) of the redundant data items …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,13

A divide-and-conquer algorithm for betweenness centrality,Dóra Erdős; Vatche Ishakian; Azer Bestavros; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Given a set of target nodes S in a graph G we define the betweenness centrality of anode v with respect to S as the fraction of shortest paths among nodes in S that contain v.For this setting we describe Brandes++; a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can efficientlycompute the exact values of betweenness scores. Brandes++ uses Brandes− the mostwidely-used algorithm for betweenness computation–as its subroutine. It achieves thenotable faster running times by applying Brandes on significantly smaller networks than theinput graph; and many of its computations can be done in parallel. The degree of speedupachieved by Brandes++ depends on the community structure of the input network as well asthe size of S. Our experiments with real-life networks reveal Brandes++ achieves an averageof 10-fold speedup over Brandes; while there are networks where this speedup is 75-fold …,*,2015,12
Spanning edge centrality: Large-scale computation and applications,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Richard Garcia-Lebron; Ioannis Koutis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The spanning centrality of an edge e in an undirected graph G is the fraction of thespanning trees of G that contain e. Despite its appealing definition and apparent value incertain applications in computational biology; spanning centrality hasn't so far received awider attention as a measure of edge centrality. We may partially attribute this to theperceived complexity of computing it; which appears to be prohibitive for very largenetworks. Contrary to this intuition; spanning centrality can in fact be approximated arbitrarywell by very efficient near-linear time algorithms due to Spielman and Srivastava; combinedwith progress in linear system solvers. In this article we bring theory into practice; withcareful and optimized implementations that allow the fast computation of spanning centralityin very large graphs with millions of nodes.

Inferring visibility: Who's (not) talking to whom?,Gonca Gürsun; Natali Ruchansky; Evimaria Terzi; Mark Crovella,Abstract Consider this simple question: how can a network operator identify the set of routesthat pass through its network? Answering this question is surprisingly hard: BGP onlyinforms an operator about a limited set of routes. By observing traffic; an operator can onlyconclude that a particular route passes through its network--but not that a route does notpass through its network. We approach this problem as one of statistical inference; bringingvarying levels of additional information to bear:(1) the existence of traffic; and (2) the limitedset of publicly available routing tables. We show that the difficulty depends critically on theposition of the network in the overall Internet topology; and that the operators with thegreatest incentive to solve this problem are those for which the problem is hardest.Nonetheless; we show that suitable application of nonparametric inference techniques …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2012,10

Data mining for gene mapping,Hannu Toivonen; Päivi Onkamo; Petteri Hintsanen; Evimaria Terzi; Petteri Sevon; Jozef Zurada; Medo Kantardzic,Abstract Localization of disease susceptibility genes to certain areas in the human genome;or gene mapping; requires careful analysis of genetic marker data. Gene mapping is oftencarried out using a sample of individuals affected by the disease of interest and a sample ofhealthy controls. From a data mining perspective; gene mapping can then be cast as apattern discov-ery and analysis task: which genetically motivated marker patterns help toseparate affected individuals from healthy ones? The marker data constitutes haplotypes: ahaplotype is a string of genetic markers from one chromosome. Individuals who share acommon ancestor; such as those that have inherited the disease gene from this individual;potentially share a substring in their haplotypes. Classi-fication or association analysis ofhaplotypes is thus one approach to gene mapping.

Estimating entity importance via counting set covers,Aristides Gionis; Theodoros Lappas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The data-mining literature is rich in problems asking to assess the importance ofentities in a given dataset. At a high level; existing work identifies important entities either byranking or by selection. Ranking methods assign a score to every entity in the population;and then use the assigned scores to create a ranked list. The major shortcoming of suchapproaches is that they ignore the redundancy between high-ranked entities; which may infact be very similar or even identical. Therefore; in scenarios where diversity is desirable;such methods perform poorly. Selection methods overcome this drawback by evaluating theimportance of a group of entities collectively. To achieve this; they typically adopt a set-coverformulation; which identifies the entities in the minimum set cover as the important ones.However; this dichotomy of entities conceals the fact that; even though an entity may not …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,9
Anonymizing graphs,Tomás Feder; Shubha U Nabar; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract: Motivated by recently discovered privacy attacks on social networks; we study theproblem of anonymizing the underlying graph of interactions in a social network. We call agraph (k; l)-anonymous if for every node in the graph there exist at least k other nodes thatshare at least l of its neighbors. We consider two combinatorial problems arising from thisnotion of anonymity in graphs. More specifically; given an input graph we ask for theminimum number of edges to be added so that the graph becomes (k; l)-anonymous. Wedefine two variants of this minimization problem and study their properties. We show that forcertain values of k and l the problems are polynomial-time solvable; while for others theybecome NP-hard. Approximation algorithms for the latter cases are also given.,arXiv preprint arXiv:0810.5578,2008,9

Problems and algorithms for sequence segmentations,Evimaria Terzi,The analysis of sequential data is required in many diverse areas such astelecommunications; stock market analysis; and bioinformatics. A basic problem related tothe analysis of sequential data is the sequence segmentation problem. A sequencesegmentation is a partition of the sequence into a number of non-overlapping segments thatcover all data points; such that each segment is as homogeneous as possible. This problemcan be solved optimally using a standard dynamic programming algorithm. In the first part ofthe thesis; we present a new approximation algorithm for the sequence segmentationproblem. This algorithm has smaller running time than the optimal dynamic programmingalgorithm; while it has bounded approximation ratio. The basic idea is to divide the inputsequence into subsequences; solve the problem optimally in each subsequence; and …,*,2006,9
Clustered segmentations,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,ABSTRACT The problem of sequence and time-series segmentation has been discussedwidely and it has been applied successfully in a variety of areas; including computationalgenomics; data analysis for scientific applications; and telecommunications. In many ofthese areas the sequences involved are multidimensional; and the goal of the segmentationis to discover sequence segments with small variability. One of the characteristics of existingtechniques is that they force all dimensions to share the same segment boundaries; yet; it isoften reasonable to assume that different dimensions are more correlated than others; andthat concrete and meaningful states are associated only with a subset of dimensions. In thispaper we study the problem of segmenting a multidimensional sequence when thedimensions of the sequence are allowed to form clusters and be segmented separately …,3rd Workshop on Mining Temporal and Sequential Data (TDM),2004,9
Matrix completion with queries,Natali Ruchansky; Mark Crovella; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract In many applications; eg; recommender systems and traffic monitoring; the datacomes in the form of a matrix that is only partially observed and low rank. A fundamentaldata-analysis task for these datasets is matrix completion; where the goal is to accuratelyinfer the entries missing from the matrix. Even when the data satisfies the low-rankassumption; classical matrix-completion methods may output completions with significanterror--in that the reconstructed matrix differs significantly from the true underlying matrix.Often; this is due to the fact that the information contained in the observed entries isinsufficient. In this work; we address this problem by proposing an active version of matrixcompletion; where queries can be made to the true underlying matrix.

Our first contribution lies inproviding two combinatorial formulations of this problem. Both formulations take into accountfactors like the diversification of daily deals and the limited consuming capacity of theuserbase.

Often; the rule collections extracted from existingdata-mining methods can be far too large to be carefully examined and understood by thedata analysts. In this paper; we address exactly this issue of overwhelmingly large rulecollections by introducing and studying the following problem: Given a large collection R ofassociation rules we want to pick a subset of them S⊆ R that best represents the originalcollection R as well as the dataset from which R was extracted. We first quantify the notion ofthe goodness of a ruleset using two very simple and intuitive definitions. Based on thesedefinitions we then formally define and study the corresponding optimization problems ofpicking the best ruleset S⊆ R. We propose algorithms for solving these problems and …,*,2009,7

A framework for evaluating the smoothness of data-mining results,Gaurav Misra; Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The data-mining literature is rich in problems that are formalized as combinatorial-optimization problems. An indicative example is the entity-selection formulation that hasbeen used to model the problem of selecting a subset of representative reviews from areview corpus [11; 22] or important nodes in a social network [10]. Existing combinatorialalgorithms for solving such entity-selection problems identify a set of entities (eg; reviews ornodes) as important.

While a significant amount of research has beendevoted to filtering and organizing review corpora toward the benefit of the buyers; a crucialpart of the reviewing process has been overlooked: reviewer satisfaction. As in every content-based system; the content-generators; in this case the reviewers; serve as the driving force.Therefore; keeping the reviewers satisfied and motivated to continue submitting high-qualitycontent is essential. In this paper; we propose a system that helps potential buyers byfocusing on high-quality and informative reviews; while keeping reviewers content and …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,5
Hierarchical data placement for navigational multimedia applications,Athena Vakali; Evimaria Terzi; Elisa Bertino; Ahmed Elmagarmid,Abstract Navigation has added interactivity in nowadays multimedia applications whichsupport effective accessing to objects of various formats and presentation requirements.Storage issues need to be reconsidered for the new type of navigational multimediaapplications; in order to improve system's performance. This paper addresses the problem ofmultimedia data storage towards improving data accessibility and request servicing undernavigational applications. A navigational graph-based model (for the multimedia datarepresentation) is proposed to guide the data placement under a hierarchical storagetopology. The multimedia data dependencies; access frequencies and timing constraints areused to characterize the graph nodes which correspond to multimedia objects allocated atthe tertiary storage level.

Efficient privacy-preserving link discovery,Xiaoyun He; Jaideep Vaidya; Basit Shafiq; Nabil Adam; Evimaria Terzi; Tyrone Grandison,Abstract Link discovery is a process of identifying association (s) among different entitiesincluded in a complex network structure. These association (s) may represent anyinteraction among entities; for example between people or even bank accounts. The needfor link discovery arises in many applications including law enforcement; counter-terrorism;social network analysis; intrusion detection; and fraud detection. Given the sensitive natureof information that can be revealed from link discovery; privacy is a major concern from theperspective of both individuals and organizations. For example; in the context of financialfraud detection; linking transactions may reveal sensitive information about other individualsnot involved in any fraud. It is known that link discovery can be done in a privacy-preservingmanner by securely finding the transitive closure of a graph. We propose two very efficient …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2009,4
Measuring and moderating opinion polarization in social networks,Antonis Matakos; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The polarization of society over controversial social issues has been the subject ofstudy in social sciences for decades (Isenberg in J Personal Soc Psychol 50 (6): 1141–1151; 1986; Sunstein in J Polit Philos 10 (2): 175–195; 2002). The widespread usage ofonline social networks and social media; and the tendency of people to connect and interactwith like-minded individuals has only intensified the phenomenon of polarization (Bakshy etal. in Science 348 (6239): 1130–1132; 2015). In this paper; we consider the problem ofmeasuring and reducing polarization of opinions in a social network. Using a standardopinion formation model (Friedkin and Johnsen in J Math Soc 15 (3–4): 193–206; 1990); wedefine the polarization index; which; given a network and the opinions of the individuals inthe network; it quantifies the polarization observed in the network.

What do row and column marginals reveal about your dataset?,Behzad Golshan; John Byers; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Numerous datasets ranging from group memberships within social networks topurchase histories on e-commerce sites are represented by binary matrices. While this datais often either proprietary or sensitive; aggregated data; notably row and column marginals;is often viewed as much less sensitive; and may be furnished for analysis. Here; weinvestigate how these data can be exploited to make inferences about the underlying matrixH. Instead of assuming a generative model for H; we view the input marginals as constraintson the dataspace of possible realizations of H and compute the probability density functionof particular entries H (i; j) of interest. We do this; for all the cells of H simultaneously; withoutgenerating realizations but rather via implicitly sampling the datasets that satisfy the inputmarginals. The end result is an efficient algorithm with running time equal to the time …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2013,3
Segmentations with rearrangements,Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Sequence segmentation is a central problem in the analysis of sequential and time-series data. In this paper we introduce and we study a novel variation to the segmentationproblem: in addition to partitioning the sequence we also seek to apply a limited amount ofreordering; so that the overall representation error is minimized. Our problem formulationhas applications in segmenting data collected from a sensor network where some of thesensors might be slightly out of sync; or in the analysis of newsfeed data where news reportson a few different topics are arriving in an interleaved manner. We formulate the problem ofsegmentation with rearrangements and we show that it is an NP-hard problem to solve oreven approximate. We then proceed to devise effective algorithms for the proposed problem;combining ideas from linear programming; dynamic programming; and outlier-detection …,*,2007,3
Data mining for gene mapping,Hannu Toivonen; Päivi Onkamo; Petteri Hintsanen; Evimaria Terzi; Petteri Sevon,Abstract Localization of disease susceptibility genes to certain areas in the human genome;or gene mapping; requires careful analysis of genetic marker data. Gene mapping is oftencarried out using a sample of individuals affected by the disease of interest and a sample ofhealthy controls. From a data mining perspective; gene mapping can then be cast as apattern discovery and analysis task: which genetically motivated marker patterns help toseparate affected individuals from healthy ones? The marker data constitutes haplotypes: ahaplotype is a string of genetic markers from one chromosome. Individuals who share acommon ancestor; such as those that have inherited the disease gene from this individual;potentially share a substring in their haplotypes. Classification or association analysis ofhaplotypes is thus one approach to gene mapping. Further; analyzing the similarities of …,to appear,2004,3

Active network alignment: a matching-based approach,Eric Malmi; Evimaria Terzi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract: Network alignment is the problem of matching the nodes of two graphs; maximizingthe similarity of the matched nodes and the edges between them. This problem isencountered in a wide array of applications-from biological networks to social networks toontologies-where multiple networked data sources need to be integrated. Due to thedifficulty of the task; an accurate alignment can rarely be found without human assistance.Thus; it is of great practical importance to develop network alignment algorithms that canoptimally leverage experts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small numberof nodes. Yet; only a handful of existing works address this active network alignment setting.The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (" are nodes $ a $ and$ b $ the same or not?"); whereas we argue that it is generally easier for a human expert …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.05516,2016,2

An algorithm for building user-role profiles in a trust environment,Evimaria Terzi; Yuhui Zhong; Bharat Bhargava; Sanjay Madria,Abstract A good direction towards building secure systems that operate efficiently in large-scale environments (like the World Wide Web) is the deployment of Role Based AccessControl Methods (RBAC). RBAC architectures do not deal with each user separately; butwith discrete roles that users can acquire in the system. The goal of this paper is to present aclassification algorithm that during its training phase; classifies roles of the users in clusters.The behavior of each user that enters the system holding a specific role is traced via audittrails and any misbehavior is detected and reported (classification phase). This algorithm willbe incorporated in the Role Server architecture; currently under development; enhancing itsability to dynamically adjust the amount of trust of each user and update the correspondingrole assignments.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2002,2

Active Positive-Definite Matrix Completion,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Dóra Erdös; Mark Crovella; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract In many applications; eg; recommender systems and biological data analysis; thedatasets of interest are positive definite (PD) matrices. Such matrices are usually similaritymatrices; obtained by the multiplication of a matrix of preferences or observations with itstranspose. Oftentimes; such real-world matrices are missing many entries and afundamental data-analysis task; known by the term PD-matrix completion; is the inference ofthese missing entries. In this paper; we introduce the active version of PD-matrix completion;in which we assume access to an oracle that; at a given cost; returns the value of anunobserved entry of the PD matrix. In this setting; we consider the following question:“givena fixed budget; which entries should we query so that the completion of the new matrix ismuch more indicative of the underlying data?”. The main contribution of the paper is the …,*,2017,1
Community-aware network sparsification,Aristides Gionis; Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Network sparsification aims to reduce the number of edges of a network whilemaintaining its structural properties; such properties include shortest paths; cuts; spectralmeasures; or network modularity. Sparsification has multiple applications; such as; speedingup graph-mining algorithms; graph visualization; as well as identifying the important networkedges. In this paper we consider a novel formulation of the network-sparsification problem.In addition to the network; we also consider as input a set of communities. The goal is tosparsify the network so as to preserve the network structure with respect to the givencommunities. We introduce two variants of the community-aware sparsification problem;leading to sparsifiers that satisfy different connectedness community properties.

Finding low-tension communities,Esther Galbrun; Behzad Golshan; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Motivated by applications that arise in online social media and collaborationnetworks; there has been a lot of work on community-search. In this class of problems; thegoal is to find a subgraph that satisfies a certain connectivity requirement and contains agiven collection of seed nodes. In this paper; we extend the community-search problem byassociating each individual with a profile. The profile is a numeric score that quantifies theposition of an individual with respect to a topic. We adopt a model where each individualstarts with a latent profile and arrives to a conformed profile through a dynamic conformationprocess; which takes into account the individual's social interaction and the tendency toconform with one's social environment. In this framework; social tension arises from thedifferences between the conformed profiles of neighboring individuals as well as from the …,*,2017,1
Detecting Unusually-Routed ASes: Methods and Applications,Giovanni Comarela; Evimaria Terzi; Mark Crovella,Abstract The routes used in the Internet's interdomain routing system are a rich informationsource that could be exploited to answer a wide range of questions. However; analyzingroutes is difficult; because the fundamental object of study is a set of paths. In this paper wepresent new analysis tools--metrics and methods--for analyzing AS paths; and apply them tostudy interdomain routing in the Internet over a recent 13-year period. Our goal is to developa quantitative understanding of changes in Internet routing at the micro level (of individualASes) as well as at the macro level (of the set of all ASes). To that end we equip an existingmetri (Routing State Distance) with a new set of tools for identifying and characterizingunusually-routed ASes. At the micro level; we use our tools to identify clusters of ASes thathave the most unusual routing at each time (interestingly; such clusters often correspond …,Proceedings of the 2016 Internet Measurement Conference,2016,1

In this paper; we study the complexity ofthe Unveil problem and several of its variants and we obtain the following results. In Unveil;when the variables of the linear system take real values; then the problem is NP-hard tosolve or even approximate. These inapproximability results carry over to the case where thequeries may involve linear combinations of variables. When the variables in the linearequations are binary; then the corresponding binary version of the UNVEIL problem …,*,2014,1
Repetition-aware content placement in navigational networks,Dora Erdos; Vatche Ishakian; Azer Bestavros; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Arguably; the most effective technique to ensure wide adoption of a concept (orproduct) is by repeatedly exposing individuals to messages that reinforce the concept (orpromote the product). Recognizing the role of repeated exposure to a message; in this paperwe propose a novel framework for the effective placement of content: Given the navigationalpatterns of users in a network; eg; web graph; hyperlinked corpus; or road network; andgiven a model of the relationship between content-adoption and frequency of exposition; wedefine the repetition-aware content-placement (RACP) problem as that of identifying the setof B nodes on which content should be placed so that the expected number of usersadopting that content is maximized.

The filter-placement problem and its application to content de-duplication,Azer Bestavros; Dora Erdos; Vatche Ishakian; Andrei Lapets; Evimaria Terzi,In many information networks; data items such as updates in social networks; news flowingthrough interconnected RSS feeds and blogs; measurements in sensor networks; routeupdates in ad-hoc networks; etc. propagate in an uncoordinated manner: nodes often relayinformation they receive to neighbors; independent of whether or not these neighborsreceived such information from other sources. This uncoordinated data dissemination mayresult in significant; yet unnecessary communication and processing overheads; ultimatelyreducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negative impacts of thisinformation multiplicity phenomenon; we propose that a subset of nodes (selected at keypositions in the network) carry out additional information de-duplication functionality namely;the removal (or significant reduction) of the duplicative data items relayed through them …,*,2011,1
Multimedia data elevation under a hierarchical storage model,Athena Vakali; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract. Multimedia data storage is a critical issue in large scale applications. This paperproposes a frequency based multimedia data representation model which effectively guidesdata storage and elevation among the secondary and tertiary storage levels. Multimediadata are stored on the tertiary storage level and (based on certain popularity criteria) theyare elevated on secondary level towards improving both the request servicing and the data'saccessibility. The proposed multimedia data elevation is a prefetching approach since it isperformed “a priori”(not on demand) based on available information on users accesspatterns. Secondary storage placement is performed by the use of two distinct typeplacement policies; namely the “Constructive Placement” and the “Iterative Improvement”algorithms.

Markov Chain Monitoring,Harshal A Chaudhari; Michael Mathioudakis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract: In networking applications; one often wishes to obtain estimates about the numberof objects at different parts of the network (eg; the number of cars at an intersection of a roadnetwork or the number of packets expected to reach a node in a computer network) bymonitoring the traffic in a small number of network nodes or edges. We formalize this task bydefining the'Markov Chain Monitoring'problem. Given an initial distribution of items over thenodes of a Markov chain; we wish to estimate the distribution of items at subsequent times.We do this by asking a limited number of queries that retrieve; for example; how many itemstransitioned to a specific node or over a specific edge at a particular time.

Mining tours and paths in activity networks,Sofia Maria Nikolakaki; Charalampos Mavroforakis; Alina Ene; Evimaria Terzi,ABSTRACT The proliferation of online social networks and the spread of smart mobiledevices enable the collection of information related to a multitude of users' activities. Thesenetworks; where every node is associated with a type of action and a frequency; are usuallyreferred to as activity networks. Examples of such networks include city road networks;where the nodes are intersections and the edges are road segments. Each node isassociated with a number of geolocated actions that users of an online platform took in itsvicinity. In these networks; we define a prize-collecting subgraph to be a connected set ofnodes; which is compact; ie; the nodes are close to each other; and exhibits high levels ofactivity.

Targeted matrix completion,Natali Ruchansky; Mark Crovella; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Matrix completion is a problem that arises in many data-analysis settings where theinput consists of a partially-observed matrix (eg; recommender systems; traffic matrixanalysis etc.). Classical approaches to matrix completion assume that the input partially-observed matrix is low rank. The success of these methods depends on the number ofobserved entries and the rank of the matrix; the larger the rank; the more entries need to beobserved in order to accurately complete the matrix. In this paper; we deal with matrices thatare not necessarily low rank themselves; but rather they contain low-rank submatrices. Wepropose Targeted; which is a general framework for completing such matrices. In thisframework; we first extract the low-rank submatrices and then apply a matrix-completionalgorithm to these low-rank submatrices as well as the remainder matrix separately …,*,2017,*

Correction: Microbiome Profiles in Periodontitis in Relation to Host and Disease Characteristics,Bo-Young Hong; Michel V Furtado Araujo; Linda D Strausbaugh; Evimaria Terzi; Effie Ioannidou; Patricia I Diaz,Discriminant phylotypes are depicted in S6 Fig; which shows; in agreement with thegenuslevel analysis of Zhou et al.[1]; that periodontitis-associated species of Treponemaand Porphyromonas are increased in the small healthy cluster S. However; this small clusterwas also enriched for other periodontitis-associated and core taxa. The large cluster L; onthe contrary; was exclusively enriched for health-associated taxa. The relationship of thesehealth clusters with the periodontitis clusters reported here is shown in the right panel of S3Fig; confirming that; indeed; subjects in the large health cluster are the furthest apart fromsubjects in the periodontitis clusters when PC1 is considered. This analysis suggests thatthese clusters represent a progression of microbiome shifts from health (large cluster HMP)to widespread disease (cluster B perio).,PloS one,2016,*
Computer program product; system and method for providing social services to individuals by employing bi-objective optimization,*,Health-related social service programs (SSs) are an integral part of the American healthcaresystem. These programs seek to assist patients in managing their medical conditions and improvingtheir quality of life. A few examples of these social services include In-Home Support Services(IHSS); Healthcare Insurance Premium Payment Plan; Transportation Programs; and FinancialAssistance Programs (eg Supplemental Security Income (SSI)). While social services are in principlehelpful; they tend not to be leveraged optimally because of a number of challenges associatedwith their design; implementation; promotion and delivery. One of the leading reasons for theunder-utilization of social services is the fact that patients have limited knowledge of theseprograms; their associated time constraints; eligibility requirements; etc. Reference may be hadto FIG. 1 .

The filter-placement problem and its application to content de-duplication,Vatche Ishakian; Azer Bestavros; Dora Erdos; Evimaria Terzi; Andrei Lapets,ABSTRACT In many information networks; data items–such as updates in social networks;news flowing through interconnected RSS feeds and blogs; measurements in sensornetworks; route updates in ad-hoc networks; etc.–propagate in an uncoordinated manner:nodes often relay information they receive to neighbors; independent of whether or not theseneighbors received such information from other sources. This uncoordinated datadissemination may result in significant; yet unnecessary communication and processingoverheads; ultimately reducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negativeimpacts of this information multiplicity phenomenon; we propose that a subset of nodes(selected at key positions in the network) carry out additional information de-duplicationfunctionality–namely; the removal (or significant reduction) of the duplicative data items …,*,2011,*

A framework for reasoning on objects with geometric constraints,Hicham Hajji; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract This paper presents a framework for terminological reasoning by taking intoaccount geometric representation of objects. We consider objects having shapes which aredescribed by means of semi-algebraic sets 1. We show how geometric representations canbe used to define concepts. The formal semantics as well as the reasoning algorithms aregiven. We present a calculus for deciding satisfiability of a constraint knowledge basedescribed in our language. The proposed language can be seen as an extensible core forapplications suchas multimedia databases or spatial and geographic databases.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,*
A Java-Based Model for I/O Scheduling in Tertiary Storage Subsystems,AI Vakali; ED Terzi,Abstract Modern I/O subsystems include large storage servers that are configured to includemultiple on-line and off-line storage media and to deal with a large number of requests withunpredictable access patterns. The problem of minimizing the cost of accessing data storedin all media is critical to the performance of the system. Given the large storage requirementsof modern applications; tertiary storage subsystems have become a crucial component ofmodern large-scale storage servers. This paper's contribution refers to the performanceimprovement of tertiary storage systems by the use of specific scheduling algorithmsimplemented under Java programming environment.

Community-aware network sparsification,Aristides Gionis Polina Rozenshtein Nikolaj Tatti; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Network sparsification aims to reduce the number of edges of a network whilemaintaining its structural properties: shortest paths; cuts; spectral measures; or networkmodularity. Sparsification has multiple applications; such as; speeding up graph-miningalgorithms; graph visualization; as well as identifying the important network edges. In thispaper; we consider a novel formulation of the network-sparsification problem. In addition tothe network; we also consider as input a set of communities. The goal is to sparsify thenetwork so as to preserve the network structure with respect to the given communities. Weintroduce two variants of the community-aware sparsification problem; leading to sparsifiersthat satisfy different connectedness community properties. From the technical point of view;we prove hardness results and devise effective approximation algorithms. Our …,*,*,*

To alleviate the negative impacts of information multiplicity;we propose that a subset of nodes (selected at key positions in the network) carry outadditional information de-duplication functionality. We refer to such nodes as filters. Weformally define the Filter Placement problem as a combinatorial optimization problem; andstudy its computational complexity for different types of graphs. We also present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the problem. Our experimental results indicate that lessthan a handful of filters are enough to alleviate more than 95% of the redundant …,*,*,*

Purdue University; West Lafayette; IN 47907,Evimaria Terzi; Yuhui Zhong; Bharat Bhargava; Sanjay Madria Pankaj,Abstract. A good direction towards building secure systems that operate efficiently in large-scale environments (like the World Wide Web) is the deploy-ment of Role Based AccessControl Methods (RBAC). RBAC architectures do not deal With each user separately; butWith discrete roles that users can acquire in the system. The goal of this paper is to present aclassiﬁcation algorithm that during its training phase; classifies roles of the users in clusters.The behavior of each user that enters the system holding a specific role is traced via audittrails and any misbehavior is detected and reported (classiﬁcation phase). This algorithm willbe incorporated in the Role Server architecture; currently under development; enhancing itsability to dynamically adjust the amount of trust of each user and update the correspondingrole assignments.,*,*,*

Towards Generalized Centrality Measures with Applications to Information Networks,Evimaria Terzi; Azer Bestavros; Dora Erdos; Vatche Ishakian,The problem of identifying “valuable” or “central” nodes in a given network has long beenrecognized as important by researchers and practitioners alike. There exists an abundanceof measures that associate each node with an individual centrality score; the higher thescore of a node the more central its position in the network. Link-analysis algorithms andnode-centrality measures try to capture this intuition [1; 5; 6; 8; 10]. While existing; commonlyused centrality measures give intuition about the relative value of individual nodes; they arenot useful in assessing the collective value of groups of nodes; which is not necessarily nortypically reflected by the sum of the values of the nodes in the group. For example; assumethat the centrality of a group of nodes is defined as the total number of shortest pathspassing through at least one node in the group. In this case; a set of nodes with high …,NSF Workshop on Social Networks and Mobility in the Cloud,*,*
An Object-Based Approach for Effective XML Data Storage,Athena Vakali; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract. XML data storage is a critical issue due to the so-called I/O bottleneck problememerged in nowdays computer systems. This paper presents an object-based XML datarepresentation model towards effective XML data placement The proposed representation ofXML documents is analysed in a two-level scheme: the external level is based on thestructure of a browsing graph whereas the internal level is supported by a tree-like structure.The main contribution of the paper is that it exploits the object data model in order toconsider XML data dependencies; access frequencies and constraints. A simulation modelhas been developed in order to evaluate different XML data placement strategies and theimpact of the proposed representation model in the overall storage process.
