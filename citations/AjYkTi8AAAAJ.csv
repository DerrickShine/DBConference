Finding top-k min-cost connected trees in databases,Bolin Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Shan Wang; Lu Qin; Xiao Zhang; Xuemin Lin,It is widely realized that the integration of database and information retrieval techniques willprovide users with a wide range of high quality services. In this paper; we study processingan l-keyword query; p 1; p 1;...; pl; against a relational database which can be modeled as aweighted graph; G (V; E). Here V is a set of nodes (tuples) and E is a set of edgesrepresenting foreign key references between tuples. Let V i⊆ V be a set of nodes thatcontain the keyword p i. We study finding top-k minimum cost connected trees that contain atleast one node in every subset V i; and denote our problem as GST-k When k= 1; it is knownas a minimum cost group Steiner tree problem which is NP-complete. We observe that thenumber of keywords; l; is small; and propose a novel parameterized solution; with l as aparameter; to find the optimal GST-1; in time complexity O (3 l n+ 2 l ((l+ logn) n+ m)) …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Swarm: Mining relaxed temporal moving object clusters,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Roland Kays,Abstract Recent improvements in positioning technology make massive moving object datawidely available. One important analysis is to find the moving objects that travel together.Existing methods put a strong constraint in defining moving object cluster; that they requirethe moving objects to stick together for consecutive timestamps. Our key observation is thatthe moving objects in a cluster may actually diverge temporarily and congregate at certaintimestamps. Motivated by this; we propose the concept of swarm which captures the movingobjects that move within arbitrary shape of clusters for certain timestamps that are possiblynon-consecutive. The goal of our paper is to find all discriminative swarms; namely closedswarm. While the search space for closed swarms is prohibitively huge; we design amethod; ObjectGrowth; to efficiently retrieve the answer. In ObjectGrowth; two effective …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,237
Finding time-dependent shortest paths over large graphs,Bolin Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract The spatial and temporal databases have been studied widely and intensively overyears. In this paper; we study how to answer queries of finding the best departure time thatminimizes the total travel time from a place to another; over a road network; where the trafficconditions dynamically change from time to time. We study a generalized form of thisproblem; called the time-dependent shortest-path problem. A time-dependent graph GT is agraph that has an edge-delay function; wi; j (t); associated with each edge (vi; vj); to bestored in a database. The edge-delay function wi; j (t) specifies how much time it takes totravel from node vi to node vj; if it departs from vi at time t. A user-specified query is to ask theminimum-travel-time path; from a source node; vs; to a destination node; ve; over the time-dependent graph; GT; with the best departure time to be selected from a time interval T …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,207
Mining periodic behaviors for moving objects,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Roland Kays; Peter Nye,Abstract Periodicity is a frequently happening phenomenon for moving objects. Findingperiodic behaviors is essential to understanding object movements. However; periodicbehaviors could be complicated; involving multiple interleaving periods; partial time span;and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper; we address the problem of miningperiodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect theperiods in complex movement; and how to mine periodic movement behaviors. Our mainassumption is that the observed movement is generated from multiple interleaved periodicbehaviors associated with certain reference locations. Based on this assumption; wepropose a two-stage algorithm; Periodica; to solve the problem. At the first stage; the notionof observation spot is proposed to capture the reference locations.

Fast graph pattern matching,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding; S Yu Philip; Haixun Wang,Due to rapid growth of the Internet technology and new scientific/technological advances;the number of applications that model data as graphs increases; because graphs have highexpressive power to model complicated structures. The dominance of graphs in real-worldapplications asks for new graph data management so that users can access graph dataeffectively and efficiently. In this paper; we study a graph pattern matching problem over alarge data graph. The problem is to find all patterns in a large data graph that match a user-given graph pattern. We propose a new two-step R-join (reachability join) algorithm withfilter step and fetch step based on a cluster-based join-index with graph codes. We considerthe filter step as an R-semijoin; and propose a new optimization approach by interleaving R-joins with R-semijoins. We conducted extensive performance studies; and confirm the …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,149
TwigList: make twig pattern matching fast,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding,Abstract Twig pattern matching problem has been widely studied in recent years. Give anxml tree T. A twig-pattern matching query; Q; represented as a query tree; is to find all theoccurrences of such twig pattern in T. Previous works like HolisticTwig and TJFastdecomposed the twig pattern into single paths from root to leaves; and merged all theoccurrences of such path-patterns to find the occurrences of the twig-pattern matching query;Q. Their techniques can effectively prune impossible path-patterns to avoid producing alarge amount of intermediate results. But they still need to merge path-patterns which occurshigh computational cost. Recently; Twig 2 Stack was proposed to overcome this problemusing hierarchical-stacks to further reduce the merging cost. But; due to the complexhierarchical-stacks Twig 2 Stack used; Twig 2 Stack Stack may end up many random …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,126
Distance-constraint reachability computation in uncertain graphs,Ruoming Jin; Lin Liu; Bolin Ding; Haixun Wang,Abstract Driven by the emerging network applications; querying and mining uncertaingraphs has become increasingly important. In this paper; we investigate a fundamentalproblem concerning uncertain graphs; which we call the distance-constraint reachability(DCR) problem: Given two vertices s and t; what is the probability that the distance from s to tis less than or equal to a user-defined threshold d in the uncertain graph? Since thisproblem is# P-Complete; we focus on efficiently and accurately approximating DCR online.Our main results include two new estimators for the probabilistic reachability. One is aHorvitz-Thomson type estimator based on the unequal probabilistic sampling scheme; andthe other is a novel recursive sampling estimator; which effectively combines a deterministicrecursive computational procedure with a sampling process to boost the estimation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,121
Efficient mining of closed repetitive gapped subsequences from a sequence database,Bolin Ding; David Lo; Jiawei Han; Siau-Cheng Khoo,There is a huge wealth of sequence data available; for example; customer purchasehistories; program execution traces; DNA; and protein sequences. Analyzing this wealth ofdata to mine important knowledge is certainly a worthwhile goal. In this paper; as a stepforward to analyzing patterns in sequences; we introduce the problem of mining closedrepetitive gapped subsequences and propose efficient solutions. Given a database ofsequences where each sequence is an ordered list of events; the pattern we would like tomine is called repetitive gapped subsequence; which is a subsequence (possibly with gapsbetween two successive events within it) of some sequences in the database. We introducethe concept of repetitive support to measure how frequently a pattern repeats in thedatabase. Different from the sequential pattern mining problem; repetitive support …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,109
Text cube: Computing ir measures for multidimensional text database analysis,Cindy Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Feida Zhu; Bo Zhao,Since Jim Gray introduced the concept of” data cube” in 1997; data cube; associated withonline analytical processing (OLAP); has become a driving engine in data warehouseindustry. Because the boom of Internet has given rise to an ever increasing amount of textdata associated with other multidimensional information; it is natural to propose a data cubemodel that integrates the power of traditional OLAP and IR techniques for text. In this paper;we propose a Text-Cube model on multidimensional text database and study effective OLAPover such data. Two kinds of hierarchies are distinguishable inside: dimensional hierarchyand term hierarchy. By incorporating these hierarchies; we conduct systematic studies onefficient text-cube implementation; OLAP execution and query processing. Our performancestudy shows the high promise of our methods.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,105
Differentially private data cubes: optimizing noise sources and consistency,Bolin Ding; Marianne Winslett; Jiawei Han; Zhenhui Li,Abstract Data cubes play an essential role in data analysis and decision support. In a datacube; data from a fact table is aggregated on subsets of the table's dimensions; forming acollection of smaller tables called cuboids. When the fact table includes sensitive data suchas salary or diagnosis; publishing even a subset of its cuboids may compromise individuals'privacy. In this paper; we address this problem using differential privacy (DP); whichprovides provable privacy guarantees for individuals by adding noise to query answers. Wechoose an initial subset of cuboids to compute directly from the fact table; injecting DP noiseas usual; and then compute the remaining cuboids from the initial set. Given a fixed privacyguarantee; we show that it is NP-hard to choose the initial set of cuboids so that the maximalnoise over all published cuboids is minimized; or so that the number of cuboids with noise …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,101
Classifying data streams with skewed class distributions and concept drifts,Jing Gao; Bolin Ding; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Classification is an important data analysis tool that uses a model built from historical data topredict class labels for new observations. More and more applications are featuring datastreams; rather than finite stored data sets; which are a challenge for traditional classificationalgorithms. Concept drifts and skewed distributions; two common properties of data streamapplications; make the task of learning in streams difficult. The authors aim to develop a newapproach to classify skewed data streams that uses an ensemble of models to match thedistribution over under-samples of negatives and repeated samples of positives.,IEEE Internet Computing,2008,101

Analyzing such data has deep implications in many applications; such as; ecologicalstudy; traffic control; mobile communication management; and climatological forecast. In thisarticle; we focus our study on animal movement data analysis and examine advanced datamining methods for discovery of various animal movement patterns. In particular; weintroduce a moving object data mining system; MoveMine; which integrates multiple datamining functions; including sophisticated pattern mining and trajectory analysis.

Discovering threshold-based frequent closed itemsets over probabilistic data,Yongxin Tong; Lei Chen; Bolin Ding,In recent years; many new applications; such as sensor network monitoring and movingobject search; show a growing amount of importance of uncertain data management andmining. In this paper; we study the problem of discovering threshold-based frequent closeditem sets over probabilistic data. Frequent item set mining over probabilistic database hasattracted much attention recently. However; existing solutions may lead an exponentialnumber of results due to the downward closure property over probabilistic data. Moreover; itis hard to directly extend the successful experiences from mining exact data to a probabilisticenvironment due to the inherent uncertainty of data. Thus; in order to obtain a reasonableresult set with small size; we study discovering frequent closed item sets over probabilisticdata. We prove that even a sub-problem of this problem; computing the frequent closed …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,69
Fast set intersection in memory,Bolin Ding; Arnd Christian König,Abstract Set intersection is a fundamental operation in information retrieval and databasesystems. This paper introduces linear space data structures to represent sets such that theirintersection can be computed in a worst-case efficient way. In general; given k(preprocessed) sets; with totally n elements; we will show how to compute their intersectionin expected time [EQUATION]; where r is the intersection size and w is the number of bits ina machine-word. In addition; we introduce a very simple version of this algorithm that hasweaker asymptotic guarantees but performs even better in practice; both algorithmsoutperform the state of the art techniques for both synthetic and real data sets andworkloads.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,61
Stream sequential pattern mining with precise error bounds,Luiz F Mendes; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Sequential pattern mining is an interesting data mining problem with many real-worldapplications. This problem has been studied extensively in static databases. However; inrecent years; emerging applications have introduced a new form of data called data stream.In a data stream; new elements are generated continuously. This poses additionalconstraints on the methods used for mining such data: memory usage is restricted; theinfinitely flowing original dataset cannot be scanned multiple times; and current resultsshould be available on demand. This paper introduces two effective methods for miningsequential patterns from data streams: the SS-BE method and the SS-MB method. Theproposed methods break the stream into batches and only process each batch once. Thetwo methods use different pruning strategies that restrict the memory usage but can still …,Data Mining; 2008.

Blowfish privacy: Tuning privacy-utility trade-offs using policies,Xi He; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Bolin Ding,Abstract Privacy definitions provide ways for trading-off the privacy of individuals in astatistical database for the utility of downstream analysis of the data. In this paper; wepresent Blowfish; a class of privacy definitions inspired by the Pufferfish framework; thatprovides a rich interface for this trade-off. In particular; we allow data publishers to extenddifferential privacy using a policy; which specifies (a) secrets; or information that must bekept secret; and (b) constraints that may be known about the data. While the secretspecification allows increased utility by lessening protection for certain individual properties;the constraint specification provides added protection against an adversary who knowscorrelations in the data (arising from constraints). We formalize policies and present novelalgorithms that can handle general specifications of sensitive information and certain …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,58
Online mobile micro-task allocation in spatial crowdsourcing,Yongxin Tong; Jieying She; Bolin Ding; Libin Wang; Lei Chen,With the rapid development of smartphones; spatial crowdsourcing platforms are gettingpopular. A foundational research of spatial crowdsourcing is to allocate micro-tasks tosuitable crowd workers. Most existing studies focus on offline scenarios; where all thespatiotemporal information of micro-tasks and crowd workers is given. However; they areimpractical since micro-tasks and crowd workers in real applications appear dynamicallyand their spatiotemporal information cannot be known in advance. In this paper; to addressthe shortcomings of existing offline approaches; we first identify a more practical micro-taskallocation problem; called the Global Online Micro-task Allocation in spatial crowdsourcing(GOMA) problem. We first extend the state-of-art algorithm for the online maximum weightedbipartite matching problem to the GOMA problem as the baseline algorithm.

Mining periodic behaviors of object movements for animal and biological sustainability studies,Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han; Bolin Ding; Roland Kays,Abstract Periodicity is one of the most frequently occurring phenomena for moving objects.Animals usually have periodic movement behaviors; such as daily foraging behaviors oryearly migration behaviors. Such periodic behaviors are the keys to understand animalmovement and they also reflect the seasonal; climate; or environmental changes of theecosystem. However; periodic behaviors could be complicated; involving multipleinterleaving periods; partial time span; and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper;we address the problem of mining periodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect the periods in complex movements; and how to mine periodicbehaviors. A period is usually a single value; such as 24 h. And a periodic behavior is astatistical description of the periodic movement for one specific period. For example; we …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,45
Discovering queries based on example tuples,Yanyan Shen; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Surajit Chaudhuri; Bolin Ding; Lev Novik,Abstract An enterprise information worker is often aware of a few example tuples (but not theentire result) that should be present in the output of the query. We study the problem ofdiscovering the minimal project join query that contains the given example tuples in itsoutput. Efficient discovery of such queries is challenging. We propose novel algorithms tosolve this problem. Our experiments on real-life datasets show that the proposed solution issignificantly more efficient compared with na\"{i} ve adaptations of known techniques.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,39
Online minimum matching in real-time spatial data: experiments and analysis,Yongxin Tong; Jieying She; Bolin Ding; Lei Chen; Tianyu Wo; Ke Xu,Abstract Recently; with the development of mobile Internet and smartphones; the< u> o</u>nline< u> m</u> inimum< u> b</u> ipartite< u> m</u> atching in real time spatial data(OMBM) problem becomes popular. Specifically; given a set of service providers withspecific locations and a set of users who dynamically appear one by one; the OMBMproblem is to find a maximum-cardinality matching with minimum total distance following thatonce a user appears; s/he must be immediately matched to an unmatched service provider;which cannot be revoked; before subsequent users arrive. To address this problem; existingstudies mainly focus on analyzing the worst-case competitive ratios of the proposed onlinealgorithms; but study on the performance of the algorithms in practice is absent. In thispaper; we present a comprehensive experimental comparison of the representative …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,37
ocast: Optimal multicast routing protocol for wireless sensor networks,Lu Su; Bolin Ding; Yong Yang; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Guohong Cao; Jennifer C Hou,In this paper; we describe oCast; an energy-optimal multicast routing protocol for wirelesssensor networks. The general minimum-energy multicast problem is NP-hard. Intermittentconnectivity that results from duty-cycling further complicates the problem. Nevertheless; wepresent both a centralized and distributed algorithm that are provably optimal when thenumber of destinations is small. This model is motivated by scenarios where sensors reportto a small number of base stations or where data needs to be replicated on a small numberof other nodes. We further propose an extended version of oCast; called Delay BoundedoCast (DB-oCast); which can discover optimal multicast trees under a predefined delaybound. Finally; we demonstrate the advantages of our schemes through both theoreticalanalysis and simulations.,Network Protocols; 2009. ICNP 2009. 17th IEEE International Conference on,2009,36

Topcells: Keyword-based search of top-k aggregated documents in text cube,Bolin Ding; Bo Zhao; Cindy Xide Lin; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai,Previous studies on supporting keyword queries in RDBMSs provide users with a ranked listof relevant linked structures (eg joined tuples) or individual tuples. In this paper; we aim tosupport keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension (s)(so-called text cube).Each document is associated with structural dimensions. A cell in the text cube aggregates aset of documents with matching dimension values on a subset of dimensions. Given akeyword query; our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells in the text cube. We propose arelevance scoring model and efficient ranking algorithms. Experiments are conducted toverify their efficiency.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,25
Quickr: Lazily approximating complex adhoc queries in bigdata clusters,Srikanth Kandula; Anil Shanbhag; Aleksandar Vitorovic; Matthaios Olma; Robert Grandl; Surajit Chaudhuri; Bolin Ding,Abstract We present a system that approximates the answer to complex ad-hoc queries inbig-data clusters by injecting samplers on-the-fly and without requiring pre-existing samples.Improvements can be substantial when big-data queries take multiple passes over data andwhen samplers execute early in the query plan. We present a new; universe; sampler whichis able to sample multiple join inputs. By incorporating samplers natively into a cost-basedquery optimizer; we automatically generate plans with appropriate samplers at appropriatelocations. We devise an accuracy analysis method using which we ensure that query planswith samplers will not miss groups and that aggregate values are within a small ratio of theirtrue value. An implementation on a cluster with tens of thousands of machines shows thatqueries in the TPC-DS benchmark use a median of 2X fewer resources.

Hierarchical aggregate classification with limited supervision for data reduction in wireless sensor networks,Lu Su; Jing Gao; Yong Yang; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract The main challenge of designing classification algorithms for sensor networks is thelack of labeled sensory data; due to the high cost of manual labeling in the harsh localeswhere a sensor network is normally deployed. Moreover; delivering all the sensory data tothe sink would cost enormous energy. Therefore; although some classification techniquescan deal with limited label information; they cannot be directly applied to sensor networkssince they are designed for centralized databases. To address these challenges; wepropose a hierarchical aggregate classification (HAC) protocol which can reduce theamount of data sent by each node while achieving accurate classification in the face ofinsufficient label information. In this protocol; each sensor node locally makes clusteranalysis and forwards only its decision to the parent node. The decisions are aggregated …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2011,22
Enabling privacy-preserving incentives for mobile crowd sensing systems,Haiming Jin; Lu Su; Bolin Ding; Klara Nahrstedt; Nikita Borisov,Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems thatleverage the public crowd equipped with various mobile devices (eg; smartphones;smartglasses; smartwatches) for large scale sensing tasks. Because of the importance ofincentivizing worker participation in such MCS systems; several auction-based incentivemechanisms have been proposed in past literature. However; these mechanisms fail toconsider the preservation of workers' bid privacy. Therefore; different from prior work; wepropose a differentially private incentive mechanism that preserves the privacy of eachworker's bid against the other honest-but-curious workers. The motivation of this designcomes from the concern that a worker's bid usually contains her private information thatshould not be disclosed. We design our incentive mechanism based on the single …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on,2016,21
Sample+ seek: Approximating aggregates with distribution precision guarantee,Bolin Ding; Silu Huang; Surajit Chaudhuri; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Chi Wang,Abstract Data volumes are growing exponentially for our decision-support systems making itchallenging to ensure interactive response time for ad-hoc queries without increasing cost ofhardware. Aggregation queries with Group By that produce an aggregate value for everycombination of values in the grouping columns are the most important class of ad-hocqueries. As small errors are usually tolerable for such queries; approximate queryprocessing (AQP) has the potential to answer them over very large datasets much faster.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,20
Query translation from XPath to SQL in the presence of recursive DTDs,Wenfei Fan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianzhong Li; Bolin Ding; Lu Qin,Abstract We study the problem of evaluating xp ath queries over xml data that is stored in anrdbms via schema-based shredding. The interaction between recursion (descendants-axis)in xp ath queries and recursion in dtd s makes it challenging to answer xp ath queries usingrdbms. We present a new approach to translating xp ath queries into sql queries based on anotion of extended XP ath expressions and a simple least fixpoint (lfp) operator. Extended xpath expressions are a mild extension of xp ath; and the lfp operator takes a single inputrelation and is already supported by most commercial rdbms. We show that extended xp athexpressions are capable of capturing both dtd recursion and xp ath queries in a uniformframework. Furthermore; they can be translated into an equivalent sequence of sql querieswith the lfp operator. We present algorithms for rewriting xp ath queries over a (possibly …,The VLDB Journal,2009,19
Attraction and avoidance detection from movements,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Fei Wu; Tobias Kin Hou Lei; Roland Kays; Margaret C Crofoot,Abstract With the development of positioning technology; movement data has becomewidely available nowadays. An important task in movement data analysis is to mine therelationships among moving objects based on their spatiotemporal interactions. Among allrelationship types; attraction and avoidance are arguably the most natural ones. However;rather surprisingly; there is no existing method that addresses the problem of miningsignificant attraction and avoidance relationships in a well-defined and unified framework. Inthis paper; we propose a novel method to measure the significance value of relationshipbetween any two objects by examining the background model of their movements viapermutation test. Since permutation test is computationally expensive; two effective pruningstrategies are developed to reduce the computation time.

Efficient keyword-based search for top-k cells in text cube,Bolin Ding; Bo Zhao; Cindy Xide Lin; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai; Asok Srivastava; Nikunj C Oza,Previous studies on supporting free-form keyword queries over RDBMSs provide users withlinked structures (eg; a set of joined tuples) that are relevant to a given keyword query. Mostof them focus on ranking individual tuples from one table or joins of multiple tablescontaining a set of keywords. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword search in adata cube with text-rich dimension (s)(so-called text cube). The text cube is built on amultidimensional text database; where each row is associated with some text data (adocument) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates aset of documents with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. We define akeyword-based query language and an IR-style relevance model for scoring/ranking cells inthe text cube. Given a keyword query; our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells.

Finding patterns in a knowledge base using keywords to compose table answers,Mohan Yang; Bolin Ding; Surajit Chaudhuri; Kaushik Chakrabarti,Abstract We aim to provide table answers to keyword queries using a knowledge base. Forqueries referring to multiple entities; like" Washington cities population" and" Mel Gibsonmovies"; it is better to represent each relevant answer as a table which aggregates a set ofentities or joins of entities within the same table scheme or pattern. In this paper; we studyhow to find highly relevant patterns in a knowledge base for user-given keyword queries tocompose table answers. A knowledge base is modeled as a directed graph calledknowledge graph; where nodes represent its entities and edges represent the relationshipsamong them. Each node/edge is labeled with type and text. A pattern is an aggregation ofsubtrees which contain all keywords in the texts and have the same structure and types onnode/edges. We propose efficient algorithms to find patterns that are relevant to the query …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,15

A statistical approach towards robust progress estimation,Arnd Christian König; Bolin Ding; Surajit Chaudhuri; Vivek Narasayya,Abstract The need for accurate SQL progress estimation in the context of decision supportadministration has led to a number of techniques proposed for this task. Unfortunately; nosingle one of these progress estimators behaves robustly across the variety of SQL queriesencountered in practice; meaning that each technique performs poorly for a significantfraction of queries. This paper proposes a novel estimator selection framework that uses astatistical model to characterize the sets of conditions under which certain estimatorsoutperform others; leading to a significant increase in estimation robustness. The generalityof this framework also enables us to add a number of novel" special purpose" estimatorswhich increase accuracy further. Most importantly; the resulting model generalizes well toqueries very different from the ones used to train it. We validate our findings using a large …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,15
Monitoring aggregate k-nn objects in road networks,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract In recent years; there is an increasing need to monitor k nearest neighbor (k-NN) ina road network. There are existing solutions on either monitoring k-NN objects from a singlequery point over a road network; or computing the snapshot k-NN objects over a roadnetwork to minimize an aggregate distance function with respect to multiple query points. Inthis paper; we study a new problem that is to monitor k-NN objects over a road network frommultiple query points to minimize an aggregate distance function with respect to the multiplequery points. We call it a continuous aggregate k-NN (CANN) query. We propose a newapproach that can significantly reduce the cost of computing network distances whenmonitoring aggregate k-NN objects on road networks.

S4: Top-k spreadsheet-style search for query discovery,Fotis Psallidas; Bolin Ding; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Surajit Chaudhuri,Abstract An enterprise information worker is often aware of a few example tuples that shouldbe present in the output of the query. Query discovery systems have been developed todiscover project-join queries that contain the given example tuples in their output. However;they require the output to exactly contain all the example tuples and do not perform anyranking. To address this limitation; we study the problem of efficiently discovering top-kproject join queries which approximately contain the given example tuples in their output.We extend our algorithms to incrementally produce results as soon as the user finishestyping/modifying a cell.

TEXplorer can beimplemented within a multi-dimensional text database; where each row is associated withstructural dimensions (attributes) and text data (eg; a document).

Scalable near real-time failure localization of data center networks,Herodotos Herodotou; Bolin Ding; Shobana Balakrishnan; Geoff Outhred; Percy Fitter,Abstract Large-scale data center networks are complex---comprising several thousandnetwork devices and several hundred thousand links---and form the critical infrastructureupon which all higher-level services depend on. Despite the built-in redundancy in datacenter networks; performance issues and device or link failures in the network can lead touser-perceived service interruptions. Therefore; determining and localizing user-impactingavailability and performance issues in the network in near real time is crucial. Traditionally;both passive and active monitoring approaches have been used for failure localization.However; data from passive monitoring is often too noisy and does not effectively capturesilent or gray failures; whereas active monitoring is potent in detecting faults but limited in itsability to isolate the exact fault location depending on its scale and granularity.

Mining significant time intervals for relationship detection,Zhenhui Li; Cindy Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatio-temporal data collected from GPS have become an important resource tostudy the relationships of moving objects. While previous studies focus on mining objectsbeing together for a long time; discovering real-world relationships; such as friends orcolleagues in human trajectory data; is a fundamentally different challenge. For example; itis possible that two individuals are friends but do not spend a lot of time being together everyday. However; spending just one or two hours together at a location away from work on aSaturday night could be a strong indicator of friend relationship. Based on the aboveobservations; in this paper we aim to analyze and detect semantically meaningfulrelationships in a supervised way. That is; with an interested relationship in mind; a user canlabel some object pairs with and without such relationship. From labeled pairs; we will …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,11
Cost-based query optimization for multi reachability joins,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding,Abstract There is a need to efficiently identify reachabilities between different types ofobjects over a large data graph. A reachability join (R-join) serves as a primitive operator forsuch a purpose. Given two types; A and D; R-join finds all pairs of A and D that D-typedobjects are reachable from some A-typed objects. In this paper; we focus on processingmulti reachability joins (R-joins). In the literature; the up-to-date approach extended the well-known twig-stack join algorithm; to be applicable on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Theefficiency of such an approach is affected by the density of large DAGs. In this paper; wepresent algorithms to optimize R-joins using a dynamic programming based on theestimated costs associated with R-join. Our algorithm is not affected by the density of graphs.We conducted extensive performance studies; and report our findings in our performance …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,9
Approximate query processing: no silver bullet,Surajit Chaudhuri; Bolin Ding; Srikanth Kandula,Abstract In this paper; we reflect on the state of the art of Approximate Query Processing.Although much technical progress has been made in this area of research; we are yet to seeits impact on products and services. We discuss two promising avenues to pursue towardsintegrating Approximate Query Processing into data platforms.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,8
Trust; but verify: Optimistic visualizations of approximate queries for exploring big data,Dominik Moritz; Danyel Fisher; Bolin Ding; Chi Wang,Abstract Analysts need interactive speed for exploratory analysis; but big data systems areoften slow. With sampling; data systems can produce approximate answers fast enough forexploratory visualization; at the cost of accuracy and trust. We propose optimisticvisualization; which approaches these issues from a user experience perspective. Thismethod lets analysts explore approximate results interactively; and provides a way to detectand recover from errors later. Pangloss implements these ideas. We discuss design issuesraised by optimistic visualization systems. We test this concept with five expert visualizers ina laboratory study and three case studies at Microsoft. Analysts reported that they felt moreconfident in their results; and used optimistic visualization to check that their preliminaryresults were correct.,Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2017,8
Optimizing index for taxonomy keyword search,Bolin Ding; Haixun Wang; Ruoming Jin; Jiawei Han; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Query substitution is an important problem in information retrieval. Much workfocuses on how to find substitutes for any given query. In this paper; we study how toefficiently process a keyword query whose substitutes are defined by a given taxonomy. Thisproblem is challenging because each term in a query can have a large number ofsubstitutes; and the original query can be rewritten into any of their combinations. Wepropose to build an additional index (besides inverted index) to efficiently process queries.For a query workload; we formulate an optimization problem which chooses the additionalindex structure; aiming at minimizing the query evaluation cost; under given index spaceconstraints. We show the NP-hardness of the problem; and propose a pseudo-polynomialtime algorithm using dynamic programming; as well as an 1 over 4 (1-1/e)-approximation …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,8

Flexible online task assignment in real-time spatial data,Yongxin Tong; Libin Wang; Zimu Zhou; Bolin Ding; Lei Chen; Jieping Ye; Ke Xu,Abstract The popularity of Online To Offline (O2O) service platforms has spurred the need foronline task assignment in real-time spatial data; where streams of spatially distributed tasksand workers are matched in real time such that the total number of assigned pairs ismaximized. Existing online task assignment models assume that each worker is eitherassigned a task immediately or waits for a subsequent task at a fixed location once she/heappears on the platform. Yet in practice a worker may actively move around rather thanpassively wait in place if no task is assigned. In this paper; we define a new problem< u>F</u> lexible< u> T</u> wo-sided< u> O</u> nline task< u> A</u> ssignment (FTOA).

Design of policy-aware differentially private algorithms,Samuel Haney; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Bolin Ding,Abstract The problem of designing error optimal differentially private algorithms is wellstudied. Recent work applying differential privacy to real world settings have used variants ofdifferential privacy that appropriately modify the notion of neighboring databases. Theproblem of designing error optimal algorithms for such variants of differential privacy is open.In this paper; we show a novel transformational equivalence result that can turn the problemof query answering under differential privacy with a modified notion of neighbors to one ofquery answering under standard differential privacy; for a large class of neighbor definitions.We utilize the Blowfish privacy framework that generalizes differential privacy. Blowfish usesa policy graph to instantiate different notions of neighboring databases. We show that theerror incurred when answering a workload W on a database x under a Blowfish policy …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
Bidirectional mining of non-redundant recurrent rules from a sequence database,David Lo; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,We are interested in scalable mining of a non-redundant set of significant recurrent rulesfrom a sequence database. Recurrent rules have the form “whenever a series of precedentevents occurs; eventually a series of consequent events occurs”. They are intuitive andcharacterize behaviors in many domains. An example is the domain of softwarespecification; in which the rules capture a family of properties beneficial to programverification and bug detection. We enhance a past work on mining recurrent rules by Lo;Khoo; and Liu to perform mining more scalably. We propose a new set of pruning propertiesembedded in a new mining algorithm. Performance and case studies on benchmarksynthetic and real datasets show that our approach is much more efficient and outperformsthe state-of-the-art approach in mining recurrent rules by up to two orders of magnitude.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,6

Stream mining,Jiawei Han; Bolin Ding,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,4
Fast set intersection,*,Described is a fast set intersection technology by which sets of elements to be intersectedare maintained as partitioned subsets (small groups) in data structures; along withrepresentative values (eg; one or more hash signatures) representing those subsets. Amathematical operation (eg; bitwise-AND) on the representative values indicates whether anintersection of range-overlapping subsets will be empty; without having to perform theintersection operation. If so; the intersection operation on those subsets may be skipped;with intersection operations (possibly guided by inverted mappings or using a linear scan)performed only on overlapping subsets that may have one or more intersecting elements.,*,2011,3
Finding patterns in a knowledge base to compose table answers,*,In general; the knowledge base table composer embodiments described herein providetable answers to keyword queries against one or more knowledge bases. Highly relevantpatterns in a knowledge base are found for user-given keyword queries. These patterns areused to compose table answers. To this end; a knowledge base is modeled as a directedgraph called a knowledge graph; where nodes represent entities in the knowledge base andedges represent the relationships among them. Each node/edge is labeled with a type andtext. A pattern that is an aggregation of subtrees which contain all keywords in the texts andhave the same structure and types on node/edges is sought. Patterns that are relevant to aquery for a class can be found using a set of scoring functions. Furthermore; path-basedindexes and various query-processing procedures can be employed to speed up …,*,2015,2
Making filters smart in distributed data stream environments,Cheqing Jin; Bolin Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Monitoring aggregate queries in real-time over distributed streaming environmentsappears to be a great challenge not only because of the huge data volume and high rate;but also because of the limitation of the network transmission bandwidth. Consequently;ensuring qualified approximate results with economical network consumption becomes oneof the most important goals in such scenarios. In this paper; we study how to monitoraggregate queries continuously over distributed environments efficiently by disposingnumerous filters at remote sites; in order to transmit only a small part of incoming data to thequery site and therefore save the network resource significantly. We also show how to adjustthe parameters of a filter continuously when the incoming data distribution at thecorresponding remote site changes.

Collecting Telemetry Data Privately,Bolin Ding; Janardhan Kulkarni; Sergey Yekhanin,Abstract The collection and analysis of telemetry data from user's devices is routinelyperformed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved userexperience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP)algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimatevarious population statistics; while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by suchalgorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection; but degraderapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular; existing LDP algorithms are notsuitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app usage statistics. In thispaper; we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards repeated collection of counterdata; with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2017,1

Aggregate-Query Database System and Processing,*,Abstract A processing unit can determine a first subset of a data set including data recordsselected based on measure values thereof. The processing unit can determine an indexmapping a predicate to data records associated with that predicate and approximationvalues of the records. The processing unit can process a query against the first subset toprovide a first result and a first accuracy value; determine that the first accuracy value doesnot satisfy an accuracy criterion; and process the query against the index. In someexamples; the processing unit can process the query against a second subset including datarecords satisfying a predetermined predicate. In some examples; the processing unit canreceive data records and determine the first subset. Data records can include respectivemeasure values. Data records with higher measure values can occur in the first subset …,*,2017,*
Controlling approximations of queries,*,One or more approximations of query output in a data analytics platform are controlled. Theone or more approximations are controlled by generating values of error metrics associatedwith placements of samplers in one or more query execution plans associated with thequery; and injecting a plurality of samplers into the query execution plans; using thedetermined values of the error metrics; in lieu of storing samples of input to the query prior toexecution of the query.,*,2017,*
Learn-Memorize-Recall-Reduce A Robotic Cloud Computing Paradigm,Shaoshan Liu; Bolin Ding; Jie Tang; Dawei Sun; Zhe Zhang; Grace Tsai; Jean-Luc Gaudiot,Abstract: The rise of robotic applications has led to the generation of a huge volume ofunstructured data; whereas the current cloud infrastructure was designed to process limitedamounts of structured data. To address this problem; we propose a learn-memorize-recall-reduce paradigm for robotic cloud computing. The learning stage converts incomingunstructured data into structured data; the memorization stage provides effective storage forthe massive amount of data; the recall stage provides efficient means to retrieve the rawdata; while the reduction stage provides means to make sense of this massive amount ofunstructured data with limited computing resources.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.04712,2017,*

Privacy-preserving data publishing and analytics using data cubes,Bolin Ding,Abstract Data cubes play an essential role in data analysis and decision support. In a datacube; data from a fact table is aggregated on subsets of the table's dimensions; forming acollection of smaller tables called cuboids. When the fact table includes sensitive data suchas salary or diagnosis; publishing even a subset of its cuboids may compromise individuals'privacy. In this thesis; we address several problems about privacy-preserving publishing ofdata cubes using differential privacy or its extensions; which provide privacy guarantees forindividuals by adding noise to query answers. The first problem is about how to improve thedata quality in privacy-preserving data cubes. Our noise-control frameworks choose noisesource in a data cube; ie; an initial subset of cuboids to compute directly from the fact tablewith certain amount of noise to be injected to each of them; and then compute the …,*,2012,*
KEYWORD SEARCH IN TEXT CUBE: FINDING TOP-K RELEVANT CELLS,Bolin Ding; Yintao Yu; Bo Zhao; Cindy Xide Lin; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai,Abstract. We study the problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s)(so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database; whereeach row is associated with some text data (eg; a document) and other structural dimensions(attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attributevalues in a subset of dimensions. A cell document is the concatenation of all documents in acell. Given a keyword query; our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells (rankedaccording to the relevance scores of cell documents wrt the given query) in the text cube. Wedefine a keyword-based query language and apply IR-style relevance model for scoring andranking cell documents in the text cube. We propose two efficient approaches to find the top-k answers. The proposed approaches support a general class of IR-style relevance …,Conference on Intelligent Data Understanding CIDU 2010,2010,*
