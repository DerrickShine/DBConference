Exemplar Queries: Give me an Example of What You Need,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Search engines are continuously employing advanced techniques that aim tocapture user intentions and provide results that go beyond the data that simply satisfy thequery conditions. Examples include the personalized results; related searches; similaritysearch; popular and relaxed queries. In this work we introduce a novel query paradigm thatconsiders a user query as an example of the data in which the user is interested. We callthese queries exemplar queries and claim that they can play an important role in dealingwith the information deluge. We provide a formal specification of the semantics of suchqueries and show that they are fundamentally different from notions like queries by example;approximate and related queries. We provide an implementation of these semantics forgraph-based data and present an exact solution with a number of optimizations that …,PVLDB,2014,59
A Probabilistic Optimization Framework for the Empty-Answer Problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with less conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. We analyze thesesolutions; experimentally verify their efficiency and effectiveness; and illustrate their …,PVLDB,2013,42
Searching with XQ: the eXemplar Query Search Engine,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract We demonstrate XQ; a query engine that implements a novel technique forsearching relevant information on the web and in various data sources; called ExemplarQueries. While the traditional query model expects the user to provide a set of specificationsthat the elements of interest need to satisfy; XQ expects the user to provide only an elementof interest and we infer the desired answer set based on that element. Through the variousexamples we demonstrate the functionality of the system and its applicability in variouscases. At the same time; we highlight the technical challenges for this type of queryanswering and illustrate the implementation approach we have materialized. The demo isintended for both researchers and practitioners and aims at illustrating the benefits of theadoption of this new form of query answering in practical applications and the further …,SIGMOD,2014,13
Entity ranking using click-log information,Davide Mottin; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Log information describing the items the users have selected from the set ofanswers a query engine returns to their queries constitute an excellent form of indirect userfeedback that has been extensively used in the web to improve the effectiveness of searchengines.,Intelligent Data Analysis,2013,13
IQR: An Interactive Query Relaxation System for the Empty-Answer Problem.,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We present IQR; a system that demonstrates optimization based interactiverelaxations for queries that return an empty answer. Given an empty answer; IQRdynamically suggests one relaxation of the original query conditions at a time to the user;based on certain optimization objectives; and the user responds by either accepting ordeclining the relaxation; until the user arrives at a non-empty answer; or a non-emptyanswer is impossible to achieve with any further relaxations. The relaxation suggestionshinge on a proba-bilistic framework that takes into account the probability of the useraccepting a suggested relaxation; as well as how much that relaxation serves towards theoptimization objec-tive. IQR accepts a wide variety of optimization objectives-user centricobjectives; such as; minimizing the number of user interactions (ie; effort) or returning …,SIGMOD,2014,11
Exemplar Queries: A New Way of Searching,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Modern search engines employ advanced techniques that go beyond the structuresthat strictly satisfy the query conditions in an effort to better capture the user intentions. In thiswork; we introduce a novel query paradigm that considers a user query as an example of thedata in which the user is interested. We call these queries exemplar queries. We provide aformal specification of their semantics and show that they are fundamentally different fromnotions like queries by example; approximate queries and related queries. We provide animplementation of these semantics for knowledge graphs and present an exact solution witha number of optimizations that improve performance without compromising the result quality.We study two different congruence relations; isomorphism and strong simulation; foridentifying the answers to an exemplar query.

Graph Query Reformulation With Diversity,Davide Mottin; Francesco Bonchi; Francesco Gullo,Abstract We study a problem of graph-query reformulation enabling explorative query-drivendiscovery in graph databases. Given a query issued by the user; the system; apart fromreturning the result patterns; also proposes a number of specializations (ie; supergraphs) ofthe original query to facilitate the exploration of the results. We formalize the problem offinding a set of reformulations of the input query by maximizing a linear combination ofcoverage (of the original query's answer set) and diversity among the specializations. Weprove that our problem is hard; but also that a simple greedy algorithm achieves a (1/2)-approximation guarantee.,KDD,2015,8
Unleashing the Power of Information Graphs,Matteo Lissandrini; Davidel Mottin; Dimitra Papadimitriou; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Information graphs are generic graphs that model different types of informationthrough nodes and edges. Knowledge graphs are the most common type of informationgraphs in which nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships among them. Inthis paper; we argue that exploitation of information graphs can lead into novel queryanswering capabilities that go beyond the existing capabilities of keyword search; and focuson one of them; namely; exemplar queries. Exemplar queries is a recently introducedparadigm that treats a user query as an example from the desired result set. In this paper; wedescribe the foundations of exemplar queries and the significant role of information graphs;and we present several applications and relevant research directions.,SIGMOD Record,2014,6

New Trends on Exploratory Methods for Data Analytics,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Data usually comes in a plethora of formats and dimensions; rendering theexploration and information extraction processes cumbersome. Thus; being able to castexploratory queries in the data with the intent of having an immediate glimpse on some ofthe data properties is becoming crucial. An exploratory query should be simple enough toavoid complicate declarative languages (such as SQL) and mechanisms; and at the sametime retain the flexibility and expressiveness of such languages. Recently; we havewitnessed a rediscovery of the so called example-based methods; in which the user; or theanalyst circumvent query languages by using examples as input. An example is arepresentative of the intended results; or in other words; an item from the result set. Example-based methods exploit inherent characteristics of the data to infer the results that the user …,VLDB,2017,2

It has a very important application in different domainslike that of information retrieval; data mining; genomics etc. Obviously keyword queries arepreferred by users because they are based on natural language. Even though this point is aplus from the users point of view; it is a challenge from the machines perspective. This is becauseof the fact that natural languages are ambiguous and …,*,2013,2
Large graph exploration,Davide Mottin,The increasing interest in social networks; protein-interaction; and many other types ofnetworks has raised the question how users can explore such large and complex graphstructures in an intuitive way. Nowadays; these networks count billions of nodes andrelationships and are used to study complex phenomena; such as social behaviors;marketing campaigns; and economic factors. Given this complexity and size; interactivealgorithms would assist the human in finding interesting information in graphs easily.Interactive algorithms and exploratory methods have been studied for more traditional data;such as relation; semi-structured; and textual data; to allow intuitive data exploration.However; there is no counterpart for graphs. We propose graph exploration; a novel groundof research that includes the user in the algorithms to allow interactive access to large …,Proceedings of the 10th Ph. D.

MetaExp: Interactive Explanation and Exploration of Large Knowledge Graphs,Freya Behrens; Sebastian Bischoff; Pius Ladenburger; Julius Rückin; Laurenz Seidel; Fabian Stolp; Michael Vaichenker; Adrian Ziegler; Davide Mottin; Fatemeh Aghaei; Emmanuel Müller; Martin Preusse; Nikola Müller; Michael Hunger,ABSTRACT We present MetaExp; a system that assists the user during the exploration oflarge knowledge graphs; given two sets of initial nodes. At its core; MetaExp presents asmall set of meta-paths to the user; which are sequences of relationships among node types.Such meta-paths do not overwhelm the user with complex structures; yet they preservesemantically-rich relationships in a graph. MetaExp engages the user in an interactiveprocedure; which involves simple meta-paths evaluations to infer a user-specific similaritymeasure. This similarity measure incorporates the domain knowledge and the preferencesof the user; overcoming the fundamental limitations of previous methods based on localnode neighborhoods or statically determined similarity scores. Our system provides auserfriendly interface for searching initial nodes and guides the user towards progressive …,*,2018,*

Notable Characteristics Search through Knowledge Graphs,Davide Mottin; Bastian Grasnick; Axel Kroschk; Patrick Siegler; Emmanuel Müller,Abstract: Query answering routinely employs knowledge graphs to assist the user in thesearch process. Given a knowledge graph that represents entities and relationships amongthem; one aims at complementing the search with intuitive but effective mechanisms. Inparticular; we focus on the comparison of two or more entities and the detection ofunexpected; surprising properties; called notable characteristics. Such characteristicsprovide intuitive explanations of the peculiarities of the selected entities with respect tosimilar entities. We propose a solid probabilistic approach that first retrieves entity nodessimilar to the query nodes provided by the user; and then exploits distributional properties tounderstand whether a certain attribute is interesting or not. Our preliminary experimentsdemonstrate the solidity of our approach and show that we are able to discover notable …,EDBT,2018,*

VERSE: Versatile Graph Embeddings from Similarity Measures,Anton Tstitsulin; Davide Mottin; Panos Karras; Emmanuel Müller,ABSTRACT Embedding a web-scale information network into a low-dimensional vectorspace facilitates tasks such as link prediction; classification; and visualization. Past researchhas addressed the problem of extracting such embeddings by adopting methods from wordsto graphs; without defining a clearly comprehensible graph-related objective. Yet; as weshow; the objectives used in past works implicitly utilize similarity measures among graphnodes. In this paper; we carry the similarity orientation of previous works to its logicalconclusion; we propose VERtex Similarity Embeddings (VERSE); a simple; versatile; andmemory-efficient method that derives graph embeddings explicitly calibrated to preserve thedistributions of a selected vertex-to-vertex similarity measure. VERSE learns suchembeddings by training a single-layer neural network. While its default; scalable version …,WWW,2018,*
Beyond Frequencies: Graph Pattern Mining in Multi-weighted Graphs.,Giulia Preti; Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Yannis Velegrakis,ABSTRACT Graph pattern mining aims at identifying structures that appear frequently inlarge graphs; under the assumption that frequency signifies importance. Several measuresof frequency have been proposed that respect the apriori property; essential for an efficientsearch of the patterns. This property states that the number of appearances of a pattern in agraph cannot be larger than the frequency of any of its sub-patterns. In real life; there aremany graphs with weights on nodes and/or edges. For these graphs; it is fair that theimportance (score) of a pattern is determined not only by the number of its appearances; butalso by the weights on the nodes/edges of those appearances. Scoring functions based onthe weights do not generally satisfy the apriori property; thus forcing many approaches toemploy other; less efficient; pruning strategies to speed up the computation. The problem …,EDBT,2018,*
Graph Exploration: From Users to Large Graphs,Davide Mottin; Emmanuel Müller,Abstract The increasing interest in social networks; knowledge graphs; protein-interaction;and many other types of networks has raised the question how users can explore such largeand complex graph structures easily. Current tools focus on graph management; graphmining; or graph visualization but lack user-driven methods for graph exploration. In manycases graph methods try to scale to the size and complexity of a real network. However;methods miss user requirements such as exploratory graph query processing; intuitivegraph explanation; and interactivity in graph exploration. While there is consensus indatabase and data mining communities on the definition of data exploration practices forrelational and semi-structured data; graph exploration practices are still indeterminate. Inthis tutorial; we will discuss a set of techniques; which have been developed in the last …,SIGMOD,2017,*
Advanced Query Paradigms for the Novice User,Davide Mottin,Query answering is one of the most important processes in search systems; for it connectsusers to the information stored in data sources. A query is a set of specifications orconstraints that the user provides to describe the objects of interest. As such; answering aquery means retrieving those objects from the data source that match the user constraints.An answer from a search system may not fully satisfy the user. This happens if the answerdoes not contain the required object or it contains a number of irrelevant results. Commonly;the user does not know how to describe the query and ends up with one overly generic orspecific or; even worse; she is not even aware of the correct conditions to describe theexpected results. These problems are particularly evident when the database is interrogatedby a novice user who; by definition; does not have sufficient technological skills to …,*,2015,*
