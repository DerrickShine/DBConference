A fast coarse filtering method for peptide identification by mass spectrometry,Smriti R Ramakrishnan; Rui Mao; Aleksey A Nakorchevskiy; John T Prince; Willard S Willard; Weijia Xu; Edward M Marcotte; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Motivation: We reformulate the problem of comparing mass-spectra by mappingspectra to a vector space model. Our search method leverages a metric space indexingalgorithm to produce an initial candidate set; which can be followed by any fine rankingscheme. Results: We consider three distance measures integrated into a multi-vantage pointindex structure. Of these; a semi-metric fuzzy-cosine distance using peptide precursor massconstraints performs the best. The index acts as a coarse; lossless filter with respect to theSEQUEST and ProFound scoring schemes; reducing the number of distance computationsand returned candidates for fine filtering to about 0.5% and 0.02% of the databaserespectively. The fuzzy cosine distance term improves specificity over a peptide precursormass filter; reducing the number of returned candidates by an order of magnitude. Run …,Bioinformatics,2006,48
Overcoming the challenge of variety: big data abstraction; the next evolution of data management for AAL communication systems,Rui Mao; Honglong Xu; Wenbo Wu; Jianqiang Li; Yan Li; Minhua Lu,With the extensive use of information technology in AAL communication systems; a datamanagement model has recently embodied the 3-V characteristics of big data: volume;velocity; and variety. A lot of work has been done on volume and velocity; but not as muchhas been reported on variety. To handle the variety of data; universal solutions withacceptable performance are usually much more cost effective than customized solutions. Toachieve universality; a basic idea is to first define a universal abstraction that covers a widerange of data types; and then build a universal system for universal abstraction. Traditionaldatabase management systems commonly use a multidimensional data type; or featurevectors; as a universal abstraction. However; many new data types in AAL systems cannotbe abstracted into multidimensional space. To find a more universal data abstraction and …,IEEE Communications Magazine,2015,47
Influential community search in large networks,Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,Abstract Community search is a problem of finding densely connected subgraphs that satisfythe query conditions in a network; which has attracted much attention in recent years.However; all the previous studies on community search do not consider the influence of acommunity.

Efficient core maintenance in large dynamic graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,The k-core decomposition in a graph is a fundamental problem for social network analysis.The problem of k-core decomposition is to calculate the core number for every node in agraph. Previous studies mainly focus on k-core decomposition in a static graph. There existsa linear time algorithm for k-core decomposition in a static graph. However; in many real-world applications such as online social networks and the Internet; the graph typicallyevolves overtime. In such applications; a key issue is to maintain the core numbers of nodeswhen the graph changes overtime. A simple implementation is to perform the linear timealgorithm to recompute the core number for every node after the graph is updated. Suchsimple implementation is expensive when the graph is very large. In this paper; we proposea new efficient algorithm to maintain the core number for every node in a dynamic graph …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,45
Fine-grained localization for multiple transceiver-free objects by using RF-based technologies,Dian Zhang; Kezhong Lu; Rui Mao; Yuhong Feng; Yunhuai Liu; Zhong Ming; Lionel M Ni,In traditional radio-based localization methods; the target object has to carry a transmitter(eg; active RFID); a receiver (eg; 802.11× detector); or a transceiver (eg; sensor node).However; in some applications; such as safe guard systems; it is not possible to meet thisprecondition. In this paper; we propose a model of signal dynamics to allow the tracking of atransceiver-free object. Based on radio signal strength indicator (RSSI); which is readilyavailable in wireless communication; three centralized tracking algorithms; and onedistributed tracking algorithm are proposed to eliminate noise behaviors and improveaccuracy. The midpoint and intersection algorithms can be applied to track a single objectwithout calibration; while the best-cover algorithm has higher tracking accuracy but requirescalibration. The probabilistic cover algorithm is based on distributed dynamic clustering. It …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2014,42
Relay node placement based on balancing power consumption in wireless sensor networks,Kezhong Lu; Gang Liu; Rui Mao; Yuchun Feng,To alleviate the traffic burden of sensor nodes and extend the network lifetime in wirelesssensor networks; one approach is to deploy a large number of low-cost micro-relay nodesfor routing data. The question is how to deploy a minimum number of relay nodes in thesensing field with network lifetime constraint. If relay nodes are uniformly placed; the issue ofuneven power consumption arises as relay nodes closer to the sink are required to relaymore data and thus will deplete their energy more quickly. Here; the authors study the relaynode deployment problem under the assumption that the relay node has the same energysupply as the sensor node. Based on balancing power consumption among all sensornodes and relay nodes; the authors deduce a relay node density function according to whichrelay nodes are placed in the sensing field. Simulation results show that the approach …,IET wireless sensor systems,2011,35
An assessment of a metric space database index to support sequence homology,Rui Mao; Weijia Xu; Neha Singh; Daniel P Miranker,Hierarchical metric-space clustering methods have been commonly used to organizeproteomes into taxonomies. Consequently; it is often anticipated that hierarchical clusteringcan be leveraged as a basis for scalable database index structures capable of managing thehyper-exponential growth of sequence data. M-tree is one such data structure specializedfor the management of large data sets on disk. We explore the application of M-trees to thestorage and retrieval of peptide sequence data. Exploiting a technique first suggested byMyers; we organize the database as records of fixed length substrings. Empirical results arepromising. However; metric-space indexes are subject to" the curse of dimensionality" andthe ultimate performance of an index is sensitive to the quality of the initial construction of theindex. We introduce new hierarchical bulk-load algorithm that alternates between top …,International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools,2005,32
Diversity-aware retrieval of medical records,Jianqiang Li; Chunchen Liu; Bo Liu; Rui Mao; Yongcai Wang; Shi Chen; Ji-Jiang Yang; Hui Pan; Qing Wang,Abstract The widely adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) causes an explosivegrowth of the medical and clinical data. It makes the medical search technologies becomecritical to find useful patient information in the large medical dataset. However; the highquality medical search is a challenging task; in particular due to the inherent complexity andambiguity of medical terminology. In this paper; by exploiting the uncertainty in ambiguousmedical queries; we propose a novel semantic-based approach to achieve the diversity-aware retrieval of EMRs; ie; both the relevance and novelty are considered for EMR ranking.With the support of medical domain ontologies; we first mine all the potential semantics(concepts and relations between them) from a user query and consume them to model themultiple query aspects. Then; we propose a novel diversification strategy; which …,Computers in Industry,2015,26
On optimizing distance-based similarity search for biological databases,Rui Mao; Weijia Xu; Smriti Ramakrishnan; Glen Nuckolls; Daniel P Miranker,Similarity search leveraging distance-based index structures is increasingly being used forboth multimedia and biological database applications. We consider distance-basedindexing for three important biological data types; protein k-mers with the metric PAM model;DNA k-mers with Hamming distance and peptide fragmentation spectra with a pseudo-metric derived from cosine distance. To date; the primary driver of this research has beenmultimedia applications; where similarity functions are often Euclidean norms on highdimensional feature vectors. We develop results showing that the character of thesebiological workloads is different from multimedia workloads. In particular; they are notintrinsically very high dimensional; and deserving different optimization heuristics.

Pivot selection for metric-space indexing,Rui Mao; Peihan Zhang; Xingliang Li; Xi Liu; Minhua Lu,Abstract Metric-space indexing abstracts various data types into universal metric spaces andprunes data only exploiting the triangle inequality of the distance function in metric spaces.Since there is no coordinates in metric space; one usually first pick a number of referencepoints; pivots; and consider the distances from a data point to the pivots as its coordinates. Inthis paper; we first survey and discuss the state of the art of pivot selection for metric-spaceindexing from the perspectives of importance; objective function; number of pivots; andselection algorithm. Further; we propose a new objective function; a new method todetermine the number of pivots and an incremental sampling framework for pivot selection.Experimental results show that the new objective function is more consistent with the queryperformance; the new method to determine the number of pivots is more efficient; and the …,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,2016,25
Mobios: a metric-space dbms to support biological discovery,Daniel Miranker; Weijia Xu; Rui Mao,MoBIoS is a specialized database management system whose storage manager is basedon metricspace indexing; and whose query language entails biological data types. Whenrelational database management systems are used to support biological data; importantdata types are relegated to blob and unstructured text fields. Thus; even simple; but criticalqueries are executed by sequentially dumping the data to utilities outside the database.MoBIoS provides O (log n) physical access to diverse biological data types as well asuniform logical and syntactic access. Consequently; MoBIoS provides a framework wherecomplex bioinformatic algorithms may be effectively expressed and executed as concisedeclarative SQL-like (Structured Query Language) queries.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,25
Localization algorithm based on maximum a posteriori in wireless sensor networks,Kezhong Lu; Xiaohua Xiang; Dian Zhang; Rui Mao; Yuhong Feng,Many applications and protocols in wireless sensor networks need to know the locations ofsensor nodes. A low-cost method to localize sensor nodes is to use received signal strengthindication (RSSI) ranging technique together with the least-squares trilateration. However;the average localization error of this method is large due to the large ranging error of RSSIranging technique. To reduce the average localization error; we propose a localizationalgorithm based on maximum a posteriori. This algorithm uses the Baye's formula to deducethe probability density of each sensor node's distribution in the target region from RSSIvalues. Then; each sensor node takes the point with the maximum probability density as itsestimated location. Through simulation studies; we show that this algorithm outperforms theleast-squares trilateration with respect to the average localization error.,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,2011,23
Pivot selection: Dimension reduction for distance-based indexing,Rui Mao; Willard L Miranker; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Distance-based indexing exploits only the triangle inequality to answer similarityqueries in metric spaces. Lacking coordinate structure; mathematical tools in R n can onlybe applied indirectly; making it difficult to theoretically study metric-space indexing. Towardsolving this problem; a common algorithmic step is to select a small number of specialpoints; called pivots; and map the data objects to a low-dimensional space; one dimensionfor each pivot; where each dimension represents the distances of a pivot to the data objects.We formalize a “pivot space model” where all the data objects are used as pivots such thatdata is mapped from metric space to R n; preserving all the pairwise distances under L∞.With this model; it can be shown that the indexing problem in metric space can beequivalently studied in R n. Further; we show the necessity of dimension reduction for R n …,Journal of Discrete Algorithms,2012,22
On random walk based graph sampling,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Rui Mao; Tan Jin,Random walk based graph sampling has been recognized as a fundamental technique tocollect uniform node samples from a large graph. In this paper; we first present acomprehensive analysis of the drawbacks of three widely-used random walk based graphsampling algorithms; called re-weighted random walk (RW) algorithm; Metropolis-Hastingsrandom walk (MH) algorithm and maximum-degree random walk (MD) algorithm. Then; toaddress the limitations of these algorithms; we propose two general random walk basedalgorithms; named rejection-controlled Metropolis-Hastings (RCMH) algorithm andgeneralized maximum-degree random walk (GMD) algorithm. We show that RCMHbalances the tradeoff between the limitations of RW and MH; and GMD balances the tradeoffbetween the drawbacks of RW and MD.

Efficient and accurate query evaluation on uncertain graphs via recursive stratified sampling,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao; Tan Jin,In this paper; we introduce two types of query evaluation problems on uncertain graphs:expectation query evaluation and threshold query evaluation. Since these two problemsare# P-complete; most previous solutions for these problems are based on naive Monte-Carlo (NMC) sampling. However; NMC typically leads to a large variance; which significantlyreduces its effectiveness. To overcome this problem; we propose two classes of estimators;called class-I and class-II estimators; based on the idea of stratified sampling. Morespecifically; we first propose two classes of basic stratified sampling estimators; named BSS-I and BSS-II; which partition the entire population into 2 r and r+ 1 strata by picking r edgesrespectively. Second; to reduce the variance; we find that both BSS-I and BSS-II can berecursively performed in each stratum. Therefore; we propose two classes of recursive …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,13
Approximation algorithm for minimizing relay node placement in wireless sensor networks,KeZhong Lu; GuoLiang Chen; YuHong Feng; Gang Liu; Rui Mao,Abstract To eliminate the routing load unbalance among sensor nodes; one approach is todeploy a small number of powerful relay nodes acting as routing nodes in wireless sensornetworks; the major optimization objective of which is to minimize the number of relay nodesrequired. In this paper; we prove that the relay node placement problem in a bounded planeis a P problem; but its computational complexity in general case is quite great. From thegeometric cover feature of the relay node placement problem; an O (n 2 log n) time greedyapproximation algorithm is proposed; where n is the number of sensor nodes. Particularly; ateach stage of this algorithm's iterative process; we first select a critical node from uncoveredsensor nodes; and then determine the location of relay node based on the principle ofpreferring to cover the sensor node closer to the critical node; so as to prevent the …,Science China Information Sciences,2010,12
Indexing protein sequences in metric space,Weijia Xu; Daniel P Miranker; Rui Mao; Shu Wang,Abstract The hyper-exponential growth of biological sequence data and complex queriesdemand new approaches of managing sequence databases where sequence data ispreprocessed off-line and organized in data structures such that on-line queries can beexecuted quickly. Due to the complications of computing biological similarity based on localalignments; such index structures are typically constructed on q-grams (substrings of lengthq) and embody a three-way trade-off between speed; accuracy and scalability. Thedevelopment of a biologically effective distance metric on amino-acid substitution; mPAM;permits this approach to be extended beyond direct nucleotide comparison to codonsimilarity and protein sequences. We consider the storage and retrieval of protein q-gramsusing a metric-space index structure; the MVP-tree. Using a controlled sequence …,Submitted for publication,2003,12

Dimension reduction for distance-based indexing,Rui Mao; Willard L Miranker; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Distance-based indexing exploits only the triangle inequality to answer similarityqueries in metric spaces. Lacking of coordinate structure; mathematical tools in R n can onlybe applied indirectly; making it difficult for theoretical study in metric space indexing. Towardsolving this problem; we formalize a" pivot space model" where data is mapped from metricspace to R n; preserving all the pair wise distances under L infin;. With this model; it can beshown that the indexing problem in metric space can be equivalently studied in R n. Further;we show the necessity of dimension reduction for R n and that the only effective form ofdimension reduction is to select existing dimensions; ie pivot selection.

Normally; there is a trade-off betweenprecision and computational cost. In this study; we present a framework combined with blockmatching algorithm (BMA) and phase shift method with prior estimation (PSPE). BMA is firstapplied to the RF signals; the axial and lateral displacements obtained are then used as aprior estimates of the PS method to calculate a more precision axial displacements. Theperformance of the algorithm is evaluated with synthetic ultrasound RF data; and it is foundthat both SNRe and CNRe of our method are significantly higher than those of phase-shift asa prior estimation (PSPE) method.

Examples include full genome comparisons andphylogenetic footprinting. Simple identification of homologous sequences based on BLASTsearches is now just one option for querying the contents of a sequence database.

Quantitative imaging of Young’s Modulus of Soft tissues from ultrasound water jet indentation: a finite element study,Min-Hua Lu; Rui Mao; Yin Lu; Zheng Liu; Tian-Fu Wang; Si-Ping Chen,Indentation testing is a widely used approach to evaluate mechanical characteristics of softtissues quantitatively. Young's modulus of soft tissue can be calculated from the force-deformation data with known tissue thickness and Poisson's ratio using Hayes' equation.Our group previously developed a noncontact indentation system using a water jet as a softindenter as well as the coupling medium for the propagation of high-frequency ultrasound.The novel system has shown its ability to detect the early degeneration of articular cartilage.However; there is still lack of a quantitative method to extract the intrinsic mechanicalproperties of soft tissue from water jet indentation.

Optimal multi-meeting-point route search,Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,Real-time ride-sharing applications (eg; Uber and Lyft) are very popular in recent years.Motivated by the ride-sharing application; we propose a new type of query in road networks;called the optimal multi-meeting-point route (OMMPR) query. Given a road network G; asource nodes; a target node t; and a set of query nodes U; the OMMPR query aims at findingthe best route starting from s and ending at t such that the weighted average cost betweenthe cost of the route and the total cost of the shortest paths from every query node to theroute is minimized. We show that the problem of computing the OMMPR query is NP-hard.To answer the OMMPR query efficiently; we propose two novel parameterized solutionsbased on dynamic programming (DP); with the number of query nodes l (ie; l=| U|) as aparameter; which is typically very small in practice.

On data partitioning in tree structure metric-space indexes,Rui Mao; Sheng Liu; Honglong Xu; Dian Zhang; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Tree structure metric-space indexing methods recursively partition data accordingto their distances to a set of selected reference points (also called pivots). There are twobasic forms of data partitioning: ball partition and General Hyper-plane (GH) partition. Mostexisting work only shows their superiority experimentally; and little theoretical proof is found.We propose an approach to unify existing data partitioning methods and analyze theirperformance theoretically. First; in theory; we unify the two basic forms of partitioning byproving that there are rotations of each other. Second; we show several theoretical orexperimental results; which are able to indicate that ball partition outperforms GH partition.Our work takes a step forward in the theoretical study of metric-space indexing and is able togive a guideline of future index design.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,6
Case study: Distance-based image retrieval in the MoBIoS DBMS,Rui Mao; Wenguo Liu; Daniel P Miranker; Qasim Iqbal,Similarity search leveraging distance-based index structures is increasingly being used forcomplex data types.

Information mining in weighted complex networks with nonlinear rating projection,Hao Liao; An Zeng; Mingyang Zhou; Rui Mao; Bing-Hong Wang,Abstract Weighted rating networks are commonly used by e-commerce providers nowadays.In order to generate an objective ranking of online items' quality according to users' ratings;many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the complex networks domain. In thispaper; instead of proposing new algorithms we focus on a more fundamental problem: thenonlinear rating projection. The basic idea is that even though the rating values given byusers are linearly separated; the real preference of users to items between the differentgiven values is nonlinear. We thus design an approach to project the original ratings ofusers to more representative values. This approach can be regarded as a data pretreatmentmethod. Simulation in both artificial and real networks shows that the performance of theranking algorithms can be improved when the projected ratings are used.,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,2017,5

In this paper; we first introduce two types of query evaluation problems on uncertaingraphs; named expectation query evaluation and threshold query evaluation. Most previoussolutions for these problems are based on naive Monte-Carlo (NMC) sampling; whichtypically result in large variances. To reduce the variance of NMC; we propose two efficientestimators; called RSS-I and RSS-II estimators; based on the idea of recursive stratifiedsampling (RSS). To further reduce the variances of RSS-I and RSS-II; we propose arecursive cut-set based stratified sampling estimator for a particular kind of query evaluationproblem.

An inverted index for mass spectra similarity query and comparison with a metric-space method: case study,Rui Mao; Smriti R Ramakrishnan; Glen Nuckolls; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Query performance is a determining factor in the adoption of an indexing method forsimilarity query. Metric space indexing methods take great pride in their generalapplicability. However; it is usually hard for a general method to perform well for everydomain. Therefore; it is of interest to investigate the performance of metric-space methods;comparing with domain specific methods; on a particular domain. This paper describes suchan investigation for proteomic mass spectra. An inverted index method that exploits thesparsity of mass spectra binary format data and acts as a coarse filter before fine ranking isproposed and empirically compared with an existing metric-space indexing method.

In support of these applications; we explored a search strategy for k-nearestneighbor searches with MVP-trees that greedily identifies k answers and then improves theanswer set monotonically. The algorithm returns an approximate solution when terminatedearly; as determined by a limiting radius or an internal measure of progress.

On integrating peptide sequence analysis and relational distance-based indexing,Weijia Xu; Rui Mao; Shu Wang; Daniel P Miranker,Managing data with distance-based indexing methods has the potential to providescalability and integration with relational database management systems and the SQLprogramming model. We previously demonstrated the advantages of such an approach fornucleotide sequences using Hamming distance (mismatch). However; the larger alphabetsize of peptide sequences increases the dimensionality of the problem; making algorithmicresults more challenging. The development of a metric-PAM substitution matrix enablesmetric-distance based indexing for peptide sequences. The performance of distance-basedindexing for homologous protein retrieval entails trade-off among accuracy; scalability andcomputational cost.

Efficient and progressive group steiner tree search,Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,Abstract The Group Steiner Tree (GST) problem is a fundamental problem in database areathat has been successfully applied to keyword search in relational databases and teamsearch in social networks. The state-of-the-art algorithm for the GST problem is aparameterized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm; which finds the optimal tree in O (3 kn+ 2 k (n log n+ m)) time; where k is the number of given groups; m and n are the number ofthe edges and nodes of the graph respectively. The major limitations of the parameterizedDP algorithm are twofold:(i) it is intractable even for very small values of k (eg; k= 8) in largegraphs due to its exponential complexity; and (ii) it cannot generate a solution until thealgorithm has completed its entire execution.

Precise transceiver-free localization in complex indoor environment,Rui Mao; Peng Xiang; Dian Zhang,Transceiver-free object localization can localize target through using Radio Frequency (RF)technologies without carrying any device; which attracts many researchers' attentions. Mosttraditional technologies usually first deploy a number of reference nodes which are able tocommunicate with each other; then select only some wireless links; whose signals areaffected the most by the transceiver-free target; to estimate the target position. However;such traditional technologies adopt an ideal model for the target; the other link informationand environment interference behavior are not considered comprehensively. In order toovercome this drawback; we propose a method which is able to precisely estimate thetransceiver-free target position. It not only can leverage more link information; but also takeenvironmental interference into account. Two algorithms are proposed in our system; one …,China Communications,2016,2

MoBIoS index: Support distance-based queries in bioinformatics,Rui Mao; Weijia Xu; Willard S Willard; Smriti R Ramakrishnan; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract: Given a database; answering a distance-based query means retrieving all the dataobjects in the database that are in close proximity to a query object. Proximity is defined byany metric distance function. Close can mean within a certain distance; a range query; k-nearest neighbor or the two in combination. Answering distance-based queries is afundamental component of many biological applications; including sequence homology;protein identification by spectral database look-up and biomedical image retrieval. Mostsystems for retrieving similar biological data objects are domain-specific. For each newmodel of similarity the retrieval problem must be revisited.(Metric) distance-based indexingonly requires that the data can be abstracted into metric space; enabling the reuse of thesame software package for many problems.

We ultimately implement two queries in mSQL to showthat; not only can biologically valid analyses be expressed in concise mSQL queries; suchqueries can be optimized in the same ways as those relying on a standard relationalalgebra.,Department of Computer Sciences; University of Texas at Austin; Austin,2005,2
On Index Methods for an Image Database,Rui Mao; Wenguo Liu; Qasim Iqbal; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract We investigate the performance of three index structures to support scalableproximity retrieval of images. The development of a general purpose tree-structureddatabase index to support proximity search in metric space with formal O (log n)performance guarantees has eluded researchers. Consequently; there has been aproliferation of heuristic-based index methods whose performance must be evaluated withrespect to individual workloads. We measure the performance and scalability of twovariations of M-Trees and Multi-Vantage-Point Trees loaded isotropic and anisotropic imagedescriptors.,*,2003,2
A parallel computing framework for big data,Guoliang Chen; Rui Mao; Kezhong Lu,Abstract Big data has received great attention in research and application. However; most ofthe current efforts focus on system and application to handle the challenges of “volume” and“velocity”; and not much has been done on the theoretical foundation and to handle thechallenge of “variety”. Based on metric-space indexing and computationalcomplexity theory;we propose a parallel computing framework for big data. This framework consists of threecomponents; ie; universal representation of big data by abstracting various data types intometric space; partitioning of big data based on pair-wise distances in metric space; andparallel computing of big data with the NC-class computing theory.,Frontiers of Computer Science,2017,1
Efficient distance-based representative skyline computation in 2D space,Rui Mao; Taotao Cai; Rong-Hua Li; Jeffery Xu Yu; Jianxin Li,Abstract Representative skyline computation is a fundamental issue in database area; whichhas attracted much attention in recent years.

Hidden space reconstruction inspires link prediction in complex networks,Hao Liao; Mingyang Zhou; Zong-Wen Wei; Rui Mao; Alexandre Vidmer; Yi-Cheng Zhang,Abstract: As a fundamental challenge in vast disciplines; link prediction aims to identifypotential links in a network based on the incomplete observed information; which has broadapplications ranging from uncovering missing protein-protein interaction to predicting theevolution of networks. One of the most influential methods rely on similarity indicescharacterized by the common neighbors or its variations. We construct a hidden spacemapping a network into Euclidean space based solely on the connection structures of anetwork. Compared with real geographical locations of nodes; our reconstructed locationsare in conformity with those real ones. The distances between nodes in our hidden spacecould serve as a novel similarity metric in link prediction.

SQL extensions and database mechanisms for managing biosequences,Willard J Briggs; Wenguo Liu; Rui Mao; Weijia Xu; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Biologically effective retrieval and analysis of sequences entails much more thanfinding matching strings. While identification and storage of biological sequences usuallycomprises long functional units (eg genes; proteins and chromosomes); the analysis andretrieval of those sequences is primarily concerned with finding ordered sets of shortmatching subsequences (qgrams). This characterization applies both to homology searchalgorithms; ie; BLAST searches; as well as a growing toolkit of algorithms in comparativegenomics that are tantamount to executing joins on pairs of whole genome sequences(whole genome joins). To support these two logical views of sequence data; we introducemSQL; a set of extensions to SQL92. We have implemented mSQL as a component ofMoBIoS; the Molecular Biological Information System.

Metric-space search of protein sequence databases,Weijia Xu; Rui Mao; Shu Wang; Daniel P Miranker,Abstract Motivation: Growing sequence databases are instigating sequence retrievalsystems that construct k-mer (hot-spot) indexes off-line to speed up the on-line queryexecution. For fixed k; the content of each index bucket grows along with the database;diminishing the effectiveness of the index. Thus it is important to establish effective methodsbeyond simply indexing BLAST hot-spots; where k equals 3 with concomitant 8;000 indexbuckets. Results: We investigate an evolutionary criterion to directly retrieve an evolutionaryneighborhood of kmers. The method uses metric-space search and an overlapping k-merrepresentation of protein databases. We prove a lemma that enables the comparison of twok-mers using weighted-Hamming distance in-lieu of global alignment; yielding an O (k)speed-up.

Incremental Structural Clustering for Dynamic Networks,Yazhong Chen; Rong-Hua Li; Qiangqiang Dai; Zhenjun Li; Shaojie Qiao; Rui Mao,Abstract Graph clustering is a fundamental tool for revealing cohesive structures in networks.The structural clustering algorithm for networks (SCAN) is an important approach for thistask; which has attracted much attention in recent years. The SCAN algorithm can not onlyuse to identify cohesive structures; but it is also able to detect outliers and hubs in a staticnetwork. Most real-life networks; however; frequently evolve over time. Unfortunately; theSCAN algorithm is very costly to handle such dynamic networks. In this paper; we proposean efficient incremental structural clustering algorithm for dynamic networks; called ISCAN.The ISCAN algorithm can efficiently maintain the clustering structures without recomputingthe clusters from scratch. We conduct extensive experiments in eight large real-worldnetworks. The results show that our algorithm is at least three orders of magnitude faster …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2017,*

Even the problems of computing most dense subgraphs (eg; clique; quasi-clique; k-densest subgraph) are NP-hard; there exists polynomial time algorithms for computing k-core and k-truss. In this paper; we propose a novel dense subgraph; k-core-truss; thatleverages on a new type of important edges based on the concepts of k-core and k-truss.Compared with k-core and k-truss; k-core-truss can significantly discover the interesting andimportant structural information outside the scope of the k-core and k-truss. We study twouseful problems of k-core-truss decomposition and k-core-truss search.

P-Alloc: Process-Variation Tolerant Reliability Management for 3D Charge-Trapping Flash Memory,Yi Wang; Lisha Dong; Rui Mao,Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) flash memory is an emerging memory technology thatenables a number of improvements to conventional planar NAND flash memory; includinglarger capacity; less program disturbance; and lower access latency. In contrast toconventional planar flash memory; 3D flash memory adopts charge-trapping mechanism.NAND strings punch through multiple stacked layers to form the three-dimensionalinfrastructure. However; the etching processes for NAND strings are unable to produceperfectly vertical features; especially on the scale of 20 nanometers or less. The processvariation will cause uneven distribution of electrons; which poses a threat to the integrity ofdata stored in flash.

Stealth-ACK: stealth transmissions of NoC acknowledgements,Jinhua Tao; Shi Qiu; Shaoli Liu; Tianshi Chen; Rui Mao,Abstract Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a promising replacement of bus architecture due to itsbetter scalability. In state-of-the-art NoCs; each packet contains several fixed-length flits;which facilitates allocations of network resources but brings in many unused bits. In thispaper; we propose a novel technique called Stealth-ACK to effectively address the aboveproblem. Stealth-ACK leverages unused bits in head flits of non-ACK packets to carry andstealthily transmit ACK information. Such stealth transmissions of ACK information effectivelyreduce not only the amount of dedicated ACK packets on NoC; but also the number ofunused bits in head flits of non-ACK packets; which significantly reduces wastes on NoCbandwidth. Experimental results show that Stealth-ACK averagely increases the throughputof 16× 16 2-D mesh NoC by 11.9%; and averagely reduces the NoC latency by 34.8% on …,Science China Information Sciences,2017,*
SLC25A36 and ZFAND5 Expression Levels Altered by the Interaction of EtOH Dosage and Exposure Time in Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells,Zhirui Wang; Jianqiang Li; Weiliang Qiu; Ji-Jiang Yang; Rui Mao; Shi Chen,Moderate alcohol consumption has health benefits of adults; while excessive alcohol haspoisonous effects on numerous different organs. However; the underlying molecularmechanisms of this phenomenon are still largely unclear yet. Human dental pulp stem cells(hDPSCs) have been used as models to investigate the effect of alcohol (EtOH) on geneexpression. It has been demonstrated that both EtOH dosage and exposure time affectsgene expression. However; the investigation into whether there exists synergistic effect ofEtOH dosage and exposure time on gene expression is rare. In the present study; wereported that the effect of interaction between EtOH dosage and exposure time issignificantly associated with the expression of genes SLC25A36 and ZFAND5 based on anhDPSC experiment.

Any destination node ofa k-fold multicast network can be involved in up to k simultaneous multicast connection. Thehardware cost of traditional k-fold switching network for wide-sense nonblocking multicast istypically very high. In this paper; we propose a new wide-sense nonblocking k-fold multicastnetwork and multicast routing algorithm. The k-fold design has significantly lower networkcost than that of k copies of 1-fold multicast networks. The time complexity of thecorresponding routing algorithm is no higher than that of previous works.,International Symposium on Parallel Architecture; Algorithm and Programming,2017,*
Semianalytical Solution for the Deformation of an Elastic Layer under an Axisymmetrically Distributed Power-Form Load: Application to Fluid-Jet-Induced Indentation...,Minhua Lu; Shuai Huang; Xianglong Yang; Lei Yang; Rui Mao,Fluid-jet-based indentation is used as a noncontact excitation technique by systemsmeasuring the mechanical properties of soft tissues. However; the application of thesedevices has been hindered by the lack of theoretical solutions. This study developed amathematical model for testing the indentation induced by a fluid jet and determined asemianalytical solution. The soft tissue was modeled as an elastic layer bonded to a rigidbase. The pressure of the fluid jet impinging on the soft tissue was assumed to have a power-form function. The semianalytical solution was verified in detail using finite-elementmodeling; with excellent agreement being achieved. The effects of several parameters onthe solution behaviors are reported; and a method for applying the solution to determine themechanical properties of soft tissues is suggested.,BioMed research international,2017,*

Closest neighbors excluded outlier detection,Honglong Xu; Rui Mao; Hao Liao; Minhua Lu; He Zhang,Traditional distance-based outlier detection usually consider the distances from a point to itsnearest neighbors as its outlier degree. In this case; if a few points form a small but densecluster; which is far from other points; points in this small and dense cluster are not likely tobe detected as outliers. In this paper; we propose a new distance-based outlier definition;Closest Neighbors Excluded (CNE) outlier; and the corresponding detection algorithm;which is able to detect dense outliers; as well as sparse outliers. Experimental results showthat the CNE algorithm achieves great improvement in accuracy with little cost of efficiency.,Online Analysis and Computing Science (ICOACS); IEEE International Conference of,2016,*

Index Based Hidden Outlier Detection in Metric Space,Honglong Xu; Rui Mao; Hao Liao; He Zhang; Minhua Lu; Guoliang Chen,Abstract Useless and noise information occupies large amount of big data; which increasesour difficulty to extract worthy information. Therefore outlier detection attracts much attentionrecently; but if two points are far from other points but are relatively close to each other; theyare less likely to be detected as outliers because of their adjacency to each other. In thissituation; outliers are hidden by each other. In this paper; we propose a new perspective ofhidden outlier. Experimental results show that it is more accurate than existing distance-based definitions of outliers. Accordingly; we exploit a candidate set based hidden outlierdetection HOD algorithm. HOD algorithm achieves higher accuracy with comparablerunning time. Further; we develop an index based HOD iHOD algorithm to get higherdetection speed.,Scientific Programming,2016,*

An Inclusion Rule for Vantage Point Tree Range Query Processing,Guohang Zeng; Qiaozhi Li; Huiming Jia; Xingliang Li; Yadi Cai; Rui Mao,Abstract Similarity search is a common computational task in many applications. Distance-based indexing techniques are proposed to enhance performance for similarity search inmetric space. In this paper; we propose an enhanced search algorithm for Vantage PointTree with an inclusion rule based on an upper bound on distances between the query itemand objects in database. In a range search task; objects which satisfy the inclusion rule alsosatisfy the range query; which means we can return them as results without distancecalculations. We obtain experimental results showing that our enhanced algorithmoutperforms the algorithm without inclusion rule significantly when the query radius is large.,International Conference on Human Centered Computing,2014,*

Speed up distance-based similarity query using multiple threads,Fuli Lei; Wenbo Wu; Qiaozhi Li; He Zhang; Ping Li; Qiuming Luo; Rui Mao,Metric-space indexing; also known as distance-based indexing; is a universal indexing tosupport similarity queries. It only requires that the similarity of data be defined by a metricdistance function. To achieve the great universalness; metric-space indexing does not takeuse of the domain information of data; and is thus outperformed by many domain-specificmethods. In this paper; to speed up metric-space similarity query; we first assign one threadfor each query in the multi-query case to increase the throughput. Then; for a single query;we assign one thread for each search path from the root of the index tree to decrease theresponding time. Last but not least; we implement an in-memory buffer to break thebottleneck of the disk access to the index file. Experimental results show that our effortsresult in good speed up and parallel efficiency.,Parallel Architectures; Algorithms and Programming (PAAP); 2014 Sixth International Symposium on,2014,*
Excluded Middle Forest Versus Vantage Point Tree: An Analytical and Empirical Comparison,Qiaozhi Li; He Zhang; Fuli Lei; Gang Liu; Minhua Lu; Rui Mao,Abstract A critical performance issue in searching distance-based indexing trees is thatcommonly multiple nodes; or data partitions; have to be further examined at each level of thetree. As a result; logarithmic search time is commonly not achievable. To solve this problem;excluded middle forest builds a tree for each data partition to be descended; so thatlogarithmic search time is achieved for each tree. Promising empirical results are reportedfrom excluded middle forest. However; we observe that what determines whether a datapartition has to be further examined is that data composing it; but not its location. Althougheach tree of the excluded middle forest can be searched in logarithmic time; the overallquery performance is encumbered with the existence of multiple trees. We show analyticallyand empirically that multiple vantage point tree outperforms excluded middle forest.,*,2014,*
A Least Random Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm,Honglong Xu; Gang Liu; Minhua Lu; Rui Mao,Abstract In the classic implementation of shuffled frog-leaping algorithm; in order to computethe evolution of frog groups (each of size n); the most common way is to first select q (q≤ n)frogs with unequal probability from each group based on frogs' individual fitness; and then;choosing the frog with the smallest fitness from selected ones and evolve it. However; theimplementation has to generate random number many times and thus lead to remarkabletime consumption. To solve this problem; in this paper; we first compute the probability ofevery frog to be chosen as the one with the lowest fitness and then choose the final frog withroulette algorithm. No random number is generated in the first step; and only one isgenerated in the second step. Empirical results show that the proposed method outperformsthe classic one in time consumption in most common cases. The speedup is 3.2 (q= 0.5 n …,*,2014,*
An On-demand Serialization Mechanism for Trees,Qiaozhi Li; He Zhang; Fuli Lei; Gang Liu; Minhua Lu; Rui Mao,Abstract In the Big Data era; complex data structures are usually too big to reside in mainmemory. Traditional serialization mechanism can only read a tree from the disk or write atree to the disk as a whole. When the tree gets huge; memory consumption to hold the wholetree becomes the bottleneck. To solve this problem; one need to be able to read or write onlypart of the tree only when necessary. We propose an on-demand serialization mechanismthat can read or write tree nodes one at a time while keep the logical structure intact.

Lacking of coordinate system in metric spaces; mathematical tools for Rnhad been prevented from being applied to metric spaces. The pivot space model embeds ametric space into a high dimensional space while preserving all the pair-wise distances. Asa result; pivot selection turns into a special form of dimension reduction which only selectsexisting dimensions. Given a set of predictors and a response variable; multivariateregression finds a subset of predictors to predict the response variable.

An Inverted Index Method for Mass Spectra K-Nearest Neighbor Queries,Houjun Tang; Xi Liu; Honglong Xu; Kezhong Lu; Gang Liu; Yuhong Feng; Hong Zhou; Rui Mao,Abstract. Finding k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) in metric-space is frequently used in modernbiological applications due to its general applicability. Processing such queries with generalpurpose methods usually requires more time and space than domain-specific methods. Thispaper presents an inverted index method which exploits the sparsity of mass spectra binaryformat data and compares it with an existing metric-space method. This metric-spacemethod acts as a coarse filter and can be followed by any fine ranking scheme.

One of the important properties of a metric space is the intrinsic dimension; whichrelies solely on the given space. The intrinsic dimension is a key factor in metric spaceindexing for nearest-neighbor search and range search. Therefore; there has been severalstudies of how to estimate it accurately and effectively. In this paper; we propose a simpleand effective method to estimate the intrinsic dimension of a metric space; using theeigenvalues of the pair-wise distance matrix of the metric space. Three criteria are comparedto find the best one that can most accurately determine the intrinsic dimension. Empiricalresults and comparison with other method show that this method can be used to reliablymeasure the intrinsic dimension of a metric space.,Lecture Notes in Information Technology Volume 10,*,*
