The performance of mapreduce: An in-depth study,Dawei Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Lei Shi; Sai Wu,Abstract MapReduce has been widely used for large-scale data analysis in the Cloud. Thesystem is well recognized for its elastic scalability and fine-grained fault tolerance althoughits performance has been noted to be suboptimal in the database context. According to arecent study [19]; Hadoop; an open source implementation of MapReduce; is slower thantwo state-of-the-art parallel database systems in performing a variety of analytical tasks by afactor of 3.1 to 6.5. MapReduce can achieve better performance with the allocation of morecompute nodes from the cloud to speed up computation; however; this approach of" rentingmore nodes" is not cost effective in a pay-as-you-go environment. Users desire aneconomical elastically scalable data processing system; and therefore; are interested inwhether MapReduce can offer both elastic scalability and efficiency.

Indexing multi-dimensional data in a cloud system,Jinbao Wang; Sai Wu; Hong Gao; Jianzhong Li; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Providing scalable database services is an essential requirement for extendingmany existing applications of the Cloud platform. Due to the diversity of applications;database services on the Cloud must support large-scale data analytical jobs and highconcurrent OLTP queries. Most existing work focuses on some specific type of applications.To provide an integrated framework; we are designing a new system; epiC; as our solutionto next-generation database systems. In epiC; indexes play an important role in improvingoverall performance. Different types of indexes are built to provide efficient query processingfor different applications. In this paper; we propose RT-CAN; a multi-dimensional indexingscheme in epiC. RT-CAN integrates CAN [23] based routing protocol and the R-tree basedindexing scheme to support efficient multi-dimensional query processing in a Cloud …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,196
Cdas: a crowdsourcing data analytics system,Xuan Liu; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Yanyan Shen; Sai Wu; Meihui Zhang,Abstract Some complex problems; such as image tagging and natural language processing;are very challenging for computers; where even state-of-the-art technology is yet able toprovide satisfactory accuracy. Therefore; rather than relying solely on developing new andbetter algorithms to handle such tasks; we look to the crowdsourcing solution--employinghuman participation--to make good the shortfall in current technology. Crowdsourcing is agood supplement to many computer tasks. A complex job may be divided into computer-oriented tasks and human-oriented tasks; which are then assigned to machines and humansrespectively. To leverage the power of crowdsourcing; we design and implement aCrowdsourcing Data Analytics System; CDAS. CDAS is a framework designed to support thedeployment of various crowdsourcing applications. The core part of CDAS is a quality …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,167
Distributed data management using MapReduce,Feng Li; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Özsu; Sai Wu,Abstract MapReduce is a framework for processing and managing large-scale datasets in adistributed cluster; which has been used for applications such as generating search indexes;document clustering; access log analysis; and various other forms of data analytics.MapReduce adopts a flexible computation model with a simple interface consisting of mapand reduce functions whose implementations can be customized by application developers.Since its introduction; a substantial amount of research effort has been directed towardmaking it more usable and efficient for supporting database-centric operations. In this article;we aim to provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of proposals and systems thatfocusing fundamentally on the support of distributed data management and processingusing the MapReduce framework.,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),2014,162
Query optimization for massively parallel data processing,Sai Wu; Feng Li; Sharad Mehrotra; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract MapReduce has been widely recognized as an efficient tool for large-scale dataanalysis. It achieves high performance by exploiting parallelism among processing nodeswhile providing a simple interface for upper-layer applications. Some vendors haveenhanced their data warehouse systems by integrating MapReduce into the systems.However; existing MapReduce-based query processing systems; such as Hive; fall short ofthe query optimization and competency of conventional database systems. Given an SQLquery; Hive translates the query into a set of MapReduce jobs sentence by sentence. Thisdesign assumes that the user can optimize his query before submitting it to the system.Unfortunately; manual query optimization is time consuming and difficult; even to anexperienced database user or administrator. In this paper; we propose a query …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2011,154
Llama: leveraging columnar storage for scalable join processing in the MapReduce framework,Yuting Lin; Divyakant Agrawal; Chun Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract To achieve high reliability and scalability; most large-scale data warehousesystems have adopted the cluster-based architecture. In this paper; we propose the designof a new cluster-based data warehouse system; LLama; a hybrid data management systemwhich combines the features of row-wise and column-wise database systems. In Llama;columns are formed into correlation groups to provide the basis for the vertical partitioning oftables. Llama employs a distributed file system (DFS) to disseminate data among clusternodes. Above the DFS; a MapReduce-based query engine is supported. We design a newjoin algorithm to facilitate fast join processing. We present a performance study on TPC-Hdataset and compare Llama with Hive; a data warehouse infrastructure built on top ofHadoop. The experiment is conducted on EC2. The results show that Llama has an …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,137
Efficient B-tree based indexing for cloud data processing,Sai Wu; Dawei Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Kun-Lung Wu,Abstract A Cloud may be seen as a type of flexible computing infrastructure consisting ofmany compute nodes; where resizable computing capacities can be provided to differentcustomers. To fully harness the power of the Cloud; efficient data management is needed tohandle huge volumes of data and support a large number of concurrent end users. Toachieve that; a scalable and high-throughput indexing scheme is generally required. Suchan indexing scheme must not only incur a low maintenance cost but also support parallelsearch to improve scalability. In this paper; we present a novel; scalable B+-tree basedindexing scheme for efficient data processing in the Cloud. Our approach can besummarized as follows. First; we build a local B+-tree index for each compute node whichonly indexes data residing on the node. Second; we organize the compute nodes as a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,136
Ti: an efficient indexing mechanism for real-time search on tweets,Chun Chen; Feng Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract Real-time search dictates that new contents be made available for searchimmediately following their creation. From the database perspective; this requirement maybe quite easily met by creating an up-to-date index for the contents and measuring searchquality by the time gap between insertion time and availability of the index. This approach;however; poses new challenges for micro-blogging systems where thousands of concurrentusers may upload their micro-blogs or tweets simultaneously. Due to the high update andquery loads; conventional approaches would either fail to index the huge amount of newlycreated contents in real time or fall short of providing a scalable indexing service. In thispaper; we propose a tweet index called the TI (Tweet Index); an adaptive indexing schemefor microblogging systems such as Twitter. The intuition of the TI is to index the tweets that …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,124
Es 2: A cloud data storage system for supporting both oltp and olap,Yu Cao; Chun Chen; Fei Guo; Dawei Jiang; Yuting Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu; Quanqing Xu,Cloud computing represents a paradigm shift driven by the increasing demand of Webbased applications for elastic; scalable and efficient system architectures that can efficientlysupport their ever-growing data volume and large-scale data analysis. A typical datamanagement system has to deal with real-time updates by individual users; and as well asperiodical large scale analytical processing; indexing; and data extraction. While suchoperations may take place in the same domain; the design and development of the systemshave somehow evolved independently for transactional and periodical analyticalprocessing. Such a system-level separation has resulted in problems such as datafreshness as well as serious data storage redundancy. Ideally; it would be more efficient toapply ad-hoc analytical processing on the same data directly. However; to the best of our …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,97
Distributed online aggregations,Sai Wu; Shouxu Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In many decision making applications; users typically issue aggregate queries. Toevaluate these computationally expensive queries; online aggregation has been developedto provide approximate answers (with their respective confidence intervals) quickly; and tocontinuously refine the answers. In this paper; we extend the online aggregation techniqueto a distributed context where sites are maintained in a DHT (Distributed Hash Table)network. Our Distributed Online Aggregation (DoA) scheme iteratively and progressivelyproduces approximate aggregate answers as follows: in each iteration; a small set ofrandom samples are retrieved from the data sites and distributed to the processing sites; ateach processing site; a local aggregate is computed based on the allocated samples; at acoordinator site; these local aggregates are combined into a global aggregate.

An Indexing Framework for Efficient Retrieval on the Cloud.,Sai Wu; Kun-Lung Wu,Abstract The emergence of the Cloud system has simplified the deployment of large-scaledistributed systems for software vendors. The Cloud system provides a simple and unifiedinterface between vendor and user; allowing vendors to focus more on the software itselfrather than the underlying framework. Existing Cloud systems seek to improve performanceby increasing parallelism. In this paper; we explore an alternative solution; proposing anindexing framework for the Cloud system based on the structured overlay. Our indexingframework reduces the amount of data transferred inside the Cloud and facilitates thedeployment of database back-end applications.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2009,50
Continuous sampling for online aggregation over multiple queries,Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we propose an online aggregation system called COSMOS(Continuous Sampling for Multiple queries in an Online aggregation System); to processmultiple aggregate queries efficiently. In COSMOS; a dataset is first scrambled so thatsequentially scanning the dataset gives rise to a stream of random samples for all queries.Moreover; COSMOS organizes queries into a dissemination graph to exploit thedependencies across queries. In this way; aggregates of queries closer to the root (source ofdata flow) can potentially be used to compute the aggregates of descendent/dependentqueries. COSMOS applies some statistical approach to combine answers from ancestornodes to generate the online aggregates for a node. COSMOS also offers a partitioningstrategy to further salvage intermediate answers. We have implemented COSMOS and …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,49
A framework for supporting dbms-like indexes in the cloud,Gang Chen; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Özsu,ABSTRACT To support “Database as a service”(DaaS) in the cloud; the database system isexpected to provide similar functionalities as in centralized DBMS such as efficientprocessing of ad hoc queries. The system must therefore support DBMS-like indexes;possibly a few indexes for each table to provide fast location of data distributed over thenetwork. In such a distributed environment; the indexes have to be distributed over thenetwork to achieve scalability and reliability. Each cluster node maintains a subset of theindex data. As in conventional DBMS; indexes incur maintenance overhead and theproblem is more complex in the distributed environment since the data are typicallypartitioned and distributed based on a subset of attributes. Further; the distribution ofindexes is not straight forward; and there is therefore always the question of scalability; in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,48
Skyline-join in distributed databases,Dalie Sun; Sai Wu; Jianzhong Li; Anthony KH Tung,The database research community has recently recognized the usefulness of skyline query.As an extension of existing database operator; the skyline query is valuable for multi-criteriadecision making. However; current research tends to assume that the skyline operator isapplied to one table which is not true for many applications on web databases. In webdatabases; tables are distributed in different sites; and a skyline query may involve attributesof multiple tables. In this paper; we address the problem of processing skyline queries onmultiple tables in a distributed environment. We call the new operator skyline-join; as it is ahybrid of skyline and join operations. We propose two efficient approaches to processskyline-join queries which can significantly reduce the communication cost and processingtime. Experiments are conducted and results show that our approaches are efficient for …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,48
epiC: an extensible and scalable system for processing big data,Dawei Jiang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sai Wu,Abstract The Big Data problem is characterized by the so called 3V features: Volume-a hugeamount of data; Velocity-a high data ingestion rate; and Variety-a mix of structured data;semi-structured data; and unstructured data. The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Dataproblem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open sourceimplementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challengesuccessfully; it does not deal with the data variety well since the programming interfaces andits associated data processing model is inconvenient and inefficient for handling structureddata and graph data. This paper presents epiC; an extensible system to tackle the Big Data'sdata variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model;independent of the data processing models; for specifying parallel computations.

Just-in-time query retrieval over partially indexed data on structured p2p overlays,Sai Wu; Jianzhong Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays have been successfully employed in manyapplications to locate content. However; they have been less effective in handling massiveamounts of data because of the high overhead of maintaining indexes. In this paper; wepropose PISCES; a Peer-based system that Indexes Selected Content for Efficient Search.Unlike traditional approaches that index all data; PISCES identifies a subset of tuples toindex based on some criteria (such as query frequency; update frequency; index cost; etc.).In addition; a coarse-grained range index is built to facilitate the processing of queries thatcannot be fully answered by the tuple-level index. More importantly; PISCES can adaptivelyself-tune to optimize the subset of tuples to be indexed. That is; the (partial) index in PISCESis built in a Just-In-Time (JIT) manner.

Providing scalable database services on the cloud,Chun Chen; Gang Chen; Dawei Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu; Quanqing Xu,Abstract The Cloud is fast gaining popularity as a platform for deploying Software as aService (SaaS) applications. In principle; the Cloud provides unlimited compute resources;enabling deployed services to scale seamlessly. Moreover; the pay-as-you-go model in theCloud reduces the maintenance overhead of the applications. Given the advantages of theCloud; it is attractive to migrate existing software to this new platform. However; challengesremain as most software applications need to be redesigned to embrace the Cloud. In thispaper; we present an overview of our current on-going work in developing epiC–an elasticand efficient power-aware data-intensive Cloud system. We discuss the design issues andthe implementation of epiC's storage system and processing engine. The storage systemand the processing engine are loosely coupled; and have been designed to handle two …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2010,35
Real-time recommendation for microblogs,Xianke Zhou; Sai Wu; Chun Chen; Gang Chen; Shanshan Ying,Abstract Existing microblogging systems; such as Twitter; provide global or local discussiontrends; so that users can easily find hot topics to follow on. The discussion trends arediscovered by analyzing statistics of the microblogging database globally or regionally. As aconsequence; users who select the same region; receive the same set of topics irrespectiveof their interests. This strategy fails to deliver relevant recommendations to the right users. Toaddress this problem; in this paper; we propose a real-time customized recommendationscheme for microblogging systems. Our approach identifies users' interests via theirpersonal tags and builds tag-user graphs for computing the similarities between microblogsand users. The subsequently submitted microblogs are considered as an input stream thatflows through our tag-user graphs and buffered for the interested users. The user's …,Information Sciences,2014,30
ScalaGiST: scalable generalized search trees for mapreduce systems [innovative systems paper],Peng Lu; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu,Abstract MapReduce has become the state-of-the-art for data parallel processing.Nevertheless; Hadoop; an open-source equivalent of MapReduce; has been noted to havesub-optimal performance in the database context since it is initially designed to operate onraw data without utilizing any type of indexes. To alleviate the problem; we presentScalaGiST-scalable generalized search tree that can be seamlessly integrated with Hadoop;together with a cost-based data access optimizer for efficient query processing at run-time.ScalaGiST provides extensibility in terms of data and query types; hence is able to supportunconventional queries (eg; multi-dimensional range and k-NN queries) in MapReducesystems; and can be dynamically deployed in large cluster environments for handling bigusers and data. We have built ScalaGiST and demonstrated that it can be easily …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,27
Automatic itinerary planning for traveling services,Gang Chen; Sai Wu; Jingbo Zhou; Anthony KH Tung,Creating an efficient and economic trip plan is the most annoying job for a backpack traveler.Although travel agency can provide some predefined itineraries; they are not tailored foreach specific customer. Previous efforts address the problem by providing an automaticitinerary planning service; which organizes the points-of-interests (POIs) into a customizeditinerary. Because the search space of all possible itineraries is too costly to fully explore; tosimplify the complexity; most work assume that user's trip is limited to some important POIsand will complete within one day. To address the above limitation; in this paper; we design amore general itinerary planning service; which generates multiday itineraries for the users.In our service; all POIs are considered and ranked based on the users' preference. Theproblem of searching the optimal itinerary is a team orienteering problem (TOP); a well …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,26
An efficient and compact indexing scheme for large-scale data store,Peng Lu; Sai Wu; Lidan Shou; Kian-Lee Tan,The amount of data managed in today's Cloud systems has reached an unprecedentedscale. In order to speed up query processing; an effective mechanism is to build indexes onattributes that are used in query predicates. However; conventional indexing schemes fail toprovide a scalable service: as the size of these indexes are proportional to the data size; it isnot space efficient to build many indexes. As such; it becomes more crucial to developeffective index to provide scalable database services in the Cloud. In this paper; we proposea compact bitmap indexing scheme for a large-scale data store. The bitmap indexingscheme combines state-of-the-art bitmap compression techniques; such as WAH encodingand bit-sliced encoding. To further reduce the index cost; a novel and query efficient partialindexing technique is adopted; which dynamically refreshes the index to handle updates …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,24

Parallelizing stateful operators in a distributed stream processing system: how; should you and how much?,Sai Wu; Vibhore Kumar; Kun-Lung Wu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract We consider a distributed stream processing application; expressed as a data-flowgraph with operators as vertices connected by streams and deployed over a cluster ofcompute nodes; where a small subset of the operators are often the performancebottlenecks for the entire application. In cases where a bottleneck operator is stateless; it isobvious that parallelization by splitting the incoming stream among multiple paralleloperators deployed on different nodes can help improve performance. However; it is not soobvious when the bottleneck operator is stateful. In such a case; parallelization is muchmore challenging as it often requires a state sharing mechanism for the parallel operators.Moreover; it incurs additional overheads of required accesses by the parallel operators toshared state and synchronization constructs. In this paper; we propose a parallelization …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2012,23
K-anonymity for crowdsourcing database,Sai Wu; Xiaoli Wang; Sheng Wang; Zhenjie Zhang; Anthony KH Tung,In crowdsourcing database; human operators are embedded into the database engine andcollaborate with other conventional database operators to process the queries. Each humanoperator publishes small HITs (Human Intelligent Task) to the crowdsourcing platform; whichconsists of a set of database records and corresponding questions for human workers. Thehuman workers complete the HITs and return the results to the crowdsourcing database forfurther processing. In practice; published records in HITs may contain sensitive attributes;probably causing privacy leakage so that malicious workers could link them with other publicdatabases to reveal individual private information. Conventional privacy protectiontechniques; such as K-Anonymity; can be applied to partially solve the problem. However;after generalizing the data; the result of standard K-Anonymity algorithms may render …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,21
Adaptive logging: Optimizing logging and recovery costs in distributed in-memory databases,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract By maintaining the data in main memory; in-memory databases dramatically reducethe I/O cost of transaction processing. However; for recovery purposes; in-memory systemsstill need to flush the log to disk; which incurs a substantial number of I/Os. Recently;command logging has been proposed to replace the traditional data log (eg; ARIES logging)in in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuples are updated; command loggingonly tracks the transactions that are being executed; thereby effectively reducing the size ofthe log and improving the performance. However; when a failure occurs; all the transactionsin the log after the last checkpoint must be redone sequentially and this significantlyincreases the cost of recovery. In this paper; we first extend the command logging techniqueto a distributed system; where all the nodes can perform their recovery in parallel.

Evaluating large graph processing in MapReduce based on message passing,Wei Pan; Z-H Li; Sai Wu; Qun Chen,Since analyzing large-scale graph is usually difficult to be implemented on a singlemachine; how to design efficient parallel large-scale graph algorithms is receiving more andmore attention. Constrained by embarrassingly parallel assumption; parallel graphalgorithms are not easy to express in MapReduce. Inspired by Bulk Synchronous Parallelmodel; we propose a message-enhanced version of Hadoop MapReduce that breaks its keyassumption. Enhanced implementation is compatible with original Hadoop MapReduce;existing Hadoop MapReduce programs can run directly on this platform without modification;and uses message passing mechanisms to facilitate interactive data communicationbetween supersteps of tasks. It also provides a highly flexible self-defined message passinginterface and two adaptive message passing mechanisms to support efficient …,*,2011,17
E3: an elastic execution engine for scalable data processing,Gang Chen; Ke Chen; Dawei Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Lei Shi; Hoang Tam Vo; Sai Wu,抄録 With the unprecedented growth of data generated by mankind nowadays; it hasbecome critical to develop efficient techniques for processing these massive data sets. Totackle such challenges; analytical data processing systems must be extremely efficient;scalable; and flexible as well as economically effective. Recently; Hadoop; an open-sourceimplementation of MapReduce; has gained interests as a promising big data processingsystem. Although Hadoop offers the desired flexibility and scalability; its performance hasbeen noted to be suboptimal when it is used to process complex analytical tasks.

Personal recommendation using deep recurrent neural networks in NetEase,Sai Wu; Weichao Ren; Chengchao Yu; Gang Chen; Dongxiang Zhang; Jingbo Zhu,Each user session in an e-commerce system can be modeled as a sequence of web pages;indicating how the user interacts with the system and makes his/her purchase. A typicalrecommendation approach; eg; Collaborative Filtering; generates its results at the beginningof each session; listing the most likely purchased items. However; such approach fails toexploit current viewing history of the user and hence; is unable to provide a real-timecustomized recommendation service. In this paper; we build a deep recurrent neuralnetwork to address the problem. The network tracks how users browse the website usingmultiple hidden layers. Each hidden layer models how the combinations of webpages areaccessed and in what order. To reduce the processing cost; the network only records a finitenumber of states; while the old states collapse into a single history state.

Cross domain search by exploiting wikipedia,Chen Liu; Sai Wu; Shouxu Jiang; Anthony KH Tung,The abundance of Web 2.0 resources in various media formats calls for better resourceintegration to enrich user experience. This naturally leads to a new cross-modal resourcesearch requirement; in which a query is a resource in one modal and the results are closelyrelated resources in other modalities. With cross-modal search; we can better exploitexisting resources. Tags associated with Web 2.0 resources are intuitive medium to linkresources with different modality together. However; tagging is by nature an ad hoc activity.They often contain noises and are affected by the subjective inclination of the tagger.Consequently; linking resources simply by tags will not be reliable. In this paper; we proposean approach for linking tagged resources to concepts extracted from Wikipedia; which hasbecome a fairly reliable reference over the last few years. Compared to the tags; the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,12
Adaptive multi-join query processing in pdbms,Sai Wu; Quang Hieu Vu; Jianzhong Li; Kian-Lee Tan,Traditionally; distributed databases assume that the small) set of nodes participating in aquery is known apriori; the data is well placed; and the statistics are readily available.However; these assumptions are no longer valid in a Peer-based DataBase ManagementSystem (PDBMS). As such; it is a challenge to process and optimize queries in a PDBMS. Inthis paper; we present our distributed solution to this problem for multi-way join queries. Ourapproach first processes a multi-way join query based on an initial query evaluation plan(generated using statistical data that may be obsolete or inaccurate); as the query isbeingprocessed; statistics obtained on-the-fly are used to (continuously) refine the currentplan dynamically into a more effective one.

kNN processing with co-space distance in SoLoMo systems,Xianke Zhou; Sai Wu; Gang Chen; Lidan Shou,Abstract With the increasing popularity of smart phones; SoLoMo (Social-Location-Mobile)systems are expected to be fast-growing and become a popular mobile social networkingplatform. A main challenge in such systems is on the creation of stable links between users.For each online user; the current SoLoMo system continuously returns his/her kNN (kNearest Neighbor) users based on their geo-locations. Such a recommendation approach issimple; but fails to create sustainable friendships. Instead; it would be more effective to taponto the existing social relationships in conventional social networks; such as Facebook andTwitter; to provide a “better” friend recommendations. To measure the similarity betweenusers; we propose a new metric; co-space distance; by considering both the user distancesin the real world (physical distance) and the virtual world (social distance).

Online aggregation,Sai Wu; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this chapter; we introduce a new promising technique for query processing;online aggregation. Online aggregation is proposed based on the assumption that for someapplications; the precise results are not always required. Instead; the approximate resultscan provide a good enough estimation. Compared to the precise results; computing theapproximate ones are more cost effective; especially for large-scale datasets. To generatethe approximate result; online aggregation retrieves samples continuously from thedatabase. The samples are streamed to the query engine for processing the query. Theaccuracy of the approximate result is described by a statistical model. Normally; the result isrefined as more samples are obtained. The user can terminate the processing at any time;when he/she is satisfied with the quality of the result. The performance of online …,*,2013,9
Simpson: Efficient similarity search in metric spaces over P2P structured overlay networks,Quang Hieu Vu; Mihai Lupu; Sai Wu,Abstract Similarity search in metric spaces over centralized systems has been significantlystudied in the database research community. However; not so much work has been done inthe context of P2P networks. This paper introduces SiMPSON: a P2P system supportingsimilarity search in metric spaces. The aim is to answer queries faster and using lessresources than existing systems. For this; each peer first clusters its own data using any off-the-shelf clustering algorithms. Then; the resulting clusters are mapped to one-dimensionalvalues. Finally; these one-dimensional values are indexed into a structured P2P overlay.Our method slightly increases the indexing overhead; but allows us to greatly reduce thenumber of peers and messages involved in query processing: we trade a small amount ofoverhead in the data publishing process for a substantial reduction of costs in the …,European Conference on Parallel Processing,2009,9
The knowing camera: recognizing places-of-interest in smartphone photos,Pai Peng; Lidan Shou; Ke Chen; Gang Chen; Sai Wu,Abstract This paper presents a framework called Knowing Camera for real-time recognizingplaces-of-interest in smartphone photos; with the availability of online geotagged images ofsuch places. We propose a probabilistic field-of-view model which captures the uncertaintyin camera sensor data. This model can be used to retrieve a set of candidate images. Thevisual similarity computation of the candidate images relies on the sparse coding technique.We also propose an ANN filtering technique to speedup the sparse coding. The final rankingcombines an uncertain geometric relevance with the visual similarity. Our preliminaryexperiments conducted in an urban area of a large city show promising results. The mostdistinguishing feature of our framework is its ability to perform well in contaminated; real-world online image database.

Lazylsh: Approximate nearest neighbor search for multiple distance functions with a single index,Yuxin Zheng; Qi Guo; Anthony KH Tung; Sai Wu,Abstract Due to the" curse of dimensionality" problem; it is very expensive to process thenearest neighbor (NN) query in high-dimensional spaces; and hence; approximateapproaches; such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH); are widely used for their theoreticalguarantees and empirical performance. Current LSH-based approaches target at the L1 andL2 spaces; while as shown in previous work; the fractional distance metrics (Lp metrics with0< p< 1) can provide more insightful results than the usual L1 and L2 metrics for data miningand multimedia applications. However; none of the existing work can support multiplefractional distance metrics using one index. In this paper; we propose LazyLSH that answersapproximate nearest neighbor queries for multiple Lp metrics with theoretical guarantees.Different from previous LSH approaches which need to build one dedicated index for …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,6
Approximate aggregations in structured P2P networks,Dalie Sun; Sai Wu; Shouxu Jiang; Jianzhong Li,In corporate networks; daily business data are generated in gigabytes or even terabytes. It iscostly to process aggregate queries in those systems. In this paper; we propose PACA; aprobably approximately correct aggregate query processing scheme; for answeringaggregate queries in structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. PACA retrieves randomsamples from peers' databases and applies the samples to process queries. Instead ofscanning the entire database of each peer; PACA only accesses a small random number ofdata. Moreover; based on the query distribution; PACA publishes a precomputed synopsisand uses the synopsis to answer future queries. Most queries are expected to be answeredby the precomputed synopsis partially or fully. And the synopsis is adaptively tuned to followthe query distribution.

Adaptive logging for distributed in-memory databases,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract: A new type of logs; the command log; is being employed to replace the traditionaldata log (eg; ARIES log) in the in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuplesare updated; a command log only tracks the transactions being executed; thereby effectivelyreducing the size of the log and improving the performance. Command logging on the otherhand increases the cost of recovery; because all the transactions in the log after the lastcheckpoint must be completely redone in case of a failure. In this paper; we first extend thecommand logging technique to a distributed environment; where all the nodes can performrecovery in parallel. We then propose an adaptive logging approach by combining datalogging and command logging. The percentage of data logging versus command loggingbecomes an optimization between the performance of transaction processing and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.03653,2015,5
epiC: an extensible and scalable system for processing Big Data,Dawei Jiang; Sai Wu; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Jun Xu,Abstract The Big Data problem is characterized by the so-called 3V features: volume—ahuge amount of data; velocity—a high data ingestion rate; and variety—a mix of structureddata; semi-structured data; and unstructured data. The state-of-the-art solutions to the BigData problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open sourceimplementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challengesuccessfully; it does not deal with the data variety well since the programming interfaces andits associated data processing model are inconvenient and inefficient for handling structureddata and graph data. This paper presents epiC; an extensible system to tackle the Big Data'sdata variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model;independent of the data processing models; for specifying parallel computations.

The mining result can be utilized to annotate theregion-of-interest on the query image during the online query processing. Besides; thismining procedure further improves the efficiency and accuracy of the S+ V framework.

Hm: a column-oriented mapreduce system on hybrid storage,Sai Wu; Gang Chen; Ke Chen; Feng Li; Lidan Shou,The solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD) incorporates a small NAND flash memory into a harddrive; resulting in an integrated device with combined Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and SolidState Disk (SSD) storage. By identifying the data highly associated with the performance andbuffering them in the SSD part; SSHD can deliver a better performance than the standardhard drive. However; that requires a significant redesign for existing data processingsystems. In this paper; we examine the problem of efficiently processing relational datausing MapReduce on a cluster using SSHDs as the underlying storage devices. We presentthe design of Hybrid MapReduce (HM); a column-oriented MapReduce system; whichadopts different storage layout; query optimizer; data index; and compression algorithm fromprevious MapReduce systems.

Targeted advertising in public transportation systems with quantitative evaluation,Dongxiang Zhang; Long Guo; Liqiang Nie; Jie Shao; Sai Wu; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract In spite of vast business potential; targeted advertising in public transportationsystems is a grossly unexplored research area. For instance; SBS Transit in Singapore canreach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than&dollar; 35 million. To bridge the gap; we propose a probabilistic data model that capturesthe motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of anadvertisement among the passengers. In particular; we leverage hundreds of millions ofbus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as theextent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model; we study a top-kretrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation; which acts as a primitive operator tosupport various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2017,2
Progressive online aggregation in a distributed stream system,Dingyu Yang; Jian Cao; Sai Wu; Jie Wang,Abstract Interactive query processing aims at generating approximate results with minimumresponse time. However; it is quite difficult for a batch-oriented processing system toprogressively provide cumulatively accurate results in the context of a distributedenvironment. MapReduce Online extends the MapReduce framework to support onlineaggregation; but it is hindered by its processing speed in keeping up with ongoing real-timedata events. We deploy the online aggregation algorithm over S4; a scalable streamprocessing system that is inspired by the combined functionalities of MapReduce and Actormodel. Our system applies an asynchronous message communication mechanism fromactor model to support online aggregation. It can process large scale data stream with highconcurrency in a short response time. In this system; we adopt a distributed weighted …,Journal of Systems and Software,2015,2

Crowd-answering system via microblogging,Xianke Zhou; Ke Chen; Sai Wu; Bingbing Zhang,Most crowdsourcing systems leverage the public platforms; such as Amazon MechanicalTurk (AMT); to publish their jobs and collect the results. They are charged for using theplatform's service and they are also required to pay the workers for each successful job.Although the average wage of the online human worker is not high; for a 24× 7 runningservice; the crowdsourcing system becomes very expensive to maintain. We observe thatthere are; in fact; many sources that can provide free online human volunteers.Microblogging system is one of the most promising human resources.

A New Approach to Compute CNNs for Extremely Large Images,Sai Wu; Mengdan Zhang; Gang Chen; Ke Chen,Abstract CNN (Convolution Neural Network) is widely used in visual analysis and achievesexceptionally high performances in image classification; face detection; object recognition;image recoloring; and other learning jobs. Using deep learning frameworks; such as Torchand Tensorflow; CNN can be efficiently computed by leveraging the power of GPU.However; one drawback of GPU is its limited memory which prohibits us from handling largeimages. Passing a 4K resolution image to the VGG network will result in an exception of out-of-memory for Titan-X GPU. In this paper; we propose a new approach that adopts the BSP(bulk synchronization parallel) model to compute CNNs for images of any size. Before fed toa specific CNN layer; the image is split into smaller pieces which go through the neuralnetwork separately. Then; a specific padding and normalization technique is adopted to …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
CSIR4G: An effective and efficient cross-scenario image retrieval model for glasses,Xiaoling Gu; Sai Wu; Pai Peng; Lidan Shou; Ke Chen; Gang Chen,Abstract In this work; we propose an effective and efficient cross-scenario glasses retrievalmodel with the goal of providing a new online shopping experience. Two challenging issuesarise for cross-scenario glasses retrieval: identifying glasses in a query image and extractingfeatures from the identified glasses. To properly address these issues; we introduce a novelsegmentation-free framework which includes a glasses detection model; an attributerecognition model; and a coarse-to-fine search strategy. Specifically; a new keypoint-basedscheme called EyeGlasses keYPoinT (EGYPT) for glasses detection is proposed; in which aset of representative keypoints along a glasses frame are automatically identified. Based onthese detected keypoints; various local feature descriptors are extracted to learn thesemantic attributes of the glasses. Furthermore; fast retrieval is achieved by applying a …,Information Sciences,2017,*
FlashView: an interactive visual explorer for raw data,Zhifei Pang; Sai Wu; Gang Chen; Ke Chen; Lidan Shou,Abstract New data has been generated in an unexpected high speed. To get insight of thosedata; data analysts will perform a thorough study using state-of-the-art big data analyticaltools. Before the analysis starts; a preprocessing is conducted; where data analyst tends toissue a few ad-hoc queries on a new dataset to explore and gain a better understanding.However; it is costly to perform such ad-hoc queries on large scale data using traditionaldata management systems; eg; DBMS; because data loading and indexing are veryexpensive. In this demo; we propose a novel visual data explorer system; FlashView; whichomits the loading process by directly querying raw data. FlashView applies approximatequery processing technique to achieve real-time query results. It builds both in-memoryindex and disk index to facilitate the data scanning. It also supports tracking and updating …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*
Tuning the granularity of parallelism for distributed graph processing,Xinyuan Luo; Sai Wu; Wei Wang; Lidan Shou,Abstract Popular distributed graph processing frameworks; such as Pregel and GraphLab;are based on the vertex-centric computation model; where users write their customizedCompute function for each vertex to process the data iteratively. Vertices are evenlypartitioned among the compute nodes; and the granularity of parallelism of the graphalgorithm is normally tuned by adjusting the number of compute nodes. Vertex-centric modelsplits the computation into phases. Inside one specific phase; the computation proceeds asan embarrassingly parallel process; because no communication between compute nodesincurs. By default; current graph engine only handles one iteration of the algorithm in aphase. However; in this paper; we find that we can also tune the granularity of parallelism;by aggregating the computation of multiple iterations into one phase; which has a …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2017,*
iGlasses: A Novel Recommendation System for Best-fit Glasses,Xiaoling Gu; Lidan Shou; Pai Peng; Ke Chen; Sai Wu; Gang Chen,Abstract We demonstrate iGlasses; a novel recommendation system that accepts a frontalface photo as the input and returns the best-fit eyeglasses as the output. As conventionalrecommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering become inapplicable in theproblem; we propose a new recommendation method which exploits the implicit matchingrules between human faces and eyeglasses. We first define fine-grained attributes forhuman faces and frames of glasses respectively. Then; we develop a recommendationframework based on a probabilistic graphical model; which effectively captures thecorrelation among these fine-grained attributes. Ranking of the frames (glasses) is done bytheir similarity to the query facial attributes. Finally; we produce a synthesized image for theinput face to demonstrate the visual effect when wearing the recommended glasses.,Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2016,*

Supporting High Dimensional Range Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems,Sai Wu; Hong Gao; Bei Yu,Abstract. A large number of works have been proposed to improve the search efficiency inpeer-to-peer (P2P) systems. However; most of them focus on exact key match queries;whereas few schemes are proved efficient and practical for the range queries. Actually; highdimensional data and range queries need to be supported in lots of real applications; suchas database management systems (DBMS) and image retrieval systems. In this paper; wepresent a scalable scheme for efficiently performing high dimensional range queries in P2Psystems in terms of both dimensionality and network size. Our data space partition strategyalso forces load balancing among participating peers. We compare our schemes withprevious work. Experiments with various synthetic and real datasets show the effectivenessof the proposed scheme.,*,*,*
