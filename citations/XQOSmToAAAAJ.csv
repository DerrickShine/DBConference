Delegatable pseudorandom functions and applications,Aggelos Kiayias; Stavros Papadopoulos; Nikos Triandopoulos; Thomas Zacharias,Abstract We put forth the problem of delegating the evaluation of a pseudorandom function(PRF) to an untrusted proxy and introduce a novel cryptographic primitive called delegatablepseudorandom functions; or DPRFs for short: A DPRF enables a proxy to evaluate apseudorandom function on a strict subset of its domain using a trapdoor derived from theDPRF secret key. The trapdoor is constructed with respect to a certain policy predicate thatdetermines the subset of input values which the proxy is allowed to compute. The mainchallenge in constructing DPRFs is to achieve bandwidth efficiency (which mandates thatthe trapdoor is smaller than the precomputed sequence of the PRF values conforming to thepredicate); while maintaining the pseudorandomness of unknown values against an attackerthat adaptively controls the proxy. A DPRF may be optionally equipped with an additional …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,154
Nearest neighbor search with strong location privacy,Stavros Papadopoulos; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The tremendous growth of the Internet has significantly reduced the cost ofobtaining and sharing information about individuals; raising many concerns about userprivacy. Spatial queries pose an additional threat to privacy because the location of a querymay be sufficient to reveal sensitive information about the querier. In this paper we focus onk nearest neighbor (kNN) queries and define the notion of strong location privacy; whichrenders a query indistinguishable from any location in the data space. We argue thatprevious work fails to support this property for arbitrary kNN search. Towards this end; weintroduce methods that offer strong location privacy; by integrating private informationretrieval (PIR) functionality. Specifically; we employ secure hardware-aided PIR; which hasbeen proven very efficient and is currently considered as a practical mechanism for PIR …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,152
Authenticated join processing in outsourced databases,Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Stavros Papadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Database outsourcing requires that a query server constructs a proof of resultcorrectness; which can be verified by the client using the data owner's signature. Previousauthentication techniques deal with range queries on a single relation using anauthenticated data structure (ADS). On the other hand; authenticated join processing isinherently more complex than ranges since only the base relations (but not theircombination) are signed by the owner. In this paper; we present three novel join algorithmsdepending on the ADS availability:(i) Authenticated Indexed Sort Merge Join (AISM); whichutilizes a single ADS on the join attribute;(ii) Authenticated Index Merge Join (AIM) thatrequires an ADS (on the join attribute) for both relations; and (iii) Authenticated Sort MergeJoin (ASM); which does not rely on any ADS. We experimentally demonstrate that the …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,110
Spatial outsourcing for location-based services,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,The embedding of positioning capabilities in mobile devices and the emergence of location-based applications have created novel opportunities for utilizing several types of multi-dimensional data through spatial outsourcing. In this setting; a data owner (DO) delegates itsdata management tasks to a location-based service (LBS) that processes queries originatingfrom several clients/subscribers. Because the LBS is not the real owner of the data; it mustprove (to each client) the correctness of query output using an authenticated structuresigned by the DO. Currently there is very narrow selection of multi-dimensionalauthenticated structures; among which the VR-tree is the best choice. Our first contribution isthe MR-tree; a novel index suitable for spatial outsourcing. We show; analytically andexperimentally; that the MR-tree outperforms the VR-tree; usually by orders of magnitude …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,92
Authenticated indexing for outsourced spatial databases,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract In spatial database outsourcing; a data owner delegates its data management tasksto a location-based service (LBS); which indexes the data with an authenticated datastructure (ADS). The LBS receives queries (ranges; nearest neighbors) originating fromseveral clients/subscribers. Each query initiates the computation of a verification object (VO)based on the ADS. The VO is returned to the client that can verify the result correctnessusing the public key of the owner. Our first contribution is the MR-tree; a space-efficient ADSthat supports fast query processing and verification. Our second contribution is the MR*-tree;a modified version of the MR-tree; which significantly reduces the VO size through a novelembedding technique. Finally; whereas most ADSs must be constructed and maintained bythe owner; we outsource the MR-and MR*-tree construction and maintenance to the LBS …,The VLDB Journal,2009,90
Continuous authentication on relational streams,Stavros Papadopoulos; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract According to the database outsourcing model; a data owner delegates databasefunctionality to a third-party service provider; which answers queries received from clients.Authenticated query processing enables the clients to verify the correctness of query results.Despite the abundance of methods for authenticated processing in conventional databases;there is limited work on outsourced data streams. Stream environments pose newchallenges such as the need for fast structure updating; support for continuous queryprocessing and authentication; and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically; inaddition to the correctness of individual results; the client must be able to verify that there areno missing results in between data updates. This paper presents a comprehensive set ofmethods covering relational streams.

Practical differential privacy via grouping and smoothing,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos,Abstract We address one-time publishing of non-overlapping counts with ε-differentialprivacy. These statistics are useful in a wide and important range of applications; includingtransactional; traffic and medical data analysis. Prior work on the topic publishes suchstatistics with prohibitively low utility in several practical scenarios. Towards this end; wepresent GS; a method that pre-processes the counts by elaborately grouping and smoothingthem via averaging. This step acts as a form of preliminary perturbation that diminishessensitivity; and enables GS to achieve ε-differential privacy through low Laplace noiseinjection. The grouping strategy is dictated by a sampling mechanism; which minimizes thesmoothing perturbation. We demonstrate the superiority of GS over its competitors; andconfirm its practicality; via extensive experiments on real datasets.,Proceedings of the 39th international conference on Very Large Data Bases,2013,58
A demonstration of the bigdawg polystore system,Aaron Elmore; Jennie Duggan; Mike Stonebraker; Magdalena Balazinska; Ugur Cetintemel; Vijay Gadepally; Jeffrey Heer; Bill Howe; Jeremy Kepner; Tim Kraska; Samuel Madden; David Maier; Timothy Mattson; Stavros Papadopoulos; Jeff Parkhurst; Nesime Tatbul; Manasi Vartak; Stan Zdonik,Abstract This paper presents BigDAWG; a reference implementation of a new architecturefor" Big Data" applications. Such applications not only call for large-scale analytics; but alsofor real-time streaming support; smaller analytics at interactive speeds; data visualization;and cross-storage-system queries. Guided by the principle that" one size does not fit all"; webuild on top of a variety of storage engines; each designed for a specialized use case. Toillustrate the promise of this approach; we demonstrate its effectiveness on a hospitalapplication using data from an intensive care unit (ICU). This complex application serves theneeds of doctors and researchers and provides real-time support for streams of patient data.It showcases novel approaches for querying across multiple storage engines; datavisualization; and scalable real-time analytics.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,55
Differentially private event sequences over infinite streams,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Xiaokui Xiao; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Numerous applications require continuous publication of statistics or monitoringpurposes; such as real-time traffic analysis; timely disease outbreak discovery; and socialtrends observation. These statistics may be derived from sensitive user data and; hence;necessitate privacy preservation. A notable paradigm for offering strong privacy guaranteesin statistics publishing is ε-differential privacy. However; there is limited literature that adaptsthis concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an infinite stream of"events"(ie; data items generated by the users); and published periodically. These works aimat hiding a single event over the entire stream. We argue that; in most practical scenarios;sensitive information is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous timeinstances. Towards this end; we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy over infinite …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,55
Topologically sorted skylines for partially ordered domains,Dimitris Sacharidis; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,The vast majority of work on skyline queries considers totally ordered domains; whereas inmany applications some attributes are partially ordered; as for instance; domains of setvalues; hierarchies; intervals and preferences. The only work addressing this issue haslimited progressiveness and pruning ability; and it is only applicable to static skylines. Thispaper overcomes these problems with the following contributions.(i) We introduce a genericframework; termed TSS; for handling partially ordered domains using topological sorting.(ii)We propose a novel dominance check that eliminates false hits/misses; further enhancingprogressiveness and pruning ability.(iii) We extend our methodology to dynamic skylineswith respect to an input query. In this case; the dominance relationships change according tothe query specification; and their computation is rather complex. We perform an extensive …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

A general framework for geo-social query processing,Nikos Armenatzoglou; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract The proliferation of GPS-enabledmobile devises and the popularity of socialnetworking have recently led to the rapid growth of Geo-Social Networks (GeoSNs). GeoSNshave created a fertile ground for novel location-based social interactions and advertising.These can be facilitated by GeoSN queries; which extract useful information combining boththe social relationships and the current location of the users. This paper constitutes the firstsystematic work on GeoSN query processing. We propose a general framework that offersflexible data management and algorithmic design. Our architecture segregates the social;geographical and query processing modules. Each GeoSN query is processed via atransparent combination of primitive queries issued to the social and geographical modules.We demonstrate the power of our framework by introducing several" basic" and" …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,44
Exact in-network aggregation with integrity and confidentiality,Stavros Papadopoulos; Aggelos Kiayias; Dimitris Papadias,In-network aggregation reduces the energy cost of processing aggregate queries (such asSUM; MAX; etc.) in wireless sensor networks. Recently; research has focused on secure in-network aggregation; motivated by the following two scenarios: 1) the sensors are deployedin open and unsafe environments; and 2) the aggregation process is outsourced to anuntrustworthy service. Despite the bulk of work on the topic; there is currently no solutionproviding both integrity and confidentiality in the above scenarios. Moreover; existingsolutions either return approximate results; or have limited applicability to certain types ofaggregate queries. Our paper is the first work that provides both integrity and confidentialityin the aforementioned scenarios; while covering a wide range of aggregates and returningexact results. We initially present SIES; a scheme that solves exact SUM queries through …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,40
Nearest keyword search in XML documents,Yufei Tao; Stavros Papadopoulos; Cheng Sheng; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract This paper studies the nearest keyword (NK) problem on XML documents. Ingeneral; the dataset is a tree where each node is associated with one or more keywords.Given a node q and a keyword w; an NK query returns the node that is nearest to q amongall the nodes associated with w. NK search is not only useful as a stand-alone operator butalso as a building brick for important tasks such as XPath query evaluation and keywordsearch. We present an indexing scheme that answers NK queries efficiently; in terms of bothpractical and worst-case performance. The query cost is provably logarithmic to the numberof nodes carrying the query keyword. The proposed scheme occupies space linear to thedataset size; and can be constructed by a fast algorithm. Extensive experimentation confirmsour theoretical findings; and demonstrates the effectiveness of NK retrieval as a primitive …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,35
Secure and efficient in-network processing of exact SUM queries,Stavros Papadopoulos; Aggelos Kiayias; Dimitris Papadias,In-network aggregation is a popular methodology adopted in wireless sensor networks;which reduces the energy expenditure in processing aggregate queries (such as SUM;MAX; etc.) over the sensor readings. Recently; research has focused on secure in-networkaggregation; motivated (i) by the fact that the sensors are usually deployed in open andunsafe environments; and (ii) by new trends such as outsourcing; where the aggregationprocess is delegated to an untrustworthy service. This new paradigm necessitates thefollowing key security properties: data confidentiality; integrity; authentication; and freshness.The majority of the existing work on the topic is either unsuitable for large-scale sensornetworks; or provides only approximate answers for SUM queries (as well as theirderivatives; eg; COUNT; AVG; etc). Moreover; there is currently no approach offering both …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,33
Separating authentication from query execution in outsourced databases,Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; Weiwei Cheng; Kian-Lee Tan,In the database outsourcing paradigm; a data owner (DO) delegates its DBMSadministration to a specialized service provider (SP) that receives and processes queriesfrom clients. The traditional outsourcing model (TOM) requires that the DO and the SPmaintain authenticated data structures to enable authentication of query results. In thispaper; we present SAE; a novel outsourcing model that separates authentication from queryexecution. Specifically; the DO does not perform any task except for maintaining its dataset(if there are updates). The SP only stores the DO's dataset and computes the query resultsusing a conventional DBMS. All security-related tasks are outsourced to a separate trustedentity (TE); which maintains limited authentication information about the original dataset. Aclient contacts the TE when it wishes to establish the correctness of a result returned by …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,32
Lightweight authentication of linear algebraic queries on data streams,Stavros Papadopoulos; Graham Cormode; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract We consider a stream outsourcing setting; where a data owner delegates themanagement of a set of disjoint data streams to an untrusted server. The ownerauthenticates his streams via signatures. The server processes continuous queries on theunion of the streams for clients trusted by the owner. Along with the results; the server sendsproofs of result correctness derived from the owner's signatures; which are easily verifiableby the clients. We design novel constructions for a collection of fundamental problems overstreams represented as linear algebraic queries. In particular; our basic schemesauthenticate dynamic vector sums and dot products; as well as dynamic matrix products.These techniques can be adapted for authenticating a wide range of important operations instreaming environments; including group by queries; joins; in-network aggregation …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,26
pCloud: A distributed system for practical PIR,Stavros Papadopoulos; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Computational Private Information Retrieval (cPIR) protocols allow a client to retrieve one bitfrom a database; without the server inferring any information about the queried bit. Theseprotocols are too costly in practice because they invoke complex arithmetic operations forevery bit of the database. In this paper; we present pCloud; a distributed system thatconstitutes the first attempt toward practical cPIR. Our approach assumes a disk-basedarchitecture that retrieves one page with a single query. Using a striping technique; wedistribute the database to a number of cooperative peers; and leverage their computationalresources to process cPIR queries in parallel. We implemented pCloud on the PlanetLabnetwork; and experimented extensively with several system parameters. Our results indicatethat pCloud reduces considerably the query response time compared to the traditional …,IEEE transactions on dependable and secure computing,2012,20
Practical private range search revisited,Ioannis Demertzis; Stavros Papadopoulos; Odysseas Papapetrou; Antonios Deligiannakis; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract We consider a data owner that outsources its dataset to an untrusted server. Theowner wishes to enable the server to answer range queries on a single attribute; withoutcompromising the privacy of the data and the queries. There are several schemes on"practical" private range search (mainly in Databases venues) that attempt to strike a trade-offbetween efficiency and security. Nevertheless; these methods either lack provable securityguarantees; or permit unacceptable privacy leakages. In this paper; we take aninterdisciplinary approach; which combines the rigor of Security formulations and proofs withefficient Data Management techniques. We construct a wide set of novel schemes withrealistic security/performance trade-offs; adopting the notion of Searchable SymmetricEncryption (SSE) primarily proposed for keyword search. We reduce range search to …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,18
The TileDB array data storage manager,Stavros Papadopoulos; Kushal Datta; Samuel Madden; Timothy Mattson,Abstract We present a novel storage manager for multi-dimensional arrays that arise inscientific applications; which is part of a larger scientific data management system calledTileDB. In contrast to existing solutions; TileDB is optimized for both dense and sparsearrays. Its key idea is to organize array elements into ordered collections called fragments.Each fragment is dense or sparse; and groups contiguous array elements into data tiles offixed capacity. The organization into fragments turns random writes into sequential writes;and; coupled with a novel read algorithm; leads to very efficient reads. TileDB enablesparallelization via multi-threading and multi-processing; offering thread-/process-safety andatomicity via lightweight locking. We show that TileDB delivers comparable performance tothe HDF5 dense array storage manager; while providing much faster random writes. We …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,17
Authenticated multistep nearest neighbor search,Stavros Papadopoulos; Lixing Wang; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Panagiotis Karras,Multistep processing is commonly used for nearest neighbor (NN) and similarity search inapplications involving high-dimensional data and/or costly distance computations. Today;many such applications require a proof of result correctness. In this setting; clients issue NNqueries to a server that maintains a database signed by a trusted authority. The serverreturns the NN set along with supplementary information that permits result verification usingthe data set signature. An adaptation of the multistep NN algorithm incurs prohibitivenetwork overhead due to the transmission of false hits; ie; records that are not in the NN set;but are nevertheless necessary for its verification. In order to alleviate this problem; wepresent a novel technique that reduces the size of each false hit.

Continuous spatial authentication,Stavros Papadopoulos; Yin Yang; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Recent advances in wireless communications and positioning devices havegenerated a tremendous amount of interest in the continuous monitoring of spatial queries.However; such applications can incur a heavy burden on the data owner (DO); due to veryfrequent location updates. Database outsourcing is a viable solution; whereby the DOdelegates its database functionality to a service provider (SP) that has the infrastructure andresources to handle the high workload. In this framework; authenticated query processingenables the clients to verify the correctness of the query results that are returned by the SP.In addition to correctness; the dynamic nature of the monitored data requires the provisionfor temporal completeness; ie; the clients must be able to verify that there are no missingresults in between data updates.

Continuous medoid queries over moving objects,Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Sacharidis; Kyriakos Mouratidis,Abstract In the k-medoid problem; given a dataset P; we are asked to choose k points in P asthe medoids. The optimal medoid set minimizes the average Euclidean distance betweenthe points in P and their closest medoid. Finding the optimal k medoids is NP hard; andexisting algorithms aim at approximate answers; ie; they compute medoids that achieve asmall; yet not minimal; average distance. Similarly in this paper; we also aim at approximatesolutions. We consider; however; the continuous version of the problem; where the points inP move and our task is to maintain the medoid set on-the-fly (trying to keep the averagedistance small). To the best of our knowledge; this work constitutes the first attempt oncontinuous medoid queries. First; we consider centralized monitoring; where the pointsissue location updates whenever they move.

Taking authenticated range queries to arbitrary dimensions,Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Stavros Papadopoulos; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract We study the problem of authenticated multi-dimensional range queries overoutsourced databases; where an owner outsources its database to an untrusted server;which maintains it and answers queries to clients. Previous schemes either scaleexponentially in the number of query dimensions; or rely on heuristic data structures withoutprovable bounds. Most importantly; existing work requires an exponential; in the databaseattributes; number of structures to support queries on every possible combination ofdimensions in the database. In this paper; we propose the first schemes that (i) scale linearlywith the number of dimensions; and (ii) support queries on any set of dimensions with linearin the number of attributes setup cost and storage. We achieve this through an elaboratefusion of novel and existing set-operation sub-protocols.

An Emerging Role for Polystores in Precision Medicine,Edmon Begoli; J Blair Christian; Vijay Gadepally; Stavros Papadopoulos,Abstract Medical data is organically heterogeneous; and it usually varies significantly in bothsize and composition. Yet; this data is also a key for the recent and promising field ofprecision medicine; which focuses on identifying and tailoring appropriate medicaltreatments for the needs of the individual patients; based on their specific conditions; theirmedical history; lifestyle; genetic; and other individual factors. As we; and a databasecommunity at large; recognize that a “one size does not fit all” solution is required to workwith such data; we present our observations based on our experiences; and the applicationsin the field of precision medicine. We make the case for the use of polystore architecture;how it applies for precision medicine; we discuss the reference architecture; describe someof its critical components (array database); and discuss the specific types of analysis that …,VLDB Workshop on Data Management and Analytics for Medicine and Healthcare,2017,1
Secure Computation in Online Social Networks.,Foteini Baldimtsi; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Stavros Papadopoulos; Alessandra Scafuro; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Apart from their numerous other benefits; online social networks (OSNs) allow usersto jointly compute on each other's data (eg; profiles; geo-locations; medical records; etc.).Privacy issues naturally arise in this setting due to the sensitive nature of the exchangedinformation. Ideally; nothing about a user's data should be revealed to the OSN provider or“non-friend” users; and even her “friends” should only learn the output of a joint computation.In this work we propose the first security framework to capture these strong privacyguarantees for general-purpose computation. We also achieve two additional attractiveproperties: users do not need to be online while their friends compute on their data; and anyuser value uploaded at the server can be repeatedly used in multiple computations.

Server-Aided Secure Computation with Off-line Parties,Foteini Baldimtsi; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Stavros Papadopoulos; Alessandra Scafuro; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) allow users to jointly compute on each other's data(eg; profiles; geo-locations; etc.).

Engineering Methods for Differentially Private Histograms: Efficiency Beyond Utility,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract: Publishing histograms with $\epsilon $-differential privacy has been studiedextensively in the literature. Existing schemes aim at maximizing the utility of the publisheddata; while previous experimental evaluations analyze the privacy/utility trade-off. In thispaper we provide the first experimental evaluation of differentially private methods that goesbeyond utility; emphasizing also on another important aspect; namely efficiency. Towardsthis end; we first observe that all existing schemes are comprised of a small set of commonblocks. We then optimize and choose the best implementation for each block; determine thecombinations of blocks that capture the entire literature; and propose novel blockcombinations. We qualitatively assess the quality of the schemes based on the skyline ofefficiency and utility; ie; based on whether a method is dominated on both aspects or not …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.03440,2015,*
Differentially Private Histograms for Range-Sum Queries: A Modular Approach,Georgios Kellaris; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias,ABSTRACT We focus on the problem of differentially private histogram publication; for range-sum query answering. Specifically; we derive a histogram from a given dataset; such that (i)it satisfies ϵ-differential privacy; and (ii) it achieves high utility for queries that request thesum of contiguous histogram bins. Existing schemes are distinguished into two categories:fast but oblivious to utility optimizations that exploit the data characteristics; and data-awarebut slow. We are the first to address this problem with emphasis on both efficiency and utility.Towards this goal; we formulate a principled approach; which defines a small set of simplemodules; based on which we can devise a variety of more complex schemes. We firstexpress the state-of-the-art methods in terms of these modules; which allows us to identifythe performance bottlenecks. Next; we design novel efficient and effective schemes …,CoRR,2015,*
Practical Private Range Search In Depth,IOANNIS DEMERTZIS; STAVROS PAPADOPOULOS; ODYSSEAS PAPAPETROU; ANTONIOS DELIGIANNAKIS; MINOS GAROFALAKIS; CHARALAMPOS PAPAMANTHOU,We focus on a setting with two parties; a data owner and a server. The owner outsources itsdataset to the server; and gives the latter the authority to answer range queries on a singleattribute. The server is untrusted; and the goal is to protect the privacy of the dataset and thequeries. The owner encrypts its data prior to sending them to the server. The challenge liesin enabling the server to process the owner's queries directly on the encrypted data; whileachieving performance and costs close to the non-private case. The benefits of dataoutsourcing and the importance of privacy have been stressed in numerous earlier works(eg;[18; 59; 62; 66]). Prior work.

TileDB's primary goal is massive scale; where data need tobe stored persistently at a low cost; while allowing rapid access during parallel computation.Contrary to traditional data management systems; TileDB is an embeddable C library thatcan easily be integrated with various higher-level programming languages and scientificcomputing tools. It supports persistent storage on various backends such as POSIXfilesystems; HDFS; Amazon S3; and more.
