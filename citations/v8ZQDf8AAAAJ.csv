Structured databases on the web: Observations and implications,Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Bin He; Chengkai Li; Mitesh Patel; Zhen Zhang,Abstract The Web has been rapidly" deepened" by the prevalence of databases online. Withthe potentially unlimited information hidden behind their query interfaces; this" deep Web" ofsearchable databses is clearly an important frontier for data access. This paper surveys thisrelatively unexplored frontier; measuring characteristics pertinent to both exploring andintegrating structured Web sources. On one hand; our" macro" study surveys the deep Webat large; in April 2004; adopting the random IP-sampling approach; with one millionsamples.(How large is the deep Web? How is it covered by current directory services?) Onthe other hand; our" micro" study surveys source-specific characteristics over 441 sources ineight representative domains; in December 2002.(How" hidden" are deep-Web sources?How do search engines cover their data? How complex and expressive are query forms?) …,ACM sigmod record,2004,562
RankSQL: query algebra and optimization for relational top-k queries,Chengkai Li; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Ihab F Ilyas; Sumin Song,Abstract This paper introduces RankSQL; a system that provides a systematic and principledframework to support efficient evaluations of ranking (top-k) queries in relational databasesystems (RDBMS); by extending relational algebra and query optimization. Previously; top-kquery processing is studied in the middleware scenario or in RDBMS in a" piecemeal"fashion; ie; focusing on specific operator or sitting outside the core of query engines. Incontrast; we aim to support ranking as a first-class database construct. As a key insight; thenew ranking relationship can be viewed as another logical property of data; parallel to the"membership" property of relational data model. While membership is essentially supportedin RDBMS; the same support for ranking is clearly lacking. We address the fundamentalintegration of ranking in RDBMS in a way similar to how membership; ie; Boolean filtering …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,307
Facetedpedia: dynamic generation of query-dependent faceted interfaces for wikipedia,Chengkai Li; Ning Yan; Senjuti B Roy; Lekhendro Lisham; Gautam Das,Abstract This paper proposes Facetedpedia; a faceted retrieval system for informationdiscovery and exploration in Wikipedia. Given the set of Wikipedia articles resulting from akeyword query; Facetedpedia generates a faceted interface for navigating the result articles.Compared with other faceted retrieval systems; Facetedpedia is fully automatic and dynamicin both facet generation and hierarchy construction; and the facets are based on the richsemantic information from Wikipedia. The essence of our approach is to build upon thecollaborative vocabulary in Wikipedia; more specifically the intensive internal structures(hyperlinks) and folksonomy (category system). Given the sheer size and complexity of thiscorpus; the space of possible choices of faceted interfaces is prohibitively large. We proposemetrics for ranking individual facet hierarchies by user's navigational cost; and metrics for …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,110
Supporting ad-hoc ranking aggregates,Chengkai Li; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Ihab F Ilyas,Abstract This paper presents a principled framework for efficient processing of ad-hoc top-k(ranking) aggregate queries; which provide the k groups with the highest aggregates asresults. Essential support of such queries is lacking in current systems; which process thequeries in a naïve materialize-group-sort scheme that can be prohibitively inefficient. Ourframework is based on three fundamental principles. The Upper-Bound Principle dictatesthe requirements of early pruning; and the Group-Ranking and Tuple-Ranking Principlesdictate group-ordering and tuple-ordering requirements. They together guide the queryprocessor toward a provably optimal tuple schedule for aggregate query processing. Wepropose a new execution framework to apply the principles and requirements. We addressthe challenges in realizing the framework and implementing new query operators …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,82
Computational Journalism: A Call to Arms to Database Researchers.,Sarah Cohen; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,The digital age has brought sweeping changes to the news media. While onlineconsumption of news is on the rise; fewer people today read newspapers. Newspaperadvertising revenues fell by a total of 23% in 2007 and 2008; and tumbled 26% more in2009 [1]. This continuing decline of the traditional news media affects not only how news aredisseminated and consumed; but also how much and what types of news are produced;which have profound impact on the well-being of our society. In the past; we have come torely heavily upon the traditional news organizations for their investigative reporting to holdgovernments; corporations; and powerful individuals accountable to our society. The declineof traditional media has led to dwindling support for this style of journalism; which isconsidered as cost-intensive and having little revenue-generating potential.

Supporting ranking and clustering as generalized order-by and group-by,Chengkai Li; Min Wang; Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract The Boolean semantics of SQL queries cannot adequately capture the" fuzzy"preferences and" soft" criteria required in non-traditional data retrieval applications. One wayto solve this problem is to add a flavor of" information retrieval" into database queries byallowing fuzzy query conditions and flexibly supporting grouping and ranking of the queryresults within the DBMS engine. While ranking is already supported by all major commercialDBMSs natively; support of flexibly grouping is still very limited (ie; group-by). In this paper;we propose to generalize group-by to enable flexible grouping (clustering specifically) of thequery results. Different from clustering in data mining applications; our focus is on supportingefficient clustering of Boolean results generated at query time. Moreover; we propose tointegrate ranking and clustering with Boolean conditions; forming a new type of …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,47
XML Query Optimization in Map-Reduce.,Leonidas Fegaras; Chengkai Li; Upa Gupta; Jijo Philip,ABSTRACT We present a novel query language for large-scale analysis of XML data on amap-reduce environment; called MRQL; that is expressive enough to capture most commondata analysis tasks and at the same time is amenable to optimization. Our evaluation plansare constructed using a small number of higher-order physical operators that are directlyimplementable on existing map-reduce systems; such as Hadoop. We report on a prototypesystem implementation and we show some preliminary results on evaluating MRQL querieson a small cluster of PCs running Hadoop.,WebDB,2011,40
Querying knowledge graphs by example entity tuples,Nandish Jayaram; Arijit Khan; Chengkai Li; Xifeng Yan; Ramez Elmasri,We witness an unprecedented proliferation of knowledge graphs that record millions ofentities and their relationships. While knowledge graphs are structure-flexible and content-rich; they are difficult to use. The challenge lies in the gap between their overwhelmingcomplexity and the limited database knowledge of non-professional users.

An optimization framework for map-reduce queries,Leonidas Fegaras; Chengkai Li; Upa Gupta,Abstract We present an effective optimization framework for general SQL-like map-reducequeries; which is based on a novel query algebra and uses a small number of higher-orderphysical operators that are directly implementable on existing map-reduce systems; such asHadoop. Although our framework is applicable to any SQL-like map-reduce query language;we focus on a powerful query language; called MRQL. Current map-reduce querylanguages; such as HiveQL and PigLatin; enable users to plug-in custom map-reducescripts into queries for those jobs that cannot be declaratively coded in the query language;which may result to suboptimal; error-prone; and hard-to-maintain code. In contrast to theselanguages; MRQL is expressive enough to capture most of these computations indeclarative form and at the same time is amenable to optimization.

Query routing: Finding ways in the maze of the DeepWeb,Govind Kabra; Chengkai Li; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,This paper presents a source selection system based on attribute co-occurrence frameworkfor ranking and selecting Deep Web sources that provide information relevant to usersrequirement. Given the huge number of heterogeneous Deep Web data sources; the endusers may not know the sources that can satisfy their information needs. Selecting andranking sources in relevance to the user requirements is challenging. Our system findsappropriate sources for such users by allowing them to input just an imprecise initial query.As a key insight; we observe that the semantics and relationships between deep Websources are self-revealing through their query interfaces; and in essence; through the co-occurrences between attributes. Based on this insight; we design a co-occurrence basedattribute graph for capturing the relevances of attributes; and using them in ranking of …,Web Information Retrieval and Integration; 2005.

One size does not fit all: Toward user-and query-dependent ranking for web databases,Aditya Telang; Chengkai Li; Sharma Chakravarthy,With the emergence of the deep web; searching web databases in domains such asvehicles; real estate; etc.; has become a routine task. One of the problems in this context isranking the results of a user query. Earlier approaches for addressing this problem haveused frequencies of database values; query logs; and user profiles. A common thread inmost of these approaches is that ranking is done in a user-and/or query-independentmanner. This paper proposes a novel query-and user-dependent approach for rankingquery results in web databases. We present a ranking model; based on two complementarynotions of user and query similarity; to derive a ranking function for a given user query. Thisfunction is acquired from a sparse workload comprising of several such ranking functionsderived for various user-query pairs. The model is based on the intuition that similar users …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,29

On skyline groups,Nan Zhang; Chengkai Li; Naeemul Hassan; Sundaresan Rajasekaran; Gautam Das,We formulate and investigate the novel problem of finding the skyline k-tuple groups from ann-tuple data set-ie; groups of k tuples which are not dominated by any other group of equalsize; based on aggregate-based group dominance relationship. The major technicalchallenge is to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the search space ofskyline groups. To this end; we first show that the anti-monotonic property in the well-knownApriori algorithm does not hold for skyline group pruning. Then; we identify two anti-monotonic properties with varying degrees of applicability: order-specific property whichapplies to SUM; MIN; and MAX as well as weak candidate-generation property whichapplies to MIN and MAX only. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data setsverify that the proposed algorithms achieve orders of magnitude performance gain over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,27
New ideas track: testing mapreduce-style programs,Christoph Csallner; Leonidas Fegaras; Chengkai Li,Abstract MapReduce has become a common programming model for processing very largeamounts of data; which is needed in a spectrum of modern computing applications. Todayseveral MapReduce implementations and execution systems exist and many MapReduceprograms are being developed and deployed in practice. However; developing MapReduceprograms is not always an easy task. The programming model makes programs prone toseveral MapReduce-specific bugs. That is; to produce deterministic results; a MapReduceprogram needs to satisfy certain high-level correctness conditions. A violating program mayyield different output values on the same input data; based on low-level infrastructure eventssuch as network latency; scheduling decisions; etc. Current MapReduce systems and toolsare lacking in support for checking these conditions and reporting violations.

RankSQL: supporting ranking queries in relational database management systems,Chengkai Li; Mohamed A Soliman; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Ihab F Ilyas,Abstract Ranking queries (or top-k queries) are dominant in many emerging applications;eg; similarity queries in multimedia databases; searching Web databases; middleware; anddata mining. The increasing importance of top-k queries warrants an efficient support ofranking in the relational database management system (RDBMS) and has recently gainedthe attention of the research community. Top-k queries aim at providing only the top k queryresults; according to a user-specified ranking function; which in many cases is an aggregateof multiple criteria. The following is an example top-k query.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,27
Toward computational fact-checking,You Wu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,Abstract Our news are saturated with claims of" facts" made from data. Database researchhas in the past focused on how to answer queries; but has not devoted much attention todiscerning more subtle qualities of the resulting claims; eg; is a claim" cherry-picking"? Thispaper proposes a framework that models claims based on structured data as parameterizedqueries. A key insight is that we can learn a lot about a claim by perturbing its parametersand seeing how its conclusion changes. This framework lets us formulate practical fact-checking tasks---reverse-engineering (often intentionally) vague claims; and counteringquestionable claims---as computational problems. Along with the modeling framework; wedevelop an algorithmic framework that enables efficient instantiations of" meta" algorithmsby supplying appropriate algorithmic building blocks.

Composing XSL transformations with XML publishing views,Chengkai Li; Philip Bohannon; PPS Narayan,Abstract While the XML Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) was not designedas a query language; it is well-suited for many query-like operations on XML documentsincluding selecting and restructuring data. Further; it actively fulfills the role of an XML querylanguage in modern applications and is widely supported by application platform software.However; the use of database techniques to optimize and execute XSLT has only recentlyreceived attention in the research community. In this paper; we focus on the case where XSLtransformations are to be run on XML documents defined as views of relational databases.For a subset of XSLT; we present an algorithm to compose a transformation with an XMLview; eliminating the need for the XSLT execution. We then describe how to extend thisalgorithm to handle several additional features of XSLT; including a proposed approach …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,25
Detecting check-worthy factual claims in presidential debates,Naeemul Hassan; Chengkai Li; Mark Tremayne,Abstract Public figures such as politicians make claims about" facts" all the time. Journalistsand citizens spend a good amount of time checking the veracity of such claims. Towardautomatic fact checking; we developed tools to find check-worthy factual claims from naturallanguage sentences. Specifically; we prepared a US presidential debate dataset and builtclassification models to distinguish check-worthy factual claims from non-factual claims andunimportant factual claims. We also identified the most-effective features based on theirimpact on the classification models' accuracy.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,24
Entity-relationship queries over wikipedia,Xiaonan Li; Chengkai Li; Cong Yu,Abstract Wikipedia is the largest user-generated knowledge base. We propose a structuredquery mechanism; entity-relationship query; for searching entities in the Wikipedia corpus bytheir properties and interrelationships. An entity-relationship query consists of multiplepredicates on desired entities. The semantics of each predicate is specified with keywords.Entity-relationship query searches entities directly over text instead of preextractedstructured data stores. This characteristic brings two benefits:(1) Query semantics can beintuitively expressed by keywords;(2) It only requires rudimentary entity annotation; which issimpler than explicitly extracting and reasoning about complex semantic information beforequery-time. We present a ranking framework for general entity-relationship queries and aposition-based Bounded Cumulative Model (BCM) for accurate ranking of query answers …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2012,22
Method and system for combining ranking and clustering in a database management system,*,A system for combining ranking and clustering in a query. Bit vectors are intersected onBoolean attributes resulting in a vector. Two summary grids are constructed by intersectingbit vectors on clustering and ranking attributes. The vector is intersected with each summarygrid to obtain a filtered clustering and ranking grid. An algorithm is applied on the clusteringgrid to obtain clusters. Vectors associated with buckets in the clusters are intersectedresulting in one vector for each cluster. The vector corresponding to each cluster isintersected with the ranking grid to obtain a modified grid. Buckets are pruned according tobounds of each bucket in the modified grid and a predetermined number to obtain candidatebuckets containing the predetermined number of data. The data are retrieved and a rankingscore is calculated. The top predetermined number of data are sorted according to …,*,2008,22
GQBE: Querying knowledge graphs by example entity tuples,Nandish Jayaram; Mahesh Gupta; Arijit Khan; Chengkai Li; Xifeng Yan; Ramez Elmasri,We present GQBE; a system that presents a simple and intuitive mechanism to query largeknowledge graphs. Answers to tasks such as “list university professors who have designedsome programming languages and also won an award in Computer Science” are best foundin knowledge graphs that record entities and their relationships. Real-world knowledgegraphs are difficult to use due to their sheer size and complexity and the challenging task ofwriting complex structured graph queries. Toward better usability of query systems overknowledge graphs; GQBE allows users to query knowledge graphs by example entity tupleswithout writing complex queries. In this demo we present: 1) a detailed description of thevarious features and user-friendly GUI of GQBE; 2) a brief description of the systemarchitecture; and 3) a demonstration scenario that we intend to show the audience.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,19

The majortechnical challenge is to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the searchspace of skyline groups. To this end; we show that the anti-monotonic property in the well-known Apriori algorithm does not hold for skyline group pruning. We then identify order-specific property which applies to SUM; MIN; and MAX and weak candidate-generationproperty which applies to MIN and MAX only. Experimental results on both real and syntheticdatasets verify that the proposed algorithms achieve orders of magnitude performance gainover a baseline method.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,19
The quest to automate fact-checking,Naeemul Hassan; Bill Adair; James T Hamilton; Chengkai Li; Mark Tremayne; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,The growing movement of political fact-checking plays an important role in increasingdemocratic accountability and improving political discourse [7; 3]. Politicians and mediafigures make claims about “facts” all the time; but the new army of fact-checkers can oftenexpose claims that are false; exaggerated or half-truths. The number of active fact-checkingwebsites has grown from 44 a year ago to 64 in 2015; according the Duke Reporters's Lab.1 The challenge is that the human fact-checkers frequently have difficulty keeping up withthe rapid spread of misinformation. Technology; social media and new forms of journalismhave made it easier than ever to disseminate falsehoods and half-truths faster than the fact-checkers can expose them. There are several reasons that the falsehoods frequentlyoutpace the truth. One reason is that fact-checking is an intellectually demanding and …,world,2015,18
Prominent streak discovery in sequence data,Xiao Jiang; Chengkai Li; Ping Luo; Min Wang; Yong Yu,Abstract This paper studies the problem of prominent streak discovery in sequence data.Given a sequence of values; a prominent streak is a long consecutive subsequenceconsisting of only large (small) values. For finding prominent streaks; we make theobservation that prominent streaks are skyline points in two dimensions-streak intervallength and minimum value in the interval. Our solution thus hinges upon the idea to separatethe two steps in prominent streak discovery'candidate streak generation and skylineoperation over candidate streaks. For candidate generation; we propose the concept of localprominent streak (LPS). We prove that prominent streaks are a subset of LPSs and thenumber of LPSs is less than the length of a data sequence; in comparison with the quadraticnumber of candidates produced by a brute-force baseline method.

On one of the few objects,You Wu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,Abstract Objects with multiple numeric attributes can be compared within any"subspace"(subset of attributes). In applications such as computational journalism; users areinterested in claims of the form: Karl Malone is one of the only two players in NBA historywith at least 25;000 points; 12;000 rebounds; and 5;000 assists in one's career. Onechallenge in identifying such" one-of-the-k" claims (k= 2 above) is ensuring their"interestingness". A small k is not a good indicator for interestingness; as one can often makesuch claims for many objects by increasing the dimensionality of the subspace considered.We propose a uniqueness-based interestingness measure for one-of-the-few claims that isintuitive for non-technical users; and we design algorithms for finding all interesting claims(across all subspaces) from a dataset.

Extracting storm-centric characteristics from raw rainfall data for storm analysis and mining,Kulsawasd Jitkajornwanich; Ramez Elmasri; John McEnery; Chengkai Li,Abstract Most rainfall data is stored in formats that are not easy to analyze and mine. In theseformats; the amount of data is enormous. In this paper; we propose techniques to summarizethe raw rainfall data into a model that facilitates storm analysis and mining; and reduces thedata size. The result is to convert raw rainfall data into meaningful storm-centric data; whichis then stored in a relational database for easy analysis and mining. The size of the stormdata is less than 1% of the size of the raw data. We can determine the spatio-temporalcharacteristics of a storm; such as how big a storm is; how many sites are covered; and whatis its overall depth (precipitation) and duration. We present formal definitions for the storm-related concepts that are needed in our data conversion. Then we describe stormidentification algorithms based on these concepts.

VIIQ: auto-suggestion enabled visual interface for interactive graph query formulation,Nandish Jayaram; Sidharth Goyal; Chengkai Li,Abstract We present VIIQ (pronounced as wick); an interactive and iterative visual queryformulation interface that helps users construct query graphs specifying their exact queryintent. Heterogeneous graphs are increasingly used to represent complex relationships inschemaless data; which are usually queried using query graphs. Existing graph querysystems offer little help to users in easily choosing the exact labels of the edges and verticesin the query graph. VIIQ helps users easily specify their exact query intent by providing avisual interface that lets them graphically add various query graph components; backed byan edge suggestion mechanism that suggests edges relevant to the user's query intent. Inthis demo we present: 1) a detailed description of the various features and user-friendlygraphical interface of VIIQ; 2) a brief description of the edge suggestion algorithm; and 3) …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,11

Given an append-only database; upon the arrival of a new tuple;FactWatcher monitors if the tuple triggers any new facts. Its algorithms efficiently search forfacts without exhaustively testing all possible ones. Furthermore; FactWatcher providesmultiple features in striving for an end-to-end system; including fact ranking; fact-to-statement translation and keyword-based fact search.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,11
Incremental discovery of prominent situational facts,Afroza Sultana; Naeemul Hassan; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,We study the novel problem of finding new; prominent situational facts; which are emergingstatements about objects that stand out within certain contexts. Many such facts arenewsworthy-eg; an athlete's outstanding performance in a game; or a viral video'simpressive popularity. Effective and efficient identification of these facts assists journalists inreporting; one of the main goals of computational journalism. Technically; we consider anever-growing table of objects with dimension and measure attributes. A situational fact is a“contextual” skyline tuple that stands out against historical tuples in a context; specified by aconjunctive constraint involving dimension attributes; when a set of measure attributes arecompared. New tuples are constantly added to the table; reflecting events happening in thereal world. Our goal is to discover constraint-measure pairs that qualify a new tuple as a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,11
Set predicates in sql: Enabling set-level comparisons for dynamically formed groups,Chengkai Li; Bin He; Ning Yan; Muhammad Assad Safiullah,In data warehousing and OLAP applications; scalar-level predicates in SQL becomeincreasingly inadequate to support a class of operations that require set-level comparisonsemantics; ie; comparing a group of tuples with multiple values. Currently; complex SQLqueries composed by scalar-level operations are often formed to obtain even very simple set-level semantics. Such queries are not only difficult to write but also challenging for adatabase engine to optimize; thus can result in costly evaluation. This paper proposes toaugment SQL with set predicate; to bring out otherwise obscured set-level semantics. Westudied two approaches to processing set predicates-an aggregate function-basedapproach and a bitmap index-based approach. Moreover; we designed a histogram-basedprobabilistic method of set predicate selectivity estimation; for optimizing queries with …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,11
Enabling data retrieval: by ranking and beyond,Chengkai Li,The ubiquitous usage of databases for managing structured data; compounded with theexpanded reach of the Internet to end users; has brought forward new scenarios of dataretrieval. Users often want to express non-traditional fuzzy queries with soft criteria; incontrast to Boolean queries; and to explore what choices are available in databases andhow they match the query criteria. Conventional database management systems (DBMSs)have become increasingly inadequate for such new scenarios. Towards enabling dataretrieval; this thesis first studies how to fundamentally integrate ranking into databases. Webuilt RankSQL; a DBMS that provides systematic and principled support of ranking queries.With a new ranking algebra and an extended query optimizer for the algebra; RankSQLcaptures ranking as a first-class construct in databases; together with traditional Boolean …,*,2007,11
A structure-driven yield-aware web form crawler: building a database of online databases,Bin He; Chengkai Li; David Killian; Mitesh Patel; Yuping Tseng; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,The Web has been rapidly``deepened" by massive databases online: Recent surveys showthat while the surface Web has linked billions of static HTML pages; a far more significantamount of information is``hidden" in the deep Web; behind the query forms of searchabledatabases.

Online Frequent Episode Mining.,Xiang Ao; Ping Luo; Chengkai Li; Fuzhen Zhuang; Qing He,Abstract—Frequent episode mining is a popular framework for discovering sequentialpatterns from sequence data. Previous studies on this topic usually process data offline in abatch mode. However; for fast-growing sequence data; old episodes may become obsoletewhile new useful episodes keep emerging. More importantly; in time-critical applications weneed a fast solution to discovering the latest frequent episodes from growing data. To thisend; we formulate the problem of Online Frequent Episode Mining (OFEM). By introducingthe concept of last episode occurrence within a time window; our solution can detect newminimal episode occurrences efficiently; based on which all recent frequent episodes can bediscovered directly. Additionally; a trie-based data structure; episode trie; is developed tostore minimal episode occurrences in a compact way. We also formally prove the …,ICDE,2015,8

We argue that effectively tackling thisproblem requires solutions to query specification and refinement; development andorganization of domain taxonomies; and designing query templates to incorporate spatialand temporal conditions across multiple domains. We discuss our approaches in designingthe query formulation component for InfoMosaic; our proposed framework for multi-domaininformation integration.,COMAD,2008,8
Discovering general prominent streaks in sequence data,Gensheng Zhang; Xiao Jiang; Ping Luo; Min Wang; Chengkai Li,Abstract This article studies the problem of prominent streak discovery in sequence data.Given a sequence of values; a prominent streak is a long consecutive subsequenceconsisting of only large (small) values; such as consecutive games of outstandingperformance in sports; consecutive hours of heavy network traffic; and consecutive days offrequent mentioning of a person in social media. Prominent streak discovery providesinsightful data patterns for data analysis in many real-world applications and is an enablingtechnique for computational journalism. Given its real-world usefulness and complexity; theresearch on prominent streaks in sequence data opens a spectrum of challenging problems.A baseline approach to finding prominent streaks is a quadratic algorithm that exhaustivelyenumerates all possible streaks and performs pairwise streak dominance comparison …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2014,7
Query-by-keywords (qbk): Query formulation using semantics and feedback,Aditya Telang; Sharma Chakravarthy; Chengkai Li,Abstract The staples of information retrieval have been querying and search; respectively;for structured and unstructured repositories. Processing queries over known; structuredrepositories (eg; Databases) has been well-understood; and search has become ubiquitouswhen it comes to unstructured repositories (eg; Web). Furthermore; searching structuredrepositories has been explored to a limited extent. However; there is not much work inquerying unstructured sources. We argue that querying unstructured sources is the next stepin performing focused retrievals. This paper proposed a new approach to generate queriesfrom search-like inputs for unstructured repositories. Instead of burdening the user withschema details; we believe that pre-discovered semantic information in the form oftaxonomies; relationship of keywords based on context; and attribute & operator …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2009,7
Structured querying of annotation-rich web text with shallow semantics,Xiaonan Li; Chengkai Li; Cong Yu,Abstract Information discovery on the Web has so far been dominated by keyword-baseddocument search. However; recent years have witnessed arising needs from Web users tosearch for named entities; eg; finding all Silicon Valley companies. With existing Web searchengines; users have to digest returned Web pages by themselves to find the answers. Entitysearch has been introduced as a solution to this problem. However; existing entity searchsystems are limited in their capability to address complex information needs that involvemultiple entities and their interrelationships. In this report; we introduce a novel entity-centricstructured querying mechanism called Shallow Semantic Query (SSQ) to overcome thislimitation. We cover two key technical issues with regard to SSQ; ranking and queryprocessing. Comprehensive experiments show that (1) our ranking model beats state-of …,*,2010,6

Politicians and organizations repeatedly make the same false claims. Fakenews floods the cyberspace and even allegedly influenced the 2016 election. In fightingfalse information; the number of active fact-checking organizations has grown from 44 in2014 to 114 in early 2017. 1 Fact-checkers vet claims by investigating relevant data anddocuments and publish their verdicts. For instance; PolitiFact. com; one of the earliest andmost popular fact-checking projects; gives factual claims truthfulness ratings such as True;Mostly True; Half true; Mostly False; False; and even" Pants on Fire". In the US; the electionyear made fact-checking a part of household terminology.

Computational fact checking through query perturbations,You Wu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,Abstract Our media is saturated with claims of “facts” made from data. Database researchhas in the past focused on how to answer queries; but has not devoted much attention todiscerning more subtle qualities of the resulting claims; for example; is a claim “cherry-picking”? This article proposes a framework that models claims based on structured data asparameterized queries. Intuitively; with its choice of the parameter setting; a claim presents aparticular (and potentially biased) view of the underlying data. A key insight is that we canlearn a lot about a claim by “perturbing” its parameters and seeing how its conclusionchanges. For example; a claim is not robust if small perturbations to its parameters canchange its conclusions significantly. This framework allows us to formulate practical fact-checking tasks—reverse-engineering vague claims; and countering questionable claims …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2017,5
Comparing automated factual claim detection against judgments of journalism organizations,Naeemul Hassan; Mark Tremayne; Fatma Arslan; Chengkai Li,ABSTRACT In this research; we deployed an automated fact-checking system (ClaimBuster)on the 2016 presidential primary debates and assessed its performance compared toprofessional news organizations. In real-time; ClaimBuster scored the statements made bycandidates on check-worthiness; the likelihood that the statement contained an importantfactual claim. Its discrimination compared to professional journalists was high. Statementschosen for fact checking by CNN and PolitiFact had been scored much higher byClaimBuster than those not selected. The topics of statements chosen for checking alsomirrored the topics of those scored highly by ClaimBuster. Differences between the politicalparties and individual candidates on the use of factual claims are also presented.,Computation+ Journalism Symposium,2016,5
Crowdsourcing pareto-optimal object finding by pairwise comparisons,Abolfazl Asudeh; Gensheng Zhang; Naeemul Hassan; Chengkai Li; Gergely V Zaruba,Abstract This is the first study of crowdsourcing Pareto-optimal object finding over partialorders and by pairwise comparisons; which has applications in public opinion collection;group decision making; and information exploration. Departing from prior studies oncrowdsourcing skyline and ranking queries; it considers the case where objects do not haveexplicit attributes and preference relations on objects are strict partial orders. The partialorders are derived by aggregating crowdsourcers' responses to pairwise comparisonquestions. The goal is to find all Pareto-optimal objects by the fewest possible questions. Itemploys an iterative question-selection framework. Guided by the principle of eagerlyidentifying non-Pareto optimal objects; the framework only chooses candidate questionswhich must satisfy three conditions. This design is both sufficient and efficient; as it is …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,5
Finding; monitoring; and checking claims computationally based on structured data,Brett Walenz; Y Wu; S Song; Emre Sonmez; Eric Wu; Kevin Wu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Jun Yang; Naeemul Hassan; Afroza Sultana; Gensheng Zhang; Chengkai Li; Cong Yu,“Big data” have arrived. The increasing abundance of data brings many opportunities forjournalism; from discovering interesting stories to fact-checking claims. Unfortunately; theskill of making sense out of data is in short supply; software tools suitable for nontechnicalusers are sorely lacking. The gap between the abundance of data and the shortage ofhuman expertise seems to be widening. Unless we find a way to close this gap; big data willnot achieve its potential for journalism. Moreover; the public may become more susceptibleto “lies; d—ed lies; and statistics” that nitpick data to advance their own arguments.,Computation+ Journalism Symposium,2014,5
Formalization of 2-D spatial ontology and OWL/Protégé realization,Kulsawasd Jitkajornwanich; Ramez Elmasri; Chengkai Li; John McEnery,Abstract Ontology specification is a core component of the Semantic Web; and facilitatesinteroperability among different systems that use distinct models. Developing a spatialontology will allow many applications that have spatial objects to interact. In this paper; weformalize 2-D spatial concepts and operations into a spatial ontology. We show how theseconcepts can be realized in Protégé [30]. The Protégé spatial ontology provides spatial built-ins that can be used to provide a spatial dimension to other ontologies when needed. Wegive some examples of the use of our ontology; which is based on a standard Geometryclass hierarchy [23]; with a few modifications.,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Web Information Management,2011,5
Toward automated fact-checking: Detecting check-worthy factual claims by ClaimBuster,Naeemul Hassan; Fatma Arslan; Chengkai Li; Mark Tremayne,Abstract This paper introduces how ClaimBuster; a fact-checking platform; uses naturallanguage processing and supervised learning to detect important factual claims in politicaldiscourses. The claim spotting model is built using a human-labeled dataset of check-worthyfactual claims from the US general election debate transcripts. The paper explains thearchitecture and the components of the system and the evaluation of the model. It presents acase study of how ClaimBuster live covers the 2016 US presidential election debates andmonitors social media and Australian Hansard for factual claims. It also describes the currentstatus and the long-term goals of ClaimBuster as we keep developing and expanding it.,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,4

For claims based on structured data; we present a system to automatically assessthe quality of claims (beyond their correctness) and counter misleading claims that cherry-pick data to advance their conclusions. The key insight is to model such claims asparameterized queries and consider how parameter perturbations affect their results. Wedemonstrate our system on claims drawn from US congressional voting records; sportsstatistics; and publication records of database researchers.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,4
XML Parsing; SAX/DOM,Chengkai Li,XML access control refers to the practice of limiting access to (parts of) XML data to onlyauthorized users.

Efficient processing of ad-hoc top-k aggregate queries in OLAP,Chengkai Li; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Ihab F Ilyas,In this paper; we develop a principled framework for efficient processing of ad-hoc top-k(ranking) aggregate queries in OLAP. Such queries provide the k groups with the highestaggregates to decision makers. Essential support of top-k aggregate queries is lacking incurrent RDBMSs; which process such queries in a naive and overkill materialize-group-sortscheme; therefore can be prohibitively inefficient. Our new framework is based on twofundamental properties; the Group-Ranking and Tuple-Ranking Principles. The principlesdictate group-ordering and tuple-ordering requirement that together guide the queryprocessor toward the optimal aggregate query processing. To realize the requirements; wepropose a new execution model and address the challenges of implementing new queryoperators; enabling efficient top-k aggregate query plans that are both group-aware and …,*,2005,4
ROLEX: relational on-line exchange with XML,Philip Bohannon; Xin Luna Dong; Sumit Ganguly; Henry F Korth; Chengkai Li; PPS Narayan; Pradeep Shenoy,To achieve this; ROLEX is integrated tightly with both the DBMS and the application througha standard interface supported by most XML parsers; the Document Object Model (DOM).Thus; in general; an application need not be modified to be used with ROLEX. With theDBMS providing performance qualitatively similar to cached data; XML applications can relyon it for concurrency control and recovery services. To support our integration model andperformance goals; ROLEX is built on the DataBlitz TM Main-Memory Database System;allowing us to capitalize on low-latency access to data while still providing concurrencycontrol and recovery [1].

Discovering and learning sensational episodes of news events,Xiang Ao; Ping Luo; Chengkai Li; Fuzhen Zhuang; Qing He; Zhongzhi Shi,Abstract This paper studies the problem of discovering and learning sensational 2-episodes;ie; pairs of co-occurring news events. To find all frequent episodes; we propose an efficientalgorithm; MEELO; which significantly outperforms conventional methods. Given manyfrequent episodes; we rank them by their sensational effect. Instead of limiting ourselves toany individual subjective measure of sensational effect; we propose a learning-to-rankapproach that exploits multiple features to capture the sensational effect of an episode fromvarious aspects. An experimental study on real data verified our approach's efficiency andeffectiveness.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,2
Personalized ranking in web databases: establishing and utilizing an appropriate workload,Aditya Telang; Sharma Chakravarthy; Chengkai Li,Abstract The emergence of the deep Web has given a new connotation to the concept ofranking database query results. Earlier approaches for ranking either resorted to analyzingfrequencies of database values and query logs or establishing user profiles. In contrast; anintegrated approach; based on the notion of a similarity model; for holistically supportinguser-and query-dependent ranking has been recently proposed (Telang et al. in IEEETransactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE); 2011). An important componentof this framework is a workload consisting of ranking functions; wherein each functionrepresents an individual user's preferences towards the results of a specific query. At thetime of answering a query for which no prior ranking function exists; the similarity model isemployed; and is expected to ensure a good quality of ranking as long as a ranking …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2013,2
Cross-lingual Entity Alignment via Joint Attribute-Preserving Embedding,Zequn Sun; Wei Hu; Chengkai Li,Abstract Entity alignment is the task of finding entities in two knowledge bases (KBs) thatrepresent the same real-world object. When facing KBs in different natural languages;conventional cross-lingual entity alignment methods rely on machine translation to eliminatethe language barriers. These approaches often suffer from the uneven quality of translationsbetween languages. While recent embedding-based techniques encode entities andrelationships in KBs and do not need machine translation for cross-lingual entity alignment;a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored. In this paper; we propose ajoint attribute-preserving embedding model for cross-lingual entity alignment. It jointlyembeds the structures of two KBs into a unified vector space and further refines it byleveraging attribute correlations in the KBs.

We propose methods toproduce preview tables for compact presentation of important entity types and relationshipsin entity graphs. The preview tables assist users in attaining a quick and rough preview ofthe data. They can be shown in a limited display space for a user to browse and explore;before she decides to spend time and resources to fetch and investigate the completedataset. We formulate several optimization problems that look for previews with the highestscores according to intuitive goodness measures; under various constraints on preview sizeand distance between preview tables.

Orion: Enabling Suggestions in a Visual Query Builder for Ultra-Heterogeneous Graphs,Nandish Jayaram; Rohit Bhoopalam; Chengkai Li; Vassilis Athitsos,Abstract: The database community has long recognized the importance of graphical queryinterface to the usability of data management systems. Yet; relatively less has been done.We present Orion; a visual interface for querying ultra-heterogeneous graphs. It iterativelyassists users in query graph construction by making suggestions via machine learningmethods. In its active mode; Orion automatically suggests top-k edges to be added to aquery graph. In its passive mode; the user adds a new edge manually; and Orion suggests aranked list of labels for the edge. Orion's edge ranking algorithm; Random Decision Paths(RDP); makes use of a query log to rank candidate edges by how likely they will match theuser's query intent. Extensive user studies using Freebase demonstrated that Orion usershave a 70% success rate in constructing complex query graphs; a significant …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.06856,2016,1
On contextual ranking queries in databases,Chengkai Li,Abstract In this paper; we identify a novel and interesting type of queries; contextual rankingqueries; which return the ranks of query tuples among some context tuples given in thequeries. Contextual ranking queries are useful for olap and decision support applications innon-traditional data exploration. They provide a mechanism to quickly identify where tuplesstand within the context. In this paper; we extend the sql language to express contextualranking queries and propose a general partition-based framework for processing them. Inthis framework; we use a novel method that utilizes bitmap indices built on ranking functions.This method can efficiently identify a small number of candidate tuples; thus achieves lowercost than alternative methods. We analytically investigate the advantages and drawbacks ofthese methods; according to a preliminary cost model. Experimental results suggest that …,Information Systems,2013,1

Discovering Attribute Locality across the Deep Web: an Ordering-Based Approach,Chengkai Li; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract The large number of structured database sources on the Web presents pressingneed for information integration at a large scale. How can we enable systematic access tothis “deep Web”? We observe that; while autonomous sources are seemingly independent;their query schemas often reveal certain correlations; such that sources in the samestructured domain (eg; books; cars) tend to share a “locality” of query attributes. This paperthus develops the notion of attribute localities; which is key for many schema-basedintegration tasks–such as source clustering and query mediation. Such attribute localities;while very useful; are computational expensive to discover. However; our observation furtherindicates that the localities are often self-revealing; when attributes are linearly ordered in acertain way; reflecting their connectivities. We thus further propose a novel ordering …,*,2003,1
Continuous Monitoring of Pareto Frontiers on Partially Ordered Attributes for Many Users,Afroza Sultana; Chengkai Li,Abstract: We study the problem of continuous objects dissemination---given a large numberof users and continuously arriving new objects; deliver an object to all users who prefer theobject. Many real world applications analyze users' preferences for effective objectsdissemination. For instance; Facebook considers user's feedback in selecting news feedsinteresting to the user. For continuously arriving objects; timely finding users who prefer anew object is challenging. In this paper; we consider an append-only table of objects withmultiple attributes and users' preferences on individual attributes are modeled as strictpartial orders. An object is preferred by a user if it belongs to the Pareto frontier with respectto the user's partial orders. Users' preferences can be similar. Exploiting shared computationacross similar preferences of different users; we design algorithms to find target users of a …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.08312,2017,*
Graph Querying Meets HCI: State of the Art and Future Directions,Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Chengkai Li,Abstract Querying graph databases has emerged as an important research problem for real-world applications that center on large graph data. Given the syntactic complexity of graphquery languages (eg; SPARQL; Cypher); visual graph query interfaces make it easy for non-expert users to query such graph data repositories. In this tutorial; we survey recentdevelopments in the emerging area of visual graph querying paradigm that bridgestraditional graph querying with human computer interaction (HCI). We discuss manual anddata-driven visual graph query interfaces; various strategies and guidance for constructinggraph queries visually; interleaving processing of graph queries and visual actions; andvisual exploration of graph query results. In addition; the tutorial suggests open problemsand new research directions.

Method and apparatus for composing XSL transformations with XML publishing views,*,A method and apparatus are provided for composing XSL transformations with XMLpublishing views. XSL transformations are performed on XML documents defined as viewsof relational databases. A portion of a relational database can be exported to an XMLdocument. An initial view query defines an XML view on the relational database and anXSLT stylesheet specifies at least one transformation. The initial view query is modified toaccount for an effect of the transformation and the modified view query is applied to therelational database to obtain the XML document. When the modified view query is evaluatedon a relational database instance; the same XML document is obtained as would beobtained by evaluating the XSLT stylesheet on the original XML view.,*,2015,*
iPLUG: Personalized List Recommendation in Twitter,Lijiang Chen; Yibing Zhao; Shimin Chen; Hui Fang; Chengkai Li; Min Wang,Abstract A Twitter user can easily be overwhelmed by flooding tweets from her followees;making it challenging for the user to find interesting and useful information in tweets. Thefeature of Twitter Lists allows users to organize their followees into multiple subsets forselectively digesting tweets. However; this feature has not received wide reception becauseusers are reluctant to invest initial efforts in manually creating lists. To address the challengeof bootstrapping Twitter Lists; we envision a novel tool that automatically createspersonalized Twitter Lists and recommends them to users. Compared with lists created byreal Twitter users; the lists generated by our algorithms achieve 73.6% similarity.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2013,*
Extracting Storm-Centric Characteristics from Raw Rainfall Data for Storm Analysis and Mining,Ramez Elmasri; John McEnery; Chengkai Li,ABSTRACT Most rainfall data is stored in formats that are not easy to analyze and mine. Inthese formats; the amount of data is enormous. In this paper; we propose techniques tosummarize the raw rainfall data into a model that facilitates storm analysis and mining; andreduces the data size. The result is to convert raw rainfall data into meaningful storm-centricdata; which is then stored in a relational database for easy analysis and mining. The size ofthe storm data is less than 1% of the size of the raw data. We can determine the spatio-temporal characteristics of a storm; such as how big a storm is; how many sites are covered;and what is its overall depth (precipitation) and duration. We present formal definitions forthe storm-related concepts that are needed in our data conversion. Then we describe stormidentification algorithms based on these concepts.

Intuitive and Interactive Query Formulation to Improve the Usability of Query Systems for Heterogeneous Graphs,Nandish Jayaram; Chengkai Li; Ramez Elmasri,ABSTRACT Heterogeneous graphs are increasingly used to represent complexrelationships in schema-less data. Querying these graphs is a fundamental and critical taskfor many graph applications. While such graphs are content-rich; they are difficult to use. Inthis work we present techniques to help schema-agnostic users easily query such largeheterogeneous graphs. As an initial step towards making such graphs more usable; wepropose two systems:(1) GQBE; a system which supports a new querying paradigm thatqueries such graphs by example entity tuples; without requiring them to form complex graphqueries; and (2) VIIQ; an interactive visual query formulation system that helps usersconstruct exact query graphs.

SIGMOD 2003 Demo Proposal: Relational On-Line Exchange with XML,Philip Bohannon; Xin Luna Dong; Sumit Ganguly; Henry F Korth; Chengkai Li; PPS Narayan; Pradeep Shenoy,As XML has gained widespread popularity; new applications are often XML-based; that is;they depend primarily on XML documents and the associated data model for data accessand messaging. However; in most cases the XML-based application must interoperate withexisting SQL-based applications. In the typical “shred-and-publish” approach tointeroperation; incoming XML data is parsed (shredded) into relational tables and outgoingdata is extracted by SQL engines and then formatted (published) as XML.
