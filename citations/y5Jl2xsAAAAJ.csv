Finding Unknown Malice in 10 Seconds: Mass Vetting for New Threats at the Google-Play Scale,Kai Chen; Peng Wang; Yeonjoon Lee; XiaoFeng Wang; Nan Zhang; Heqing Huang; Wei Zou; Peng Liu,Abstract An app market's vetting process is expected to be scalable and effective. However;today's vetting mechanisms are slow and less capable of catching new threats. In ourresearch; we found that a more powerful solution can be found by exploiting the wayAndroid malware is constructed and disseminated; which is typically through repackaginglegitimate apps with similar malicious components. As a result; such attack payloads oftenstand out from those of the same repackaging origin and also show up in the apps notsupposed to relate to each other. Based upon this observation; we developed a newtechnique; called MassVet; for vetting apps at a massive scale; without knowing whatmalware looks like and how it behaves. Unlike existing detection mechanisms; which oftenutilize heavyweight program analysis techniques; our approach simply compares a …,24th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 15),2015,90
The Peril of Fragmentation: Security Hazards in Android Device Driver Customizations,Xiaoyong Zhou; Yeonjoon Lee; Nan Zhang; Muhammad Naveed; XiaoFeng Wang,Android phone manufacturers are under the perpetual pressure to move quickly on theirnew models; continuously customizing Android to fit their hardware. However; the securityimplications of this practice are less known; particularly when it comes to the changes madeto Android's Linux device drivers; eg; those for camera; GPS; NFC etc. In this paper; wereport the first study aimed at a better understanding of the security risks in thiscustomization process. Our study is based on ADDICTED; a new tool we built forautomatically detecting some types of flaws in customized driver protection. Specifically; ona customized phone; ADDICTED performs dynamic analysis to correlate the operations on asecurity-sensitive device to its related Linux files; and then determines whether those filesare under-protected on the Linux layer by comparing them with their counterparts on an …,Security and Privacy (SP); 2014 IEEE Symposium on,2014,66
Leave Me Alone: App-level Protection Against Runtime Information Gathering on Android,Nan Zhang; Kan Yuan; Muhammad Naveed; Xiaoyong Zhou; XiaoFeng Wang,Stealing of sensitive information from apps is always considered to be one of the mostcritical threats to Android security. Recent studies show that this can happen even to theapps without explicit implementation flaws; through exploiting some design weaknesses ofthe operating system; eg; Shared communication channels such as Bluetooth; and sidechannels such as memory and network-data usages. In all these attacks; a malicious appneeds to run side-by-side with the target app (the victim) to collect its runtime information.Examples include recording phone conversations from the phone app; gathering WebMD'sdata usages to infer the disease condition the user looks at; etc. This runtime-information-gathering (RIG) threat is realistic and serious; as demonstrated by prior research and ournew findings; which reveal that the malware monitoring popular Android-based home …,Security and Privacy (SP); 2015 IEEE Symposium on,2015,37
Hare Hunting in the Wild Android: A Study on the Threat of Hanging Attribute References,Nan Zhang; Yousra Aafer; Zhongwen Zhang; Xiao Zhang; Kai Chen; XiaoFeng Wang; Xiaoyong Zhou; Wenliang Du; Michael Grace,Abstract Android is characterized by the complicated relations among its components andapps; through which one party interacts with the other (eg; starting its activity) by referring toits attributes like package; activity; service; action names; authorities and permissions. Suchrelations can be easily compromised during a customization: eg; when an app is removed tofit an Android version to a new device model; while references to the app remain inside thatOS. This conflict between the decentralized; unregulated Android customization process andthe interdependency among different Android components and apps leads to thepervasiveness of hanging attribute references (Hares); a type of vulnerabilities neverinvestigated before. In our research; we show that popular Android devices are riddled withsuch flaws; which often have serious security implications: when an attribute (eg; a …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,25
Modeling and Analysis of Bifurcation in a Delayed Worm Propagation Model,Yu Yao; Nan Zhang; Wenlong Xiang; Ge Yu; Fuxiang Gao,A delayed worm propagation model with birth and death rates is formulated. The stability ofthe positive equilibrium is studied. Through theoretical analysis; a critical value of Hopfbifurcation is derived. The worm propagation system is locally asymptotically stable whentime delay is less than. However; Hopf bifurcation appears when time delay passes thethreshold; which means that the worm propagation system is unstable and out of control.Consequently; time delay should be adjusted to be less than to ensure the stability of thesystem stable and better prediction of the scale and speed of Internet worm spreading.Finally; numerical and simulation experiments are presented to simulate the system; whichfully support our analysis.,Journal of Applied Mathematics,2013,8
Staying Secure and Unprepared: Understanding and Mitigating the Security Risks of Apple ZeroConf,Xiaolong Bai; Luyi Xing; Nan Zhang; XiaoFeng Wang; Xiaojing Liao; Tongxin Li; Shi-Min Hu,With the popularity of today's usability-oriented designs; dubbed Zero Configuration orZeroConf; unclear are the security implications of these automatic service discovery;" plug-and-play" techniques. In this paper; we report the first systematic study on this issue;focusing on the security features of the systems related to Apple; the major proponent ofZeroConf techniques. Our research brings to light a disturbing lack of security considerationin these systems' designs: major ZeroConf frameworks on the Apple platforms; including theCore Bluetooth Framework; Multipeer Connectivity and Bonjour; are mostly unprotected andpopular apps and system services; such as Tencent QQ; Apple Handoff; printer discoveryand AirDrop; turn out to be completely vulnerable to an impersonation or Man-in-the-Middle(MitM) attack; even though attempts have been made to protect them against such threats …,Security and Privacy (SP); 2016 IEEE Symposium on,2016,6
Picking Up My Tab: Understanding and Mitigating Synchronized Token Lifting and Spending in Mobile Payment,Xiaolong Bai; Zhe Zhou; XiaoFeng Wang; Zhou Li; Xianghang Mi; Nan Zhang; Tongxin Li; Shi-Min Hu; Kehuan Zhang,Abstract Mobile off-line payment enables purchase over the counter even in the absence ofreliable network connections. Popular solutions proposed by leading payment serviceproviders (eg; Google; Amazon; Samsung; Apple) rely on direct communication between thepayer's device and the POS system; through Near-Field Communication (NFC); MagneticSecure Transaction (MST); audio and QR code. Although pre-cautions have been taken toprotect the payment transactions through these channels; their security implications are lessunderstood; particularly in the presence of unique threats to this new e-commerce service. Inthe paper; we report a new type of over-the-counter payment frauds on mobile off-linepayment; which exploit the designs of existing schemes that apparently fail to consider theadversary capable of actively affecting the payment process.

HanGuard: SDN-driven protection of smart home WiFi devices from malicious mobile apps,Soteris Demetriou; Nan Zhang; Yeonjoon Lee; XiaoFeng Wang; Carl A Gunter; Xiaoyong Zhou; Michael Grace,Abstract A new development of smart-home systems is to use mobile apps to control IoTdevices across a Home Area Network (HAN). As verified in our study; those systems tend torely on the Wi-Fi router to authenticate other devices. This treatment exposes them to theattack from malicious apps; particularly those running on authorized phones; which therouter does not have information to control. Mitigating this threat cannot solely rely on IoTmanufacturers; which may need to change the hardware on the devices to supportencryption; increasing the cost of the device; or software developers who we need to trust toimplement security correctly. In this work; we present a new technique to control thecommunication between the IoT devices and their apps in a unified; backward-compatibleway. Our approach; called HanGuard; does not require any changes to the IoT devices …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks,2017,1
Ghost Installer in the Shadow: Security Analysis of App Installation on Android,Yeonjoon Lee; Tongxin Li; Nan Zhang; Soteris Demetriou; Mingming Zha; XiaoFeng Wang; Kai Chen; Xiaoyong Zhou; Xinhui Han; Michael Grace,Android allows developers to build apps with app installation functionality themselves withminimal restriction and support like any other functionalities. Given the critical importance ofapp installation; the security implications of the approach can be significant. This paperreports the first systematic study on this issue; focusing on the security guarantees ofdifferent steps of the App Installation Transaction (AIT). We demonstrate the seriousconsequences of leaving AIT development to individual developers: most installers (eg;Amazon AppStore; DTIgnite; Baidu) are riddled with various security-critical loopholes;which can be exploited by attackers to silently install any apps; acquiring dangerous-levelpermissions or even unauthorized access to system resources. Surprisingly; vulnerabilitieswere found in all steps of AIT.

Unfortunately; the excitingutility and rapid marketization of IoT; come at the expense of privacy and security. Industryreports and academic work have revealed many attacks on IoT systems; resulting in privacyleakage; property loss and large-scale availability problems. To mitigate such threats; a fewsolutions have been proposed. However; it is still less clear what are the impacts they canhave on the IoT ecosystem. In this work; we aim to perform a comprehensive study onreported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming to find out what we know; where thecurrent studies fall short and how to move forward. To this end; we first build a toolkit thatsearches through massive amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.09809,2017,1
Unleashing the Walking Dead: Understanding Cross-App Remote Infections on Mobile WebViews,Tongxin Li; Xueqiang Wang; Mingming Zha; Kai Chen; XiaoFeng Wang; Luyi Xing; Xiaolong Bai; Nan Zhang; Xinhui Han,Abstract As a critical feature for enhancing user experience; cross-app URL invocation hasbeen reported to cause unauthorized execution of app components. Although protection hasalready been put in place; little has been done to understand the security risks of navigatingan app's WebView through an URL; a legitimate need for displaying the app's UI duringcross-app interactions. In our research; we found that the current design of such cross-WebView navigation actually opens the door to a cross-app remote infection; allowing aremote adversary to spread malicious web content across different apps' WebViewinstances and acquire stealthy and persistent control of these apps. This new threat; dubbedCross-App WebView Infection (XAWI); enables a series of multi-app; colluding attacks neverthought before; with significant real world impacts. Particularly; we found that the remote …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2017,*
SmartAuth: User-Centered Authorization for the Internet of Things,Yuan Tian; Nan Zhang; Yueh-Hsun Lin; XiaoFeng Wang; Blase Ur; XianZheng Guo; Patrick Tague,Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) platforms often require users to grant permissions to third-party apps; such as the ability to control a lock. Unfortunately; because few users act basedupon; or even comprehend; permission screens; malicious or careless apps can becomeoverprivileged by requesting unneeded permissions. To meet the IoT's unique securitydemands; such as cross-device; context-based; and automatic operations; we present a newdesign that supports user-centric; semantic-based “smart” authorization. Our technique;called SmartAuth; automatically collects security-relevant information from an IoT app'sdescription; code and annotations; and generates an authorization user interface to bridgethe gap between the functionalities explained to the user and the operations the app actuallyperforms. Through the interface; security policies can be generated and enforced by …,26th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 17),2017,*

Bifurcation in a Delayed Worm Propagation Model with Birth and Death Rates,Yu Yao; Nan Zhang; Fu-Xiang Gao; Ge Yu,In this paper; a delayed worm propagation model with birth and death rates is discussed.The number of system reinstallations may be increased when the hosts get unstable(infected or quarantined). In view of such situation; dynamic birth and death rates areintroduced. Afterwards; the stability of the positive equilibrium is studied. Through thetheoretical analysis; it is proved that the model is locally asymptotically stable without timedelay. Moreover; a bifurcation appears when time delay t passes a constant value whichmeans that the worm propagation system is unstable and uncontrollable. Thus; the timedelay should be decreased in order to predict or eliminate the worm propagation. Finally; anumeric simulation is presented which fully supports our analysis.,Systems and Informatics (ICSAI); 2012 International Conference on,2012,*
