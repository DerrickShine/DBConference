A survey on representation; composition and application of preferences in database systems,Kostas Stefanidis; Georgia Koutrika; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Preferences have been traditionally studied in philosophy; psychology; andeconomics and applied to decision making problems. Recently; they have attracted theattention of researchers in other fields; such as databases where they capture soft criteria forqueries. Databases bring a whole fresh perspective to the study of preferences; bothcomputational and representational. From a representational perspective; the centralquestion is how we can effectively represent preferences and incorporate them in databasequerying. From a computational perspective; we can look at how we can efficiently processpreferences in the context of database queries. Several approaches have been proposedbut a systematic study of these works is missing. The purpose of this survey is to provide aframework for placing existing works in perspective and highlight critical open challenges …,ACM Trans. Database Syst,2011,140
Adding context to preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available; personalizationsystems allow users to specify the information that interests them through preferences. Mostoften; users have different preferences depending on context. In this paper; we introduce amodel for expressing such contextual preferences. Context is modeled as a set ofmultidimensional attributes. We formulate the context resolution problem as the problem of(a) identifying those preferences that qualify to encompass the context state of a query and(b) selecting the most appropriate among them. We also propose an algorithm for contextresolution that uses a data structure; called the profile tree; that indexes preferences basedon their associated context. Finally; we evaluate our approach from two perspectives:usability and performance.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,106
“You May Also Like” Results in Relational Databases,Kostas Stefanidis; Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,ABSTRACT In this position paper; we consider extending relational database systems with arecommendation functionality. In particular; we propose that; along with the results of eachquery; the user gets additional recommended results that we call “You May Also Like” orYmal results. We discuss a suite of different approaches to computing Ymal results andexploit one that uses only the database content and the query results. Some preliminaryevaluation results are also provided.,Proc. PersDB; Lyon; France,2009,66
Fast group recommendations by applying user clustering,Eirini Ntoutsi; Kostas Stefanidis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Recommendation systems have received significant attention; with most of theproposed methods focusing on personal recommendations. However; there are contexts inwhich the items to be suggested are not intended for a single user but for a group of people.For example; assume a group of friends or a family that is planning to watch a movie or visita restaurant. In this paper; we propose an extensive model for group recommendations thatexploits recommendations for items that similar users to the group members liked in the past.We do not exhaustively search for similar users in the whole user base; but we pre-partitionusers into clusters of similar ones and use the cluster members for recommendations. Weefficiently aggregate the single user recommendations into group recommendations byleveraging the power of a top-k algorithm. We evaluate our approach in a real dataset of …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,55
Fast contextual preference scoring of database tuples,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract To provide users with only relevant data from the huge amount of availableinformation; personalization systems utilize preferences to allow users to express theirinterest on specific pieces of data. Most often; user preferences vary depending on thecircumstances. For instance; when with friends; users may like to watch thrillers; whereas;when with their kids; they may prefer to watch cartoons. Contextual preference systemsaddress this challenge by supporting preferences that depend on the values of contextualattributes such as the surrounding environment; time or location. In this paper; we addressthe problem of finding interesting data items based on contextual preferences that assigninterest scores to pieces of data based on context. To this end; we propose a number of pre-processing steps. Instead of pre-computing scores for all data items under all potential …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,47
PerK: personalized keyword search in relational databases through preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Keyword-based search in relational databases allows users to discover relevantinformation without knowing the database schema or using complicated queries. However;such searches may return an overwhelming number of results; often loosely related to theuser intent. In this paper; we propose personalizing keyword database search by utilizinguser preferences. Query results are ranked based on both their relevance to the query andtheir preference degree for the user. To further increase the quality of results; we considertwo new metrics that evaluate the goodness of the result as a set; namely coverage of manyuser interests and content diversity. We present an algorithm for processing preferencequeries that uses the preferential order between keywords to direct the joining of relevanttuples from multiple relations. We then show how to reduce the complexity of this …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,46
Preference-aware publish/subscribe delivery with diversity,Marina Drosou; Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In publish/subscribe systems; users describe their interests via subscriptions andare notified whenever new interesting events become available. Typically; in such systems;all subscriptions are considered equally important. However; due to the abundance ofinformation; users may receive overwhelming amounts of events. In this paper; we proposeusing a ranking mechanism based on user preferences; so that only top-ranked events aredelivered to each user. Since many times top-ranked events are similar to each other; wealso propose increasing the diversity of delivered events. Furthermore; we examine anumber of different delivering policies for forwarding ranked events to users; namely aperiodic; a sliding-window and a history-based one. We have fully implemented ourapproach in SIENA; a popular publish/subscribe middleware system; and report …,Proceedings of the Third ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2009,42
Entity resolution in the web of data,Vassilis Christophides; Vasilis Efthymiou; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract In recent years; several knowledge bases have been built to enable large-scaleknowledge sharing; but also an entity-centric Web search; mixing both structured data andtext querying. These knowledge bases offer machine-readable descriptions of real-worldentities; eg; persons; places; published on the Web as Linked Data. However; due to thedifferent information extraction tools and curation policies employed by knowledge bases;multiple; complementary and sometimes conflicting descriptions of the same real-worldentities may be provided. Entity resolution aims to identify different descriptions that refer tothe same entity appearing either within or across knowledge bases. The objective of thisbook is to present the new entity resolution challenges stemming from the openness of theWeb of data in describing entities by an unbounded number of knowledge bases; the …,Synthesis Lectures on the Semantic Web,2015,40
Nearest keyword search in XML documents,Yufei Tao; Stavros Papadopoulos; Cheng Sheng; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract This paper studies the nearest keyword (NK) problem on XML documents. Ingeneral; the dataset is a tree where each node is associated with one or more keywords.Given a node q and a keyword w; an NK query returns the node that is nearest to q amongall the nodes associated with w. NK search is not only useful as a stand-alone operator butalso as a building brick for important tasks such as XPath query evaluation and keywordsearch. We present an indexing scheme that answers NK queries efficiently; in terms of bothpractical and worst-case performance. The query cost is provably logarithmic to the numberof nodes carrying the query keyword. The proposed scheme occupies space linear to thedataset size; and can be constructed by a fast algorithm. Extensive experimentation confirmsour theoretical findings; and demonstrates the effectiveness of NK retrieval as a primitive …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,35
A context-aware preference database system,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Purpose–A context-aware system is a system that uses context to provide relevantinformation or services to its users.

Modeling and storing context-aware preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract Today; the overwhelming volume of information that is available to an increasinglywider spectrum of users creates the need for personalization. In this paper; we consider adatabase system that supports context-aware preference queries; that is; preference querieswhose result depends on the context at the time of their submission. We use data cubes tostore the associations between context-dependent preferences and database relations andOLAP techniques for processing context-aware queries; thus allowing the manipulation ofthe captured context data at different levels of abstractions. To improve query performance;we use an auxiliary data structure; called context tree; which indexes the results ofpreviously computed preference-aware queries based on their associated context. We showhow these cached results can be used to process both exact and approximate context …,Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2006,31
Managing contextual preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available;personalization systems allow users to specify through preferences which pieces of datainterest them. Most often; users have different preferences depending on context. In thispaper; we introduce a model for expressing such contextual preferences. Context ismodeled using a set of hierarchical attributes; thus allowing context specification at variouslevels of detail. We formulate the context resolution problem as the problem of selectingappropriate preferences based on context for personalizing a query. We also proposealgorithms for context resolution based on data structures that index preferences byexploiting the hierarchical nature of the context attributes.

We enhance recommendations withthe notion of support to model the confidence of the recommendations. Moreover; wepropose partitioning users into clusters of similar ones. This way; recommendations for usersare produced with respect to the preferences of their cluster members without extensivelysearching for similar users in the whole user base. Finally; we leverage the power of a top-kalgorithm for locating the top-k group recommendations.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,26
Parallel meta-blocking: Realizing scalable entity resolution over large; heterogeneous data,Vasilis Efthymiou; George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Kostas Stefanidis; Themis Palpanas,Entity resolution constitutes a crucial task for many applications; but has an inherentlyquadratic complexity. Typically; it scales to large volumes of data through blocking: similarentities are clustered into blocks so that it suffices to perform comparisons only within eachblock. Meta-blocking further increases efficiency by cleaning the overlapping blocks fromunnecessary comparisons. However; even Meta-blocking can be time-consuming: applyingit to blocks with 7.4 million entities and 2.21011 comparisons takes almost 8 days on amodern high-end server. In this paper; we parallelize Meta-blocking based on MapReduce.We propose a simple strategy that explicitly creates the core concept of Meta-blocking; theblocking graph. We then describe an advanced strategy that creates the blocking graphimplicitly; reducing the overhead of data exchange. We also introduce a load balancing …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,21
On designing archiving policies for evolving RDF datasets on the Web,Kostas Stefanidis; Ioannis Chrysakis; Giorgos Flouris,Abstract When dealing with dynamically evolving datasets; users are often interested in thestate of affairs on previous versions of the dataset; and would like to execute queries onsuch previous versions; as well as queries that compare the state of affairs across differentversions. This is especially true for datasets stored in the Web; where the interlinking aspect;combined with the lack of central control; do not allow synchronized evolution of interlinkeddatasets. To address this requirement the obvious solution is to store all previous versions;but this could quickly increase the space requirements; an alternative solution is to storeadequate deltas between versions; which are generally smaller; but this would create theoverhead of generating versions at query time. This paper studies the trade-offs involved inthese approaches; in the context of archiving dynamic RDF datasets over the Web. Our …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2014,21
A flexible framework for understanding the dynamics of evolving RDF datasets,Yannis Roussakis; Ioannis Chrysakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Giorgos Flouris; Yannis Stavrakas,Abstract The dynamic nature of Web data gives rise to a multitude of problems related to thedescription and analysis of the evolution of RDF datasets; which are important to a largenumber of users and domains; such as; the curators of biological information where changesare constant and interrelated. In this paper; we propose a framework that enablesidentifying; analysing and understanding these dynamics. Our approach is flexible enoughto capture the peculiarities and needs of different applications on dynamic data; while beingformally robust due to the satisfaction of the completeness and unambiguity properties. Inaddition; our framework allows the persistent representation of the detected changesbetween versions; in a manner that enables easy and efficient navigation among versions;automated processing and analysis of changes; cross-snapshot queries (spanning …,International Semantic Web Conference,2015,20
Contextual recommendations for groups,Kostas Stefanidis; Nafiseh Shabib; Kjetil Nørvåg; John Krogstie,Abstract Recommendation systems have received significant attention; with most of theproposed methods focusing on recommendations for single users. Recently; there are alsoapproaches aiming at either group or context-aware recommendations. In this paper; weaddress the problem of contextual recommendations for groups. We exploit a hierarchicalcontext model to extend a typical recommendation model to a general context-aware onethat tackles the information needs of a group. We base the computation of contextual grouprecommendations on a subset of preferences of the users that present the most similarbehavior to the group; that is; the users with the most similar preferences to the preferencesof the group members; for a specific context. This subset of preferences includes the oneswith context equal to or more general than the given context.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,20

A context-aware system is a system that uses context to provide relevantinformation or services to its users. While there has been a variety of context middlewareinfrastructures and context-aware applications; little work has been done in integratingcontext into database management systems.

In this article; we focus onenhancing preferences with context. Context may express conditions on situations externalto the database or related to the data stored in the database. We outline models forexpressing both types of preferences. Then; given a user query and its surrounding context;we consider the problem of selecting related preferences to personalize the query.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2011,16

On relaxing contextual preference queries,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Personalization systems exploit preferences for providing users with only relevant data fromthe huge volume of information that is currently available. We consider preferences thatdependent on context; such as the location of the user. We model context as a set ofattributes; each taking values from hierarchical domains. Often; the context of the query maybe too specific to match any of the given preferences. In this paper; we consider possibleexpansions of the query context produced by relaxing one or more of its context attributes. Ahierarchical attribute may be relaxed upwards by replacing its value by a more general one;downwards by replacing its value by a set of more specific values or sideways by replacingits value by sibling values in the hierarchy.

Parallel meta-blocking for scaling entity resolution over big heterogeneous data,Vasilis Efthymiou; George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Kostas Stefanidis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Entity resolution constitutes a crucial task for many applications; but has aninherently quadratic complexity. In order to enable entity resolution to scale to large volumesof data; blocking is typically employed: it clusters similar entities into (overlapping) blocks sothat it suffices to perform comparisons only within each block. To further increase efficiency;Meta-blocking is being used to clean the overlapping blocks from unnecessarycomparisons; increasing precision by orders of magnitude at a small cost in recall. Despiteits high time efficiency though; using Meta-blocking in practice to solve entity resolutionproblem on very large datasets is still challenging: applying it to 7.4 million entities takes(almost) 8 full days on a modern high-end server. In this paper; we introduce scalablealgorithms for Meta-blocking; exploiting the MapReduce framework. Specifically; we …,Information Systems,2017,13
A framework for modeling; computing and presenting time-aware recommendations,Kostas Stefanidis; Eirini Ntoutsi; Mihalis Petropoulos; Kjetil Nørvåg; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Lately; recommendation systems have received significant attention. Most existingapproaches though; recommend items of potential interest to users by completely ignoringthe temporal aspects of ratings. In this paper; we argue that time-aware recommendationsneed to be pushed in the foreground. We introduce an extensive model for time-awarerecommendations from two perspectives. From a fresh-based perspective; we propose usingdifferent aging schemes for decreasing the effect of historical ratings and increasing theinfluence of fresh and novel ratings. From a context-based perspective; we focus onproviding different suggestions under different temporal specifications.

Scanning the whole database for locating similar users; though; isexpensive. Existing approaches build cluster models by employing full-dimensionalclustering to find sets of similar users. As the datasets we deal with are high-dimensionaland incomplete; full-dimensional clustering is not the best option. To this end; we explore thefault-tolerant subspace clustering approach.

Big Data Entity Resolution: From Highly to Somehow Similar Entity Descriptions in the Web,Vasilis Efthymiou; Kostas Stefanidis; Vassilis Christophides,In the Web of data; entities are described by interlinked data rather than documents on theWeb. In this work; we focus on entity resolution in the Web of data; ie; identifying descriptionsthat refer to the same real-world entity. To reduce the required number of pairwisecomparisons; methods for entity resolution perform blocking as a pre-processing step. Ablocking technique places similar entity descriptions into blocks and executes comparisonsonly between descriptions within the same block. We experimentally evaluate blockingtechniques proposed for the Web of data and present dataset characteristics that determinethe effectiveness and efficiency of such methods. Furthermore; we analyze thecharacteristics of the missed matching entity descriptions and examine different types oflinks that blocking techniques can potentially identify.,2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2015),2015,10
Preferential publish/subscribe,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Stefanidis,ABSTRACT In publish/subscribe systems; subscribers express their interests in specificevents and get notified about all published events that match their interests. As the amountof information generated increases rapidly; to control the amount of data delivered to users;we propose enhancing publish/subscribe systems with a ranking mechanism; so that onlythe top-ranked matching events are delivered. Ranking is based on letting users expresstheir preferences on events by ordering the associated subscriptions. To avoid the blockingof new notifications by top-ranked old ones; we associate with each notification an expirationtime. We have fully implemented our approach in SIENA; a popular publish/subscribemiddleware system.,Proceeding of the 2nd International Workshop on Personalized Access; Profile Management and Context Awareness: Databases (PersDB 2008); in conjunction with the VLDB 2008 Conference,2008,9

However; scanning the whole database of users for locating similar users isexpensive. Existing approaches build user profiles by employing full-dimensional clusteringto find sets of similar users. As the datasets we deal with are high-dimensional andincomplete; full-dimensional clustering is not the best option. To this end; we explore thefault tolerance subspace clustering approach that detects clusters of similar users insubspaces of the original feature space and also allows for missing values. Our experimentson real movie datasets show that the diversification of the similar users through subspaceclustering results in better recommendations comparing to traditional collaborative filteringand full dimensional clustering approaches.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,7
Preference-based query personalization,Georgia Koutrika; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract In the context of database queries; computational methods for handling preferencescan be broadly divided into two categories. Query personalization methods consider thatuser preferences are provided as a user profile separately from the query and dynamicallydetermine how this profile will affect the query results. On the other hand; preferential queryanswering methods consider that preferences are explicitly expressed within queries. Thefocus of this chapter is on query personalization methods. We will first describe howpreferences can be represented and stored in user profiles. Then; we will discuss howpreferences are selected from a user profile and applied to a query.,*,2013,7
Enabling social search in time through graphs,Kostas Stefanidis; Georgia Koloniari,Abstract Recently; social networks have attracted considerable attention. The huge volumeof information contained in them; as well as their dynamic nature; make the problem ofsearching social data challenging. In this work; we envision the design of a completeframework for social search by exploiting both the underlying social graph and the temporalinformation available in social networks. To encompass the numerous search needs; ourframework includes a time-aware graph and query model. To deploy the proposed querymodel over any social network; we define a logical algebra that provides a set of operatorsrequired for query evaluation; and for supporting a ranking functionality. We conclude bypresenting SQTime; a prototype that implements our framework.,Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation Retrieval & Reasoning,2014,6

However; as the volumeof data being created increases; some form of ranking of matched events is needed to avoidoverwhelming the users.

Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify descriptions of the same real-world entitywithin one or across knowledge bases in the Web of data. To reduce the required number ofpairwise comparisons among descriptions; ER methods typically perform a pre-processingstep; called blocking; which places similar entity descriptions into blocks and thus onlycompare descriptions within the same block.

Understanding Ontology Evolution Beyond Deltas.,Georgia Troullinou; Giannis Roussakis; Haridimos Kondylakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Giorgos Flouris,ABSTRACT The dynamic nature of the data on the Web gives rise to a multitude of problemsrelated to the description and analysis of the evolution of such data. Traditional approachesfor identifying and analyzing changes are descriptive; focusing on the provision of a “delta”that describes the changes and often overwhelming the user with loads of information. Here;we take an alternative approach which aims at giving a high-level overview of the changeprocess and at identifying the most important changes in the ontology. For doing so; weconsider different metrics of “change intensity”; taking into account the changes that affectedeach class and its neighborhood; as well as ontological information related to theimportance and connectivity of each class in the different versions. We argue that thisapproach will allow a better understanding of the intent (rather than the actions) of the …,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2016,4
D2V: A Tool for Defining; Detecting and Visualizing Changes on the Data Web.,Yannis Roussakis; Ioannis Chrysakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Giorgos Flouris,Abstract. The dynamic nature of Web data gives rise to the need of understanding andanalyzing the dynamics of individual datasets. As a matter of fact; the value of a dynamicdataset lies not only in its content; but also in its evolution history; which in someapplications (eg; trend analysis and identification); is more important than the data itself. Inthis paper; we present D2V; a tool that assists users in analyzing and visualizing theevolution history of dynamic RDF datasets. D2V is a flexible and powerful tool for defining;representing; detecting and presenting custom changes between datasets versions. Wetreat changes as first-class citizens; in a way that supports different modes of navigation onthe deltas between any pair of versions; as well as the visualization of the evolution historyof a given dataset. 1,International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos),2015,4
Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web.,Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Kostas Stefanidis,The traditional way a user interacts with a database system is through queries. Structuredquery languages; such as SQL for relational data; XQuery for XML; and SPARQL for RDFdata; allow users to submit queries that may precisely capture their information needs; butusers need to be familiar with the underlying ontology and data structure and of course thequery language itself. Moreover; users need to some extent be familiar with the content ofthe database and have a clear understanding of their information needs. Theserequirements stand as the weaknesses of this interaction mode. As data stored in databasesgrows in unprecedented rates and becomes accessible to diverse and less technicallyoriented audience; new forms of data exploration and interaction become increasingly moreattractive. The World Wide Web represents the largest and arguably the most complex …,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2014,4

A flexible framework for defining; representing and detecting changes on the data web,Yannis Roussakis; Ioannis Chrysakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Giorgos Flouris; Yannis Stavrakas,Abstract: The dynamic nature of Web data gives rise to a multitude of problems related to theidentification; computation and management of the evolving versions and the relatedchanges. In this paper; we consider the problem of change recognition in RDF datasets; ie;the problem of identifying; and when possible give semantics to; the changes that led fromone version of an RDF dataset to another. Despite our RDF focus; our approach issufficiently general to engulf different data models that can be encoded in RDF; such asrelational or multi-dimensional. In fact; we propose a flexible; extendible and data-model-independent methodology of defining changes that can capture the peculiarities and needsof different data models and applications; while being formally robust due to the satisfactionof the properties of completeness and unambiguity. Further; we propose an ontology of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1501.02652,2015,3
Report on the first international workshop on exploratory search in databases and the web (exploredb 2014),Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Kostas Stefanidis,Databases are well-organized collections of data. Structured query languages; such as SQL;XQuery; and SPARQL; enable users to formulate precise queries over the data stored in adatabase. To be successful; users need to be familiar with the query language and theunderlying data organization. They also need to understand; to some extent; the data stored;and have a fairly clear idea of what they are looking for. In contrast; the World Wide Webrepresents the largest and arguably the most complex repository of content; where theabove assumptions do not hold.

Approximate contextual preference scoring in digital libraries,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract The increasing availability of a wide variety of digital libraries provides aheterogeneous population of users with access to a heterogeneous collection of data. Tohelp users find interesting items from this huge volume of available information;personalization systems allow users to directly or indirectly indicate preferences. Suchpreferences may depend on context; for instance; on the device used to access information.In this paper; we consider a preference model that allows users to assign interest scores topieces of data based on context. We address the problem of locating interesting data itemsefficiently by exploiting some form of precomputation. To this end; instead of computingscores for all data items in all potential context states; we exploit the hierarchical nature ofcontext attributes to identify representative context states and compute scores for them …,Proc. of Workshop on Personalized Access; Profile Management; and Context Awareness in Digital Libraries (PersDL),2007,2

Simplifying Entity Resolution on Web Data with Schema-agnostic; Non-iterative Matching,Vasilis Efthymiou; George Papadakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Vassilis Christophides,Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify different descriptions in various Knowledge Bases(KBs) that refer to the same entity. ER is challenged by the Variety; Volume and Veracity ofdescriptions published in the Web of Data. To address them; we propose the MinoanERframework that fulfills full automation and support of highly heterogeneous entities.MinoanER leverages a token-based similarity of entities to define a new metric that derivesthe similarity of neighboring entities from the most important relations; indicated only bystatistics. For high efficiency; similarities are computed from a set of schema-agnostic blocksand processed in a non-iterative way that involves four threshold-free heuristics.

In that way; the field of recommender systems has beenevolving vastly to match the increasing user needs accordingly. News; products; ideas andpeople are only a few of the things that we can be recommended with daily. However; evenwith the many years of research; several areas still remain unexplored. The focus of thispaper revolves around such an area; namely on how to achieve diversity in single-user andgroup recommendations. Specifically; we decouple diversity from strictly revolving arounditems; and consider it as an orthogonal dimension that can be incorporated independently atdifferent times in the recommender's workflow.

Group Recommendations in MapReduce,Vasilis Efthymiou; Petros Zervoudakis; Kostas Stefanidis; Dimitris Plexousakis,Abstract Recommender systems have received significant attention; with most of theproposed methods focusing on recommendations for single users.

For example; assume a group of friends or a family that is planning to watch a movieor visit a restaurant. In this paper; we propose an extensive model for grouprecommendations that exploits recommendations for items that similar users to the groupmembers liked in the past. We follow two different approaches for offering recommendationsto the members of a group: considering the members of a group as a single user; andrecommending to this user items that similar users liked; or estimating first how much eachgroup member would like an item; and then; recommend the items that would (dis) satisfy …,*,2017,*

Inconsistency management based on relevance degrees,Anna Zamansky1 Ofer Arieli; Kostas Stefanidis,Inconsistency handling in constrained databases is a primary issue in the context ofconsistent query answering; data integration; and data exchange. The standard approachesto this issue are usually based on the principle of minimal change; aspiring to achieveconsistency via a minimal amount of data modifications (see; eg;[2; 6; 7]). A key question inthis respect is how to choose among the different possibilities of restoring the consistency of('repairing') a database. Earlier approaches to inconsistency management were based onthe assumption that there should be some fixed; pre-determined way of repairing adatabase. Recently; there has been a paradigm shift towards user-controlled inconsistencymanagement policies.

NK search is not only useful as a standalone operator butalso as a building brick for important tasks such as XPath query evaluation and keywordsearch. We present an indexing scheme that answers NK queries efficiently; in terms of bothpractical and worst-case performance. The query cost is provably logarithmic to the numberof nodes carrying the query keyword. The proposed scheme occupies space linear to thedataset size; and can be constructed by a fast algorithm.

The decentralized and distributed nature of p2psystems leads to living aside the client-server model. In p2p model each node takes both theroles of client and server. As a client; it can query and download its wanted data files fromother nodes and as a server; it can provide data files to other nodes. Two main objectives inp2p systems are data location and search for interesting data. In order to present thesetopics; we survey various structured and unstructured p2p systems. We also study content-based p2p systems that are systems with clusters of nodes; according to the content of theirdata files.

Schema-agnostic Blocking for Entity Resolution over Noisy Heterogeneous Data,Tiago Brasileiro Araújo; Carlos Eduardo Santos Pires; Demetrio Gomes; Thiago Pereira da Nóbrega Mestre; Dimas Cassimiro do Nascimento; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract. The increasing use of Web systems (eg; digital libraries; social networks; and e-commerce) has become a valuable source of semistructured data. In this context; the EntityResolution task emerges as a fundamental step to integrate multiple knowledge bases oridentify similarities between the data (ie; entities). Usually; blocking techniques are widelyapplied as the initial step of Entity Resolution approaches in order to avoid computing thecomparisons between all pairs of entities (quadratic cost). In practice; heterogeneous andnoisy data increase the difficulties faced by blocking techniques. To address thesechallenges; we proposed the NA-BLOCKER technique; which is capable of tolerating noisydata to extract information regarding the schema and generate high-quality blocks (ie;blocks that contain only entities with high chances of being considered correspondents) …,*,*,*

The prerequisite for determining suchrecommendations is information on the users' interests; eg; the users' purchasehistory.Recently; big data poses several new challenges for computing recommendations;such as the need for quick understanding and consuming data; as well as the need for …,*,*,*

Preference-Driven Keyword Search in Relational Databases,Kostas Stefanidis; Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Keyword-based search in relational databases allows users to discover relevant informationwithout knowing the database schema or using complicated queries. However; such searchesmay return an overwhelming number of results. In this paper; we propose personalizing keyworddatabase search by allowing users to express preferences. User preferences depend oncontext. Given the context of a keyword query; the related preferences are selected and usedto rank the results. We present an algorithm for incorporating preferences in computing thetop-k most pertinent to the user results. The algorithm uses the keyword appearances in the preferencesto direct the joining of relevant tuples from multiple relations. We then extend this baseline algorithmto: (i) enhance the diversity of its results and (ii) improve its performance by sharing computationalsteps. Finally; we report results of an evaluation of our approach along two perspectives …,*,*,*
Preference Queries in Context,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,ABSTRACT To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available;personalization systems allow users to specify the information that interests them throughpreferences. In general; users may have different preferences depending on context; forinstance; on the current weather; time or location. In this paper; we define a model forexpressing contextual preferences. We model context as an ordered set of multidimensionalattributes. Then; user preferences can be specified as functions over these context attributes.We formulate the problem of identifying the preferences that are most relevant to a queryand present an algorithm that locates them. We also introduce index structures that exploitcontextual information for (a) storing preferences and (b) caching the results of queriesbased on their context.,*,*,*
Preference Modeling and Orders,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,The purpose of this paper is to present fundamental notions of preference modeling. Ingeneral; the research literature on preferences is extensive. In the context of databasequeries; there are two different approaches for expressing preferences: a qualitative and aquantitative one. In the qualitative approach [1–3]; the preferences between the tuples in theanswer to a query are specified directly; typically using binary preference relations. In thequantitative approach [4–7]; preferences are expressed indirectly by using scoring functionsthat associate a numeric score with every tuple of the query answer. Then; a tuple t1 ispreferred to a tuple t2 if and only if the score of t1 is higher than the score of t2. In the rest ofthe paper; we explain all our rigorous definitions with examples that refer to a Moviesrelation. In particular; we shall use the relation,*,*,*
