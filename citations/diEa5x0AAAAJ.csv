Optimal finger search trees in the pointer machine,Gerth Stølting Brodal; George Lagogiannis; Christos Makris; Athanasios Tsakalidis; Kostas Tsichlas,Abstract We develop a new finger search tree with worst-case constant update time in thepointer machine (PM) model of computation. This was a major problem in the field of DataStructures and was tantalizingly open for over 20 years; while many attempts by researcherswere made to solve it. The result comes as a consequence of the innovative mechanism thatguides the rebalancing operations; combined with incremental multiple splitting and fusiontechniques over nodes.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,40
Strict fibonacci heaps,Gerth Stølting Brodal; George Lagogiannis; Robert E Tarjan,Abstract We present the first pointer-based heap implementation with time bounds matchingthose of Fibonacci heaps in the worst case. We support make-heap; insert; find-min; meldand decrease-key in worst-case O (1) time; and delete and delete-min in worst-case O (lg n)time; where n is the size of the heap. The data structure uses linear space. A previous; verycomplicated; solution achieving the same time bounds in the RAM model made essentialuse of arrays and extensive use of redundant counter schemes to maintain balance. Oursolution uses neither. Our key simplification is to discard the structure of the smaller heapwhen doing a meld. We use the pigeonhole principle in place of the redundant countermechanism.,Proceedings of the forty-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2012,30
A time efficient indexing scheme for complex spatiotemporal retrieval,George Lagogiannis; Nikos Lorentzos; Spyros Sioutas; Evangelos Theodoridis,Abstract The paper is concerned with the time efficient processing of spatiotemporalpredicates; ie spatial predicates associated with an exact temporal constraint. A set of suchpredicates forms a buffer query or a Spatio-temporal Pattern (STP) Query with time. In themore general case of an STP query; the temporal dimension is introduced via the relativeorder of the spatial predicates (STP queries with order). Therefore; the efficient processing ofa spatiotemporal predicate is crucial for the efficient implementation of more complexqueries of practical interest. We propose an extension of a known approach; suitable forprocessing spatial predicates; which has been used for the efficient manipulation of STPqueries with order. The extended method is supported by efficient indexing structures. Wealso provide experimental results that show the efficiency of the technique.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,6
Geometric Retrieval for Grid Points in the RAM Model.,Spyros Sioutas; Christos Makris; Nectarios Kitsios; George Lagogiannis; John Tsaknakis; Kostas Tsichlas; Bill Vassiliadis,Abstract: We consider the problem of d-dimensional searching (d≥ 3) for four query types:range; partial range; exact match and partial match searching. Let N be the number ofpoints; s be the number of keys specified in a partial match and partial range query and t bethe number of points retrieved. We present a data structure with worst case time complexitiesO (t+ logd− 2 N); O (t+(d− s)+ logs N); O (d+,J. UCS,2004,6
A new algorithm for rectangle enclosure reporting,George Lagogiannis; Christos Makris; Athanasios Tsakalidis,Abstract We present a new algorithm for reporting all the enclosures in a set of plane rectanglesin O(nlognlog logn + k log logn) time and O(n) space (k denotes the output size).

New dynamic balanced search trees with worst-case constant update time,George Lagogiannis; Christos Makris; Yannis Panagis; Spyros Sioutas; Kostas Tsichlas,Abstract We present new search trees with worst-case O (1) update time and O (log n)search time; storing n elements in linear space; in the Pointer Machine (PM) model ofcomputation. In addition; these trees can easily support finger searches in time O (log d) andupdate operations in worst-case O (log* n) time. The parameter d represents the number ofelements (distance) between the search element and an element pointed to by a pointertermed finger. Our data structure is based on a previous result by Fleischer that exhibits thesame asymptotic time and space complexities for simple search trees. We improve on thisresult by handling deletions in an explicit way without using the standard trick of globalrebuilding. This is the first search tree that combines worst-case update times with a localrebalancing scheme without using global rebuilding to tackle deletions.

Partially persistent B-trees with constant worst-case update time,George Lagogiannis; Nikos Lorentzos,Abstract We present two solutions for achieving a partially persistent B-tree with a worst caseconstant update time; in the case that the position of the update is given. The motivation forthis work came from the observation that a known; general approach; which reduces theupdate cost of partially persistent data structures to a constant; has an inherent weaknessconcerning partially persistent B-trees; because it creates big nodes that cannot be retrievedfrom secondary memory in a constant time. Due to this; the I/O complexity of the resultingpartially persistent B-tree is affected. Thus; we attack this specific problem; ie we do notdevelop a general approach for all partially persistent data structures. For our objectives; weadd partial persistence to an ephemeral B-tree with constant worst case update time; byapplying two known general methods; the fat-node and the node-copying method; that …,Computers & Electrical Engineering,2012,2
Indexing moving objects: A real time approach,George Lagogiannis; Nikos Lorentzos; Alexander B Sideridis,Abstract Indexing moving objects usually involves a great amount of updates; caused byobjects reporting their current position. In order to keep the present and past positions of theobjects in secondary memory; each update introduces an I/O and this process is sometimescreating a bottleneck. In this paper we deal with the problem of minimizing the number ofI/Os in such a way that queries concerning the present and past positions of the objects canbe answered efficiently. In particular we propose a new approach that achieves anasymptotically optimal number of I/Os for performing the necessary updates. The approachis based on the assumption that the primary memory suffices for storing the current positionsof the objects.,World Summit on Knowledge Society,2010,1

Query-Optimal Partially Persistent B-Trees with Constant Worst-Case Update Time,George Lagogiannis,In this paper we present the first data structure for partially persistent B-trees with constantworst-case update time; where deletions are handled in a symmetrical to insertions manner.Our structure matches the query times of optimal partially persistent B-trees that do notsupport constant update time thus; we have managed to reduce the worst-case update timeto a constant; without a penalty in the query times. The new data structure is produced bymixing two other data structures;(a) the partially persistent B-tree and (b) the balancedsearch tree with constant worst-case update time.,International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science,2017,*
Parent queries over dynamic balanced parenthesis strings,George Lagogiannis,We maintain a balanced parenthesis string under insertions and deletions of parenthesis-pairs in such a way that we can efficiently answer parent queries; ie; given a parenthesis-pair; we want to find the pair that immediately encloses it. Each parenthesis symbol isattached on a node; and we have n such nodes drawn on a straight line. We achieve O(logn/loglogn) worst-case time per operation on a Pointer Machine; matching the knownlower bound on the problem. By transferring our solution to a RAM; we are able to achieveworst case time per update; assuming that we know in advance that the parenthesis-pair tobe inserted does not destroy the balance of the parenthesis string.,International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science,2014,*
Indexing Techniques for Spatiotemporal Databases,George Lagogiannis; Christos Makris; Yannis Panagis; Spyros Sioutas; Evangelos Theodoridis; Athanasios Tsakalidis,Abstract We can define as spatiotemporal any database that maintains objects withgeometric properties that change over time; where usual geometric properties are the spatialposition and spatial extent of an object in a specific d-dimensional space. The need to usespatiotemporal databases appears in a variety of applications such as intelligenttransportation systems; cellular communications; and meteorology monitoring. This field ofdatabase research collaborates tightly with other research areas such as mobiletelecommunications; and is harmonically integrated with other disciplines such asCAD/CAM; GIS; environmental science; and bioinformatics. Spatiotemporal databases standat the crossroad of two other database research areas: spatial databases (Güting; 1994;Gaede & Gunther; 1998) and temporal databases (Salzberg & Tsotras; 1999).

Reducing structural changes in van Emde Boas' data structure to the lower bound for the dynamic predecessor problem,George Lagogiannis; Christos Makris; Athanasios Tsakalidis,Abstract We consider the problem of maintaining a dynamic ordered set of n integers in auniverse U under the operations of insertion; deletion and predecessor queries. Thecomputation model used is a unit-cost RAM; with a word length of w bits; and the universesize is| U|= 2 w. We present a data structure that uses O (| U|/log| U|+ n) space; performs allthe operations in O (log log| U|) time and needs O (log log| U|/log log log| U|) structuralchanges per update operation. The data structure is a simplified version of the van EmdeBoas' tree introducing; in its construction and functioning; new concepts; which help to keepthe important information for searching along the path of the tree; in a more compact andorganized way.,Journal of Discrete Algorithms,2006,*

ATHANASIOS TSAKALIDIS,GEORGE LAGOGIANNIS; YANNIS PANAGIS; SPYROS SIOUTAS,These needs were acknowledged in the seminal paper of Driscoll et al. [15]; in which the notionof persistent data structures was coined. We concisely present the notion of persistencehere. Consider a data structure D. As an update is applied to D; the update leads D from a versionv i to its next version v i+1 . If persistence is supported; as D undergoes a number of m updateoperations; all versions v 0 ; v 1 ;…; v m-1 are maintained. There we identify two flavours ofpersistence; namely partial persistence and full persistence … Partially persistent data structuresallow storing and accessing all versions; however modifications can only be applied to the mostrecent version.

An algorithmic approach in efficiently maintaining similar versions of knowledge,George Lagogiannis; Alexander B Sideridis,ABSTRACT: In many applications; particularly in Agriculture; it is imperative to maintaindifferent versions of the same knowledge either due to the need of depicting its evolutionthrough time or because different versions can coexist with different valid times. In this paperwe deal with the problem of maintaining simultaneously a set of different temporalknowledge bases; each of which has attached a spatial dimension ie a geographical area ofinterest. Based on the hypothesis that temporal knowledge bases corresponding to adjacentgeographical areas have a small number of differences in their stored rules; we presentproposals for maintaining these temporal knowledge bases; in a space efficient manner.,*,*,*
