Circular polarization dependent cyclotron resonance in large-area graphene in ultrahigh magnetic fields,LG Booshehri; CH Mielke; DG Rickel; SA Crooker; Q Zhang; L Ren; EH Hároz; A Rustagi; CJ Stanton; Z Jin; Z Sun; Z Yan; JM Tour; J Kono,Abstract Using ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 170 T and polarized midinfrared radiation withtunable wavelengths from 9.22 to 10.67 μ m; we studied cyclotron resonance in large-areagraphene grown by chemical vapor deposition. Circular polarization dependent studiesreveal strong p-type doping for as-grown graphene; and the dependence of the cyclotronresonance on radiation wavelength allows for a determination of the Fermi energy. Thermalannealing shifts the Fermi energy to near the Dirac point; resulting in the simultaneousappearance of hole and electron cyclotron resonance in the magnetic quantum limit; eventhough the sample is still p-type; due to graphene's linear dispersion and unique Landaulevel structure. These high-field studies therefore allow for a clear identification of cyclotronresonance features in large-area; low-mobility graphene samples.,Physical Review B,2012,48
Dynamically coupled plasmon-phonon modes in GaP: An indirect-gap polar semiconductor,Kunie Ishioka; Kristina Brixius; Ulrich Höfer; Avinash Rustagi; Evan M Thatcher; Christopher J Stanton; Hrvoje Petek,Abstract The ultrafast coupling dynamics of coherent optical phonons and the photoexcitedelectron-hole plasma in the indirect gap semiconductor GaP are investigated by experimentand theory. For below-gap excitation and probing by 800-nm light; only the bare longitudinaloptical (LO) phonons are observed. For above-gap excitation with 400-nm light; thephotoexcitation creates a high density; nonequilibrium e− h plasma; which introduces anadditional; faster decaying oscillation due to an LO phonon-plasmon coupled (LOPC) mode.The LOPC mode frequency exhibits very similar behavior for both n-and p-doped GaP;downshifting from the LO to the transverse optical (TO) phonon frequency limits withincreasing photoexcited carrier density. We assign the LOPC mode to the LO phononscoupled with the photoexcited multicomponent plasma. For the 400-nm excitation; the …,Physical Review B,2015,13
Coherent phonon spectroscopy characterization of electronic bands at buried semiconductor heterointerfaces,Kunie Ishioka; Kristina Brixius; Andreas Beyer; Avinash Rustagi; Christopher J Stanton; Wolfgang Stolz; Kerstin Volz; Ulrich Höfer; Hrvoje Petek,We demonstrate an all-optical approach to probe electronic band structure at buriedinterfaces involving polar semiconductors. Femtosecond optical pulses excite coherentphonons in epitaxial GaP films grown on Si (001) substrate. We find that the coherentphonon amplitude critically depends on the film growth conditions; specifically in thepresence of antiphase domains; which are independently characterized by transmissionelectron microscopy. We determine the Fermi levels at the buried interface of GaP/Si fromthe coherent phonon amplitudes and demonstrate that the internal electric fields are createdin the nominally undoped GaP films as well as the Si substrates; possibly due to the carriertrapping at the antiphase boundaries and/or at the interface.,Applied Physics Letters,2016,11
Intrinsic coherent acoustic phonons in the indirect band gap semiconductors Si and GaP,Kunie Ishioka; Avinash Rustagi; Ulrich Höfer; Hrvoje Petek; Christopher J Stanton,Abstract We report on the intrinsic optical generation and detection of coherent acousticphonons at (001)-oriented bulk Si and GaP without metallic phonon transducer structures.Photoexcitation by a 3.1-eV laser pulse generates a normal strain pulse within the∼ 100-nmpenetration depth in both semiconductors. The subsequent propagation of the strain pulseinto the bulk is detected with a delayed optical probe as a periodic modulation of the opticalreflectivity. Our theoretical model explains quantitatively the generation of the acoustic pulsevia the deformation potential electron-phonon coupling and detection in terms of thespatially and temporally dependent photoelastic effect for both semiconductors. Comparisonwith our theoretical model reveals that the experimental strain pulses have finite builduptimes of 1.2 and 0.4 ps for GaP and Si; which are comparable with the time required for …,Physical Review B,2017,4
Hot-electron noise properties of graphene-like systems,A Rustagi; CJ Stanton,Abstract We study the hot-electron noise properties of two-dimensional materials with agraphene-like energy dispersion under a strong applied electric field which drives thesystem far from equilibrium. Calculations are based on a Boltzmann–Green-function methodwithin a two-relaxation-time approximation that allows for both inelastic scattering comingfrom electron-phonon scattering and elastic scattering coming from electron-impurityscattering. The steady-state distribution function is used to calculate the average current andthe low-frequency spectral density for current fluctuations (noise) in the nonequilibriumsteady-state. We find that as the electric field strength increases; the noise decreases fromits equilibrium thermal noise value. This is in contrast with semiconductors with a quadraticenergy–wave-vector dispersion where the noise increases in a constant-relaxation-time …,Physical Review B,2014,2
Photoemission signature of excitons,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander F Kemper,Abstract: Excitons-the particle-hole bound states-composed of localized electron-hole statesin semiconducting systems are crucial to explaining the optical spectrum. Spectroscopicmeasurements can contain signatures of these two particle bound states and can beparticularly useful in determining the characteristics of these excitons. We formulate anexpression for evaluating the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum arising from theionization of excitons given their steady-state distribution in a semiconductor. We show thatthe spectrum contains information about the direct/indirect band gap nature of thesemiconductor and is located below the conduction band minimum displaced by the bindingenergy. The dispersive features of the spectrum contains remnants of the valence band. Ourresults indicate that for most exciton probability distributions; the energy integrated …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.07270,2018,1
Detecting the Photoexcited Carrier Distribution Across GaAs/Transition Metal Oxide Interfaces by Coherent Longitudinal Acoustic Phonons,Kevin L Pollock; Hoang Q Doan; Avinash Rustagi; Christopher J Stanton; Tanja Cuk,A prominent architecture for solar energy conversion layers diverse materials; such astraditional semiconductors (Si; III–V) and transition metal oxides (TMOs); into a monolithicdevice. The efficiency with which photoexcited carriers cross each layer is critical to deviceperformance and dependent on the electronic properties of a heterojunction. Here; by time-resolved changes in the reflectivity after excitation of an n-GaAs/p-GaAs/TMO (Co3O4; IrO2)device; we detect a photoexcited carrier distribution specific to the p-GaAs/TMO interfacethrough its coupling to phonons in both materials. The photoexcited carriers generate twocoherent longitudinal acoustic phonons (CLAPs) traveling in opposite directions; one intothe TMO and the other into the p-GaAs. This is the first time a CLAP is reported to originate ata semiconductor/TMO heterojunction. Therefore; these experiments seed future modeling …,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2017,1
Terahertz radiation from accelerating charge carriers in graphene under ultrafast photoexcitation,Avinash Rustagi; CJ Stanton,Abstract We study the generation of terahertz (THz) radiation from the acceleration ofultrafast photoexcited charge carriers in graphene in the presence of a dc electric field. Ourmodel is based on calculating the transient current density from the time-dependentdistribution function which is determined using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE)within a relaxation time approximation. We include the time-dependent generation ofcarriers by the pump pulse by solving for the carrier generation rate using the optical Blochequations in the rotating wave approximation (RWA). The linearly polarized pump pulsegenerates an anisotropic distribution of photoexcited carriers in the kx− ky plane. Thecollision integral in the Boltzmann equation includes a term that leads to the thermalizationof carriers via carrier-carrier scattering to an effective temperature above the lattice …,Physical Review B,2016,1

Non-equilibrium Electron Dynamics In Pump-Probe Spectroscopy: Role Of Excited Phonon Populations,Omadillo Abdurazakov; Avinash Rustagi; James Freericks; Alexander Kemper,The time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(tr-ARPES) has emerged as a powerfultool to study the single-particle as well as collective dynamics of elementary excitations. Thedynamics allow for the measurement of energy transfer between degrees of freedom such aselectrons and phonons. When significant energy is deposited by the pump; or when the phononsare resonantly excited; the effect of excited phonons on the electrons plays an importantrole. We examine the relaxation dynamics of electrons coupled to a bath of optical phonons whensubjected to an ultrafast optical excitation be solving the equation of motion for the coupled systemwithin a non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism. By comparing the decay rates of electron populationswhen interacting with the phonons of fixed properties to those of dynamically modifiedproperties; we gain insight into the role of the excited phonon populations; they are found …,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
Observing excitons with time-resolved ARPES,Alexander Kemper; Avinash Rustagi,With the development and spread of time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(tr-ARPES) comes the capability of observing electrons in the conduction bands ofsemiconductors after an ultrashort pump pulse. In systems with large Coulomb interactions;such as the two-dimensional dichalcogenide materials (eg MoS 2); the possibility exists ofthe excited electrons binding with the holes in the valence band and forming excitons; andthese may be observed through tr-ARPES. We show what the signatures of these excitationsare; what the relationship is between the dispersion of the observed electrons and theunderlying material properties such as conductance/valence band effective masses andexciton radii; and discuss their time dependence.,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
Room Temperature Electron-Hole Liquid in quasi-2D monolayer MoS $ _2$,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander Kemper,Strong correlations between electrons and holes can drive the system to the electron-holeliquid (EHL) state typically at high carrier densities and low temperatures. We study theformation of such a correlated electron-hole liquid state in monolayer MoS $ _2 $; a quasi-2D system where interactions between charge carriers are governed by the Keldyshpotential. We calculate the free energy at finite temperatures using the\textit {linked clusterexpansion} method incorporating ring diagrams. The variation of thermodynamic conjugatevariables indicate a first-order phase transition with a critical temperature larger than roomtemperature. We construct the phase diagram in the temperature-density phase space byMaxwell construction of thermodynamically unstable region demarcating phase spaceregions corresponding to exciton/electron-hole gas; electron-hole liquid and the region of …,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
Theoretical Phase Diagram for the Room-Temperature Electron–Hole Liquid in Photoexcited Quasi-Two-Dimensional Monolayer MoS2,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander F Kemper,Strong correlations between electrons and holes can drive the existence of an electron–holeliquid (EHL) state; typically at high carrier densities and low temperatures. The recentemergence of quasi-two-dimensional (2D) monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) provides ideal systems to explore the EHL state since ineffective screening of theout-of-plane field lines in these quasi-2D systems allows for stronger charge carriercorrelations in contrast to conventional 3D bulk semiconductors and enables the existenceof the EHL at high temperatures. Here we construct the phase diagram for the photoinducedfirst-order phase transition from a plasma of electron–hole pairs to a correlated EHL state insuspended monolayer MoS2. We show that the quasi-2D nature of monolayer TMDCs andthe ineffective screening of the out-of-plane field lines allow for this phase transition to …,Nano letters,2017,*
Ultrafast Electron And Lattice Dynamics,Omadillo Abdurazakov; Avinash Rustagi; James Freericks; Alexander Kemper,The electron-lattice interactions have been subject to intense study since the dawn ofcondensed matter physics. Recent advances in the pump-probe spectroscopy brought abouta fresh perspective into their fundamental role in the normal and emergent phases of matter.We study the ultrafast dynamics of the excited electron populations in a 2D band by a laserpump field when coupled to the optical phonons with the fixed and dynamically updatedproperties. The trARPES spectra of photoexcited electrons indicate that the inclusion ofphonon dynamics strongly influences the single particle as well as many-body properties.The spectra acquire a diffused and broad structure owing to the increased phononoccupation. We also observe that the kink; traditionally regarded as the strength of theelectron-phonon interaction; is strongly weakened.

Sub-picosecond acoustic pulses at buried GaP/Si interfaces,Kunie Ishioka; Avinash Rustagi; Andreas Beyer; Wolfgang Stolz; Kerstin Volz; Ulrich Höfer; Hrvoje Petek; Christopher J Stanton,We report on the optical generation and detection of ultrashort acoustic pulses thatpropagate in three-dimensional semiconductor crystals. Photoexcitation of lattice-matchedGaP layers grown on Si (001) gives rise to a sharp spike in transient reflectivity due to theacoustic pulse generated at the GaP/Si interface and detected at the GaP surface and viceversa. The extremely short width of the reflectivity spike; 0.5 ps; would translate to a spatialextent of 3 nm or 10 atomic bilayers; which is comparable with the width of the intermixinglayer at the GaP/Si interface. The reflectivity signals are also modified by quasi-periodicBrillouin oscillations arising from the propagation of the acoustic pulses in the GaP and Sicrystals. The present results demonstrate the potential applications of the simple opticalpump-probe scheme in the nondestructive evaluation of the buried semiconductor …,Applied Physics Letters,2017,*
Non-equilibrium exciton dynamics in model systems,Avinash Rustagi; Alexander Kemper,Abstract Ultrashort laser pulses are used to observe time resolved dynamics in condensedmatter systems. The typical time resolved measurements include reflection; transmissionand absorption using pump-probe spectroscopy where a pump pulse excites the system intoa non-equilibrium state and the subsequent probe pulse measures the dynamical relaxationof the system as a function of a delay time. We study the two-particle properties of a modelinteracting two-band Hamiltonian by solving the non-equilibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation forthe correlation function. This allows us to study the dynamics of electron-hole bound statesie excitons; in model systems where the time translational invariance is broken by the pumppulse.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2017,*
Sub-picosecond acoustic pulses generated at buried GaP/Si interfaces,Kunie Ishioka; Avinash Rustagi; Andreas Beyer; Wolfgang Stolz; Kerstin Volz; Ulrich Hoefer; Hrvoje Petek; Christopher J Stanton,Abstract: Photoexcitation of a lattice-matched GaP/Si (001) interface with a femtosecondlaser pulse generates coherent acoustic phonons; which propagate ballistically into bothGaP and Si. The acoustic pulses induce quasi-periodic modulations in the reflectivitythrough the photoelastic effect. When the acoustic pulse strikes the GaP/air surface; itinduces surface expansion and gives rise to a ultrashort (~ 0.5 ps) spike in the reflectivity.The extremely short duration of the acoustic pulse; which corresponds to spatial extent of 3nm; indicates that it is generated exclusively at the atomically abrupt GaP/Si interface.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.01239,2016,*
Ultrashort acoustic pulses generated in Si and GaP,Kunie Ishioka; Avinash Rustagi; Ulrich Höfer; Hrvoje Petek; Christopher J Stanton,Abstract: We report on the intrinsic generation and detection of coherent acoustic phonons at(001)-oriented bulk Si and GaP. Photoexcitation by a 3.1-eV laser pulse within~ 100-nmabsorption depth generates a normal strain pulse in both semiconductors; whosepropagation into the bulk is detected nu a delayed probe pulse as a Fabry-Perot typeinterference in a transient reflectivity scheme. The oscillation amplitude for GaP isconsistently larger than for Si for the probe photon energy E between 2.0 and 3.1 eV. Theamplitude increases with increasing probe energy E; more steeply for GaP than for Si.

Introduction Absorption of an ultrashort laser pulse at a solid surface canlead to generation of coherent acoustic phonons in the form of an ultrasonic strain pulse [1]. Abruptheating of the electronic and lattice sub-systems causes a build-up of uniaxial stress over a spatialextent on the order of the optical penetration depth. The ballistic propagation of the acoustic phononsin the solid can be monitored by transient reflectivity measurements; either as recurring echoesif the solid is opaque to the probe light; or as a sinusoidal modulation if the crystal istransparent. For the transparent solids; a thin capping layer is often added; where the …,International Conference on Ultrafast Phenomena,2016,*

Coupled Plasmon Phonon Dynamics in GaP: an indirect gap polar semiconductor,Avinash Rustagi; Evan M Thatcher; Christopher J Stanton; Kunie Ishioka; Kristina Brixius; Ulrich Hofer; Hrvoje Petek,Abstract Transient Depletion Field Screening (TDFS) is the dominant mechanism behindcoupled plasmon-phonon oscillations in polar semiconductors for above gapphotoexcitation. Here the surface field distorting the polar lattice is screened by photoexcitedplasma initiating coupled oscillations. These oscillations modify the optical property of thematerial and are observed in reflectivity measurements. We model these oscillations via aset of coupled differential equations in electronic polarization and lattice polarization. Weconsider the effects of lateral inhomogeneity and diffusion of photoexcited carriers which iscrucial to understand the experimental results. The spectrum shows an LO (LongitudinalOptical) phonon peak alongside a LOPC (Longitudinal Optical Plasmon Coupled) peak.Lateral inhomogeneity accounts for the beating phenomenon between these frequencies.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2016,*
Theoretical modeling of the terahertz response of ultrafast photoexcited charge carriers in graphene,Avinash Rustagi; Christopher J Stanton,Abstract We have formulated a semi-classical model to capture the terahertz response ofphotoexcited charge carriers in graphene. The model involves the time evolution of the initialcarrier distribution function excited by a femtosecond laser pulse by solving the Boltzmannequation within the relaxation time approximation in presence of an in-plane DC electricfield. We solve for the time dependent average velocity using the distribution functionobtained from the Boltzmann equation. The time derivative of this average velocity isproportional to the terahertz signal measured in experiments. We also consider thecontribution of virtual carriers to the terahertz signal. This model can also be applied tosystems with a gapped graphene-like dispersion.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2014,*

For high values of electric field; we find interestingbehavior in the noise properties which appear due to hot electron effects. We study the low-frequency noise based on the Boltzmann-Green function method within the relaxation timeapproximation considering an inelastic scattering term coming from phonon scattering andan elastic scattering term coming from impurity scattering. The steady-state distributionfunction is evaluated to calculate the average behavior of physical observables like currentand energy. We find that as the field strength is increased; the noise decreases from thethermal noise value. We have also studied these properties for electronic dispersion with …,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2013,*

For the GaP/Si sample I; the “exact”Si (001) substrate with a 0.1◦ miscut in the [110] direction is used. First; a homoepitaxial Si-buffer layer is deposited on the Si substrate and annealed in H2 atmosphere to form doublesteps. The GaP nucleation layer of 7 nm in thickness is then grown at 450◦ C; followed by thegrowth at 675◦ C. This procedure minimizes the density of planar defects and enhances theself-annihilation (kinking) of antiphase domains (APDs) with boundaries on the {112} and{110} planes [Fig. 1c]. Sample II is grown in the same procedures as sample I; except thatthe second step of the GaP film growth is carried out at 450◦ C.
