Group recommendation: Semantics and efficiency,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy; Ashish Chawlat; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract We study the problem of group recommendation. Recommendation is an importantinformation exploration paradigm that retrieves interesting items for users based on theirprofiles and past activities. Single user recommendation has received significant attention inthe past due to its extensive use in Amazon and Netflix. How to recommend to a group ofusers who may or may not share similar tastes; however; is still an open problem. The needfor group recommendation arises in many scenarios: a movie for friends to watch together; atravel destination for a family to spend a holiday break; and a good restaurant for colleaguesto have a working lunch. Intuitively; items that are ideal for recommendation to a group maybe quite different from those for individual members. In this paper; we analyze the desiderataof group recommendation and propose a formal semantics that accounts for both item …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,253
Finding frequent items in probabilistic data,Qin Zhang; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,Abstract Computing statistical information on probabilistic data has attracted a lot of attentionrecently; as the data generated from a wide range of data sources are inherently fuzzy oruncertain. In this paper; we study an important statistical query on probabilistic data: findingthe frequent items. One straightforward approach to identify the frequent items in aprobabilistic data set is to simply compute the expected frequency of an item and decide if itexceeds a certain fraction of the expected size of the whole data set. However; this simpledefinition misses important information about the internal structure of the probabilistic dataand the interplay among all the uncertain entities. Thus; we propose a new definition basedon the possible world semantics that has been widely adopted for many query types inuncertain data management; trying to find all the items that are likely to be frequent in a …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,218
Semantics of ranking queries for probabilistic data and expected ranks,Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,When dealing with massive quantities of data; top-k queries are a powerful technique forreturning only the k most relevant tuples for inspection; based on a scoring function. Theproblem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzedextensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps evengreater in probabilistic databases; where a relation can encode exponentially many possibleworlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms forranking queries over probabilistic data. However; these all lack many of the intuitiveproperties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically; we define a number of fundamentalproperties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability;which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,212

Facetedpedia: dynamic generation of query-dependent faceted interfaces for wikipedia,Chengkai Li; Ning Yan; Senjuti B Roy; Lekhendro Lisham; Gautam Das,Abstract This paper proposes Facetedpedia; a faceted retrieval system for informationdiscovery and exploration in Wikipedia. Given the set of Wikipedia articles resulting from akeyword query; Facetedpedia generates a faceted interface for navigating the result articles.Compared with other faceted retrieval systems; Facetedpedia is fully automatic and dynamicin both facet generation and hierarchy construction; and the facets are based on the richsemantic information from Wikipedia. The essence of our approach is to build upon thecollaborative vocabulary in Wikipedia; more specifically the intensive internal structures(hyperlinks) and folksonomy (category system). Given the sheer size and complexity of thiscorpus; the space of possible choices of faceted interfaces is prohibitively large. We proposemetrics for ranking individual facet hierarchies by user's navigational cost; and metrics for …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,110
Minimum-effort driven dynamic faceted search in structured databases,Senjuti Basu Roy; Haidong Wang; Gautam Das; Ullas Nambiar; Mukesh Mohania,Abstract In this paper; we propose minimum-effort driven navigational techniques forenterprise database systems based on the faceted search paradigm. Our proposedtechniques dynamically suggest facets for drilling down into the database such that the costof navigation is minimized. At every step; the system asks the user a question or a set ofquestions on different facets and depending on the user response; dynamically fetches thenext most promising set of facets; and the process repeats. Facets are selected based ontheir ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples; as well as on the ability of theuser to provide desired values for them. Our facet selection algorithms also work inconjunction with any ranked retrieval model where a ranking function imposes a bias overthe user preferences for the selected tuples. Our methods are principled as well as …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,104
Rare somatic cells from human breast tissue exhibit extensive lineage plasticity,Somdutta Roy; Philippe Gascard; Nancy Dumont; Jianxin Zhao; Deng Pan; Sarah Petrie; Marta Margeta; Thea D Tlsty,Abstract We identified cell surface markers associated with repression of p16 INK4a/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A); a critical determinant in the acquisition of a plasticstate. These cell surface markers allowed direct isolation of rare cells from healthy humanbreast tissue that exhibit extensive lineage plasticity. This subpopulation is poised totranscribe plasticity markers; OCT3/4; SOX2; and NANOG; at levels similar to thosemeasured in human embryonic stem cells and to acquire a plastic state sensitive toenvironmental programming. In vitro; in vivo; and teratoma assays demonstrated that eithera directly sorted (uncultured) or a single-cell (clonogenic) cell population from primary tissuecan differentiate into functional derivatives of each germ layer; ectodermal; endodermal; andmesodermal. In contrast to other cells that express OCT3/4; SOX2; and NANOG; these …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2013,72
Interactive itinerary planning,Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Cong Yu,Planning an itinerary when traveling to a city involves substantial effort in choosing Points-of-Interest (POIs); deciding in which order to visit them; and accounting for the time it takes tovisit each POI and transit between them. Several online services address different aspects ofitinerary planning but none of them provides an interactive interface where users givefeedbacks and iteratively construct their itineraries based on personal interests and timebudget. In this paper; we formalize interactive itinerary planning as an iterative processwhere; at each step:(1) the user provides feedback on POIs selected by the system;(2) thesystem recommends the best itineraries based on all feedback so far; and (3) the systemfurther selects a new set of POIs; with optimal utility; to solicit feedback for; at the next step.This iterative process stops when the user is satisfied with the recommended itinerary.

Location-aware type ahead search on spatial databases: semantics and efficiency,Senjuti Basu Roy; Kaushik Chakrabarti,Abstract Users often search spatial databases like yellow page data using keywords to findbusinesses near their current location. Typing the entire query is cumbersome and prone toerrors; especially from mobile phones. We address this problem by introducing type-aheadsearch functionality on spatial databases. Like keyword search on spatial data; type-aheadsearch needs to be location-aware; ie; with every letter being typed; it needs to return spatialobjects whose names (or descriptions) are valid completions of the query string typed so far;and which rank highest in terms of proximity to the user's location and other static scores.Existing solutions for type-ahead search cannot be used directly as they are not location-aware. We show that a straight-forward combination of existing techniques for performingtype-ahead search with those for performing proximity search perform poorly. We propose …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,59
Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52
Task assignment optimization in knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing,Senjuti Basu Roy; Ioanna Lykourentzou; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das,Abstract We present SmartCrowd; a framework for optimizing task assignment in knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing (KI-C). SmartCrowd distinguishes itself by formulating; for the firsttime; the problem of worker-to-task assignment in KI-C as an optimization problem; byproposing efficient adaptive algorithms to solve it and by accounting for human factors; suchas worker expertise; wage requirements; and availability inside the optimization process. Wepresent rigorous theoretical analyses of the task assignment optimization problem andpropose optimal and approximation algorithms with guarantees; which rely on index pre-computation and adaptive maintenance.

Constructing and exploring composite items,Senjuti Basu Roy; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Ashish Chawla; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract Nowadays; online shopping has become a daily activity. Web users purchase avariety of items ranging from books to electronics. The large supply of online products callsfor sophisticated techniques to help users explore available items. We propose to buildcomposite items which associate a central item with a set of packages; formed by satelliteitems; and help users explore them. For example; a user shopping for an iPhone (ie; thecentral item) with a price budget can be presented with both the iPhone and a package ofother items that match well with the iPhone (eg;{Belkin case; Bose sounddock; Kroo USBcable}) as a composite item; whose total price is within the user's budget. We define andstudy the problem of effective construction and exploration of large sets of packagesassociated with a central item; and design and implement efficient algorithms for solving …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,48

While computing individualrecommendations have received lots of attention (eg; Netflix prize); group recommendationhas been confined to studying users' satisfaction with different aggregation strategies. In thispaper (Some results are published in an earlier conference paper (Amer-Yahia et al. inVLDB; 2009). See Sect."

A probabilistic optimization framework for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with less conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. We analyze thesesolutions; experimentally verify their efficiency and effectiveness; and illustrate their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,42
Dynacet: Building dynamic faceted search systems over databases,Senjuti Basu Roy; Haidong Wang; Ullas Nambiar; Gautam Das; Mukesh Mohania,Extracting information and insights from large databases is a time-consuming activity andhas received considerable research attention recently. In this demo; we present DynaCet-adomain independent system that provides effective minimum-effort based dynamic facetedsearch solutions over enterprise databases. At every step; Dynacet suggests facetsdepending on the user response in the previous step. Facets are selected based on theirability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples; as well as on the ability of the userto provide desired values for them. The benefits provided include faster access toinformation stored in databases while taking into consideration the variance in userknowledge and preferences.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Big data solutions for predicting risk-of-readmission for congestive heart failure patients,Kiyana Zolfaghar; Naren Meadem; Ankur Teredesai; Senjuti Basu Roy; Si-Chi Chin; Brian Muckian,Developing holistic predictive modeling solutions for risk prediction is extremely challengingin healthcare informatics. Risk prediction involves integration of clinical factors with socio-demographic factors; health conditions; disease parameters; hospital care qualityparameters; and a variety of variables specific to each health care provider making the taskincreasingly complex. Unsurprisingly; many of such factors need to be extractedindependently from different sources; and integrated back to improve the quality of predictivemodeling. Such sources are typically voluminous; diverse; and vary significantly over thetime. Therefore; distributed and parallel computing tools collectively termed big data have tobe developed. In this work; we study big data driven solutions to predict the 30-day risk ofreadmission for congestive heart failure (CHF) incidents. First; we extract useful factors …,Big Data; 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,31
From group recommendations to group formation,Senjuti Basu Roy; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Rui Liu,Abstract There has been significant recent interest in the area of group recommendations;where; given groups of users of a recommender system; one wants to recommend top-$ k $items to a group that maximize the satisfaction of the group members; according to a chosensemantics of group satisfaction. Examples semantics of satisfaction of a recommendeditemset to a group include the so-called least misery (LM) and aggregate voting (AV). Weconsider the complementary problem of how to form groups such that the users in theformed groups are most satisfied with the suggested top-k recommendations. We assumethat the recommendations will be generated according to one of the two grouprecommendation semantics--LM or AV. Rather than assuming groups are given; or rely onad hoc group formation dynamics; our framework allows a strategic approach for forming …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2015,25

Crowds; not drones: modeling human factors in interactive crowdsourcing,Senjuti Basu Roy; Ioanna Lykourentzou; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das,In this vision paper; we propose SmartCrowd; an intelligent and adaptive crowdsourcingframework. Contrary to existing crowdsourcing systems; where the process of hiring workers(crowd); learning their skills; and evaluating the accuracy of tasks they perform arefragmented; siloed; and often ad-hoc; SmartCrowd foresees a paradigm shift in that process;considering unpredictability of human nature; namely human factors. SmartCrowd offersopportunities in making crowdsourcing intelligent through iterative interaction with theworkers; and adaptively learning and improving the underlying processes. Both existing(majority of which do not require longer engagement from volatile and mostly non-recurrentworkers) and next generation crowdsourcing applications (which require longerengagement from the crowd) stand to benefit from SmartCrowd.

Enteric diseases are often caused by poor hygiene and can contribute to stunting.From 50 randomly selected villages in Bangladesh; we collected quantitative and qualitativedata on handwashing linked to child feeding to integrate handwashing promotion into ayoung child complementary feeding program. Most participants stated that the communityknew the importance of handwashing with soap before food preparation and feeding a child;but had not developed the habit. We observed no handwashing with soap at these keytimes; sometimes hands were rinsed with water only. Most participants cited theunavailability of soap and water near the cooking place as a barrier to handwashing beforefood preparation. Most caregivers ranked nurturing messages as the best motivator toencourage handwashing with soap.

On inductor simulation using a unity-gain amplifier,SC Dutta Roy; V Nagarajan,The authors deal with two recently reported active circuits for realization of a groundedinductor using a single unity-gain amplifier and RC networks. It is shown that the inductanceparameters are very sensitive to amplifier gain; this can be remedied by using a high-gaindifferential-input operational amplifier. Amplifier imperfection in respect of nonzero outputimpedance is found to make both circuits behave similarly. Sensitivity of tuned circuits usingthe active inductances is analyzed and conditions for minimum sensitivity are derived.,IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,1970,19

Risk-o-meter: an intelligent clinical risk calculator,Kiyana Zolfaghar; Jayshree Agarwal; Deepthi Sistla; Si-Chi Chin; Senjuti Basu Roy; Nele Verbiest,Abstract We present a system called Risk-O-Meter to predict and an-alyze clinical risk viadata imputation; visualization; predic-tive modeling; and association rule exploration.Clinical risk calculators provide information about a person's chance of having a disease orencountering a clinical event. Such tools could be highly useful to educate patients tounderstand and monitor their health conditions. Unlike existing risk calcu-lators that areprimarily designed for domain experts; Risk-O-Meter is useful to patients who are unfamiliarwith medi-cal terminologies; or providers who have limited information about a patient. Risk-O-Meter is designed in a way such that it is flexible enough to accept limited or incompletedata in-puts; and still manages to predict the clinical risk efficiently and effectively.

Exploring preprocessing techniques for prediction of risk of readmission for congestive heart failure patients,Naren Meadem; Nele Verbiest; Kiyana Zolfaghar; Jayshree Agarwal; Si-Chi Chin; Senjuti Basu Roy,ABSTRACT Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization;and studies show that many of these admissions are readmissions within a short window oftime. Identifying CHF patients who are at a greater risk of hospitalization can guide theimplementation of appropriate plans to prevent these readmissions. Developing predictivemodeling solutions for such disease related risk of readmissions is extremely challenging inhealthcare informatics. It involves integration of socio-demographic factors; healthconditions; disease parameters; hospital care quality parameters; and a variety of variablesspecific to health care providers making the task immensely complex.

Worker skill estimation in team-based tasks,Habibur Rahman; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Senjuti Basu Roy; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das,Abstract Many emerging applications such as collaborative editing; multi-player games; orfan-subbing require to form a team of experts to accomplish a task together. Existingresearch has investigated how to assign workers to such team-based tasks to ensure thebest outcome assuming the skills of individual workers to be known. In this work; weinvestigate how to estimate individual worker's skill based on the outcome of the team-basedtasks they have undertaken. We consider two popular skill aggregation functions andestimate the skill of the workers; where skill is either a deterministic value or a probabilitydistribution. We propose efficient solutions for worker skill estimation using continuous anddiscrete optimization techniques. We present comprehensive experiments and validate thescalability and effectiveness of our proposed solutions using multiple real-world datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,15
Exploiting group recommendation functions for flexible preferences,Senjuti Basu Roy; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,We examine the problem of enabling the flexibility of updating one's preferences in grouprecommendation. In our setting; any group member can provide a vector of preferences that;in addition to past preferences and other group members' preferences; will be accounted forin computing group recommendation. This functionality is essential in many grouprecommendation applications; such as travel planning; online games; book clubs; orstrategic voting; as it has been previously shown that user preferences may vary dependingon mood; context; and company (ie; other people in the group). Preferences are enforced inan feedback box that replaces preferences provided by the users by a potentially differentfeedback vector that is better suited for maximizing the individual satisfaction whencomputing the group recommendation.

Computing best coverage path in the presence of obstacles in a sensor field,Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Sajal Das,Abstract We study the presence of obstacles in computing BCP (s; t)(Best Coverage Pathbetween two points s and t) in a 2D field under surveillance by sensors. Consider a set of mline segment obstacles and n point sensors on the plane. For any path between s to t; p isthe least protected point along the path such that the Euclidean distance between p and itsclosest sensor is maximum. This distance (the path's cover value) is minimum for a BCP (s;t). We present two algorithmic results. For opaque obstacles; ie; which obstruct paths andblock sensing capabilities of sensors; computation of BCP (s; t) takes O ((m 2 n 2+ n 4) log(mn+ n 2)) time and O (m 2 n 2+ n 4) space. For transparent obstacles; ie; which onlyobstruct paths; but allows sensing; computation of BCP (s; t) takes O (nm 2+ n 3) time and O(m 2+ n 2) space.

Predicting 30-Day Risk and Cost of" All-Cause" Hospital Readmissions.,Shanu Sushmita; Garima Khulbe; Aftab Hasan; Stacey Newman; Padmashree Ravindra; Senjuti Basu Roy; Martine De Cock; Ankur Teredesai,Abstract The hospital readmission rate of patients within 30 days after discharge is broadlyaccepted as a healthcare quality measure and cost driver in the United States. The ability toestimate hospitalization costs alongside 30 day risk-stratification for such readmissionsprovides additional benefit for accountable care; now a global issue and foundation for theUS government mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Recent data mining efforts eitherpredict healthcare costs or risk of hospital readmission; but not both. In this paper we presenta dual predictive modeling effort that utilizes healthcare data to predict the risk and cost ofany hospital readmission (“all-cause”). For this purpose; we explore machine learningalgorithms to do accurate predictions of healthcare costs and risk of 30-day readmission.Results on risk prediction for “all-cause” readmission compared to the standardized …,AAAI Workshop: Expanding the Boundaries of Health Informatics Using AI,2016,11
Fast best-effort search on graphs with multiple attributes,Senjuti Basu Roy; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Spiros Papadimitriou,We address the problem of search on graphs with multiple nodal attributes. We call suchgraphs weighted attribute graphs (WAGs). Nodes of a WAG exhibit multiple attributes withvarying; non-negative weights. WAGs are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Forexample; in a co-authorship WAG; each author is a node; each attribute corresponds to aparticular topic (eg; databases; data mining; and machine learning); and the amount ofexpertise in a particular topic is represented by a non-negative weight on that attribute. Atypical search in this setting specifies both connectivity between nodes and constraints onweights of nodal attributes.

IQR: an interactive query relaxation system for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We present IQR; a system that demonstrates optimization based interactiverelaxations for queries that return an empty answer. Given an empty answer; IQRdynamically suggests one relaxation of the original query conditions at a time to the user;based on certain optimization objectives; and the user responds by either accepting ordeclining the relaxation; until the user arrives at a non-empty answer; or a non-emptyanswer is impossible to achieve with any further relaxations. The relaxation suggestionshinge on a proba-bilistic framework that takes into account the probability of the useraccepting a suggested relaxation; as well as how much that relaxation serves towards theoptimization objec-tive. IQR accepts a wide variety of optimization objectives-user centricobjectives; such as; minimizing the number of user interactions (ie; effort) or returning …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,11
Dynamic hierarchical classification for patient risk-of-readmission,Senjuti Basu Roy; Ankur Teredesai; Kiyana Zolfaghar; Rui Liu; David Hazel; Stacey Newman; Albert Marinez,Abstract Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a serious chronic condition often leading to 50%mortality within 5 years. Improper treatment and post-discharge care of CHF patients leadsto repeat frequent hospitalizations (ie; readmissions). Accurately predicting patient's risk-of-readmission enables care-providers to plan resources; perform factor analysis; and improvepatient quality of life. In this paper; we describe a supervised learning framework; DynamicHierarchical Classification (DHC) for patient's risk-of-readmission prediction. Learning thehierarchy of classifiers is often the most challenging component of such classificationschemes. The novelty of our approach is to algorithmically generate various layers andcombine them to predict overall 30-day risk-of-readmission. While the components of DHCare generic; in this work; we focus on congestive heart failure (CHF); a pressing chronic …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2015,10

Accurately predicting the risk-of-readmission may allow hospitals to identify high-risk patients and eventually improve qualityof care by identifying factors that contribute to such readmissions in many scenarios. In thispaper; we investigate the problem of predicting risk-of-readmission as a supervised learningproblem; using a multi-layer classification approach. Earlier contributions inadequatelyattempted to assess a risk value for 30 day readmission by building a direct predictive modelas opposed to our approach. We first split the problem into various stages;(a) at risk ingeneral (b) risk within 60 days (c) risk within 30 days; and then build suitable classifiers …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.2094,2013,9

Non-linear oscillations using antisymmetric transfer characteristics of a differential pair,SB Roy; D PATRANOBIS,A comprehensive analysis has been presented for a regenerative system with an associatednon-linearity given by the antisymmetric self-saturating characteristics of an emittcr-couplcddifferential pair. Tho asymptotic rise and fall of the saturation characteristics has beenapproximated by a transcendental function of hyperbolic tangent type; which gives a two-parameter (ε; β) oscillator equation rather than a single (ε) Van der Pol equation. It has beenshown that the theoretically (computerized solution) obtained amplitude; frequency andwave shape are more conformable with the experimental results in both harmonic andrelaxation mode of oscillation than for Van der POI'S equation. Particularly in the relaxationmode. Van der Pol's equation fails to account for the sharp rise and semi-exponential decayin the wave shape which is accounted for in this analysis.,International Journal of Electronics Theoretical and Experimental,1977,9
Motivation-aware task assignment in crowdsourcing,Julien Pilourdault; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Dongwon Lee; Senjuti Roy,We investigate how to leverage the notion of motivation in assigning tasks to workers andimproving the performance of a crowdsourcing system. In particular; we propose to modelmotivation as the balance between task diversity–ie; the difference in skills among the tasksto complete; and task payment–ie; the difference between how much a chosen task offers topay and how much other available tasks pay. We propose to test different task assignmentstrategies:(1) relevance; a strategy that assigns matching tasks; ie; those that fit a worker'sprofile;(2) diversity; a strategy that chooses matching and diverse tasks; and (3) div-pay; astrategy that selects matching tasks that offer the best compromise between diversity andpayment. For each strategy; we study multiple iterations where tasks are reassigned toworkers as their motivation evolves. At each iteration; relevance and diversity assign …,EDBT,2017,8

A holistic and principled approach for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty-answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with fewer conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty-answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. Moreover; we discuss twoimportant extensions to the base framework: the specification of a minimum size on the …,The VLDB Journal,2016,4

Feature based task recommendation in crowdsourcing with implicit observations,Habibur Rahman; Lucas Joppa; Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract: Existing research in crowdsourcing has investigated how to recommend tasks toworkers based on which task the workers have already completed; referred to as {\emimplicit feedback}. We; on the other hand; investigate the task recommendation problem;where we leverage both implicit feedback and explicit features of the task. We assume thatwe are given a set of workers; a set of tasks; interactions (such as the number of times aworker has completed a particular task); and the presence of explicit features of each task(such as; task location). We intend to recommend tasks to the workers by exploiting theimplicit interactions; and the presence or absence of explicit features in the tasks.

Computing best coverage path in the presence of obstacles in wireless sensor networks,Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract Given a set S={S 1;…; S n} of n homogeneous wireless sensors deployed in a twodimensional area; a source point s and a destination point t; the least protected point p alonga path P (s; t) is that point such that the Euclidean distance between p and its closest sensornode S i is maximum. This distance between p and S i is called the Cover value of the path P(s; t). The Best Coverage Path between s and t; denoted as BCP (s; t); is the path that has theminimum cover value. Although there exists efficient algorithms to compute BCP in O (n logn) time; the presence of obstacles inside the two dimensional area has not been addressedin the literature. In this thesis; we consider the problem of computing BCP (s; t) in thepresence of m line segment obstacles distributed among n sensors.

Toward Worker-Centric Crowdsourcing.,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract Today; crowdsourcing is used to “taskify” any job ranging from simple receipttranscription to collaborative editing; fan-subbing; and citizen science. Existing work hasmainly focused on improving the processes of task assignment and task completion in arequester-centric way by optimizing for outcome quality under budget constraints. In thispaper; we advocate that accounting for workers' characteristics; ie; human factors in taskassignment and task completion benefits both workers and requesters; and discuss newopportunities raised by worker-centric crowdsourcing. This survey is based on a tutorial thatwas given recently at PVLDB [2].,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2016,3
Human factors in crowdsourcing,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy,Abstract Today; crowdsourcing is used to" taskify" any job ranging from simple receipttranscription to collaborative editing; fan-subbing; citizen science; and citizen journalism.The crowd is typically volatile; its arrival and departure asynchronous; and its levels ofattention and accuracy diverse. Tasks vary in complexity and may necessitate theparticipation of workers with varying degrees of expertise. Sometimes; workers need tocollaborate explicitly and build on each other's contributions to complete a single task. Forexample; in disaster reporting; CrowdMap allows geographically closed people with diverseand complementary skills; to work together to report details about the course of a typhoon orthe aftermath of an earthquake.

An insensitive linear single-element-control pulse generator,SB Roy; D Patranabis; P Kundu,An analytical method is presented here for correctly predicting the behaviour of an emitter-coupled single-ended differential pair of transistors adjusted for the generation of symmetricpulse waveform. Here the antisymmetric self-saturating transfer characteristics of thedifferential pair has been approximated by a transcendental function of hyperbolic tangenttype and the frequency relation ia obtained by jump behaviour. Conditions for minimumsensitivity have been obtained and the scope for obtaining the cancellation of the effect oftemperature on tuning elements is indicated. More comprehensive design criteria arc thusmade available for such circuits in general and experimental verifications through the circuitimplementation of the derived conditions have been made to show the close corroborationof the theoretical expectations with the practical results.,International Journal of Electronics Theoretical and Experimental,1979,3

A framework to recommend interventions for 30-day heart failure readmission risk,Rui Liu; Kiyana Zolfaghar; Si-Chi Chin; Senjuti Basu Roy; Ankur Teredesai,In this paper; we describe a novel framework to recommend personalized interventionstrategies to minimize 30-day readmission risk for heart failure (HF) patients; as they movethrough the provider's cardiac care protocol. We design principled solutions by learning thestructure and parameters of a multi-layer hierarchical Bayesian network from underlyinghigh-dimensional patient data. Next; we generate and summarize the rules leading topersonalized interventions which can be applied to individual patients as they progress fromadmit to discharge. We present comprehensive experimental results as well as interestingcase studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework using large real-world patient datasets on Microsoft Azure for Research platform.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,2
Prediction and management of readmission risk for congestive heart failure,Senjuti Basu Roy; Si Chi Chin,Abstract This position paper investigates the problem of 30-day readmission risk predictionand management for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF); which has been identified as one ofthe leading causes of hospitalization; especially for adults older than 65 years. Theunderlying solution is deeply related to using predictive analytics to compute thereadmission risk score of a patient; and investigating respective risk management strategiesfor her by leveraging statistical analysis or sequence mining techniques. The outcome of thispaper leads to developing a framework that suggests appropriate interventions to a patientduring a hospital stay; at discharge; or post hospital-discharge period that potentially wouldreduce her readmission risk. The primary beneficiaries of this paper are the physicians anddifferent entities involved in the pipeline of health care industry; and most importantly; the …,7th International Conference on Health Informatics; HEALTHINF 2014-Part of 7th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies; BIOSTEC 2014,2014,2

Fast and Effective Pattern Matching on Weighted Attributed Graphs,Senjuti Basu-Roy; Tina Eliassi-Rad; Spiros Papadimitriou,ABSTRACT We address the problem of finding subgraphs that best match a user's query onWeighted Attributed Graphs (WAGs). We define a WAG as a graph where nodes exhibitmultiple attributes with varying; non-negative weights. An example of a WAG is acoauthorship network; where each author has multiple attributes; each corresponding to aparticular topic (eg; databases; data mining; and machine learning); and the amount ofexpertise in a particular topic is represented by a non-negative weight on that attribute. Atypical user query in this setting specifies both connectivity patterns between query nodesand constraints on attribute weights of the query nodes. For example; a user query may havea triangle connectivity pattern where each node is an author with expertise greater than 50%in at least one topic area (ie attribute). We propose a ranking function which unifies the …,ACM Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2013,2
Simulation of Flux Density in a Hybrid Coil Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage Using COMSOL Multiphysics,SATRAJIT Roy; G Konar,Abstract: Energy storage is indispensable for hybrid power systems using non-conventionalresources. Technologies like batteries; compressed air energy storage (CAES); pumpedhydro plants etc. generally have associated energy losses and time delay during energyconversion process. However; there is no energy loss when a Superconducting MagneticEnergy Storage (SMES) unit converts electrical energy stored in the form of magneticenergy. Low Temperature Superconducting (LTS) toroids and solenoids were already inuse. Presently; first and second generation High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coilsare used either independently (for energy storage) or with LTS coils in a hybrid mode (forparticle accelerators). Prototypes of few hybrid coils normally made of BSCCO andNbTi/Nb3Sn have been designed and tested.

Voltage-controlled oscillator using an emitter-coupled differential pair,SB Roy; D Patranabis,A voltage-controlled oscillator using the antisymmetric transfer characteristics of an emitter-coupled differential pair of transistors is presented. Variation of the differential bias conditionof this pair changes the average slope of Its transconductance parameter; thereby changingthe frequency of the near harmonic mode of oscillation in a system which has been shown toproduce van-der-Pol-type oscillations with passive parameter control only. Over a sufficientlywide range of frequency the distortion of this oscillation is reasonably low. A simpleslope/differential-voltage relation is proposed to calculate the frequencies by computersolution of the general relation; as well as by approximate solution by using the method ofsmall parameters. Experimental results are also presented for comparison.,Electronics Letters,1977,2
A temperature-stable RC transistor oscillator,P Kundu; SB Roy,Generation of stable sinusoidal oscillations of fairly good waveform has been realized in abasic multivibrator circuit by optimizing load and coupling elements and introducing anamplitude defining mechanism with the use of emitter coupling. The resulting differentialoperation introduces an inherent tendency of self-compensation against changes of activecircuit parameters; and the frequency remains practically independent of temperaturechange even though transistors are used.,Proceedings of the IEEE,1969,2

A Probabilistic Framework for Estimating Pairwise Distances Through Crowdsourcing.,Habibur Rahman; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das,ABSTRACT Estimating all pairs of distances among a set of objects has wide applicability invarious computational problems in databases; machine learning; and statistics. This workpresents a probabilistic framework for estimating all pair distances through crowdsourcing;where the human workers are involved to provide distance between some object pairs.Since the workers are subject to error; their responses are considered with a probabilisticinterpretation. In particular; the framework comprises of three problems:(1) Given multiplefeedback on an object pair; how do we combine and aggregate those feedback and create aprobability distribution of the distance?(2) Since the number of possible pairs is quadratic inthe number of objects; how do we estimate; from the known feedback for a small numbers ofobject pairs; the unknown distances among all other object pairs?

Eliciting Worker Preference for Task Completion,Mohammadreza Esfandiari; Senjuti Basu Roy; Sihem Amer-Yahia,Abstract: Current crowdsourcing platforms provide little support for worker feedback.Workers are sometimes invited to post free text describing their experience and preferencesin completing tasks. They can also use forums such as Turker Nation1 to exchangepreferences on tasks and requesters. In fact; crowdsourcing platforms rely heavily onobserving workers and inferring their preferences implicitly. In this work; we believe thatasking workers to indicate their preferences explicitly improve their experience in taskcompletion and hence; the quality of their contributions. Explicit elicitation can indeed help tobuild more accurate worker models for task completion that captures the evolving nature ofworker preferences. We design a worker model whose accuracy is improved iteratively byrequesting preferences for task factors such as required skills; task payment; and task …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.03233,2018,*

The Microsoft Academic Search challenges at KDD Cup 2013,Martine De Cock; Senjuti Basu Roy; Swapna Savvana; Vani Mandava; Brian Dalessandro; Claudia Perlich; William Cukierski; Ben Hamner,Microsoft Academic Search is a free search engine specific to scholarly material. It currentlycovers more than 50 million publications and over 19 million authors across a variety ofdomains. One of the main challenges in correctly indexing this material is author nameambiguity and the resulting noise in author profiles. KDD Cup 2013 invited participants totackle this problem in 2 ways:(1) by automatically determining which papers in an authorprofile are truly written by a given author; and (2) by identifying which author profiles need tobe merged because they belong to the same author.

Abstract LB-273: The tumor suppressor p16INK4a regulates extensive plasticity in rare somatic cells found in adult human tissue.,Somdutta Roy; Philippe Gascard; Nancy Dumont; Jianxin Zhao; Deng Pan; Sarah Petrie; Marta Margeta; Thea Dorothy Tlsty,Extensive studies have demonstrated that repression of p16 INK4a (CDKN2A) not onlysilences a powerful tumor suppressor activity; but also is associated with the acquisition of aplastic state; ie the ability of a cell to change phenotypes. In epithelial cells; repression ofp16 INK4a does not only inactivate cell cycle arrest in response to stress but also allowsincreased expression of chromatin remodeling proteins that are important for epigeneticplasticity underlying differentiation. The up-regulation of such chromatin remodeling proteinssets the expression pattern of pluripotent cells in Drosophila and inhibits differentiation anddictates the decision between progenitor and differentiated states in murine myoblasts.Furthermore; mice engineered for knock-out of BMI-1; a polycomb protein that inhibits p16INK4a transcription; fail to repress p16 INK4a activity and fail to generate hematopoietic …,*,2013,*

Crowds; not drones,Senjuti Basu Roy; Ioanna Lykourentzou; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das,Abstract In this vision paper; we propose SmartCrowd; an intelligent and adaptivecrowdsourcing framework. Contrary to existing crowdsourcing systems; where the process ofhiring workers (crowd); learning their skills; and evaluating the accuracy of tasks theyperform are fragmented; siloed; and often ad-hoc; SmartCrowd foresees a paradigm shift inthat process; considering unpredictability of human nature; namely human factors.SmartCrowd offers opportunities in making crowdsourcing intelligent through iterativeinteraction with the workers; and adaptively learning and improving the underlyingprocesses. Both existing (majority of which do not require longer engagement from volatileand mostly nonrecurrent workers) and next generation crowdsourcing applications (whichrequire longer engagement from the crowd) stand to benefit from SmartCrowd.

“Report on ‘Facetedpedia: Dynamic Generation of Query-Dependent Faceted Interfaces for Wikipedia’by Chengkai Li,Ning Yan; Senjuti B Roy; Lekhendro Lisham; Gautam Das,To access any article in Wikipedia; we typically search for a few keywords. All articles containingthese keywords; are returned as results; ranked according to relevance. This works well whenuser is looking for a specific topic and is satisfied with only the articles on this topic. But; it mayhappen that the user is not exactly looking for a particular article on a particular topic. He mightbe exploring a subject and is looking for a set of relevant topics. With only keyword search; theuser has to follow hyperlinks; modify the keywords accordingly and synthesize the informationmanually; by making multiple keyword searches. This is surely a tedious job and serves as theprimary motivation for the need of an interface that can provide the user with all relevantinformation; not only containing the keywords but also related to the keywords in some way.

Computing Best Coverage Path In The Presence Of Obstacles In Wireless Sensor Networks,Senjuti Basu Roy,Given a set S={S1;...; Sn} of n homogeneous wireless sensors deployed in a twodimensional area; a source point s and a destination point t; the least protected point p alonga path (s; t) is that point such that the Euclidean distance between p and its closest sensornode Si is maximum. This distance between p and S_ {i} is called the Cover value of thepath P (s; t). The Best Coverage Path between s and t; denoted as BCP (s; t); is the path thathas the minimum cover value. Although there exists efficient algorithms to compute BCP in O(n log n) time; the presence of obstacles inside the two dimensional area has not beenaddressed in the literature. In this thesis; we consider the problem of computing BCP (s; t) inthe presence of m line segment obstacles distributed among n sensors.

Influence of Confining Pressure on Water Retention Characteristics of Compacted Soil,S Roy; S Rajesh,Abstract Sustainability of earth structures is one of the major concerns in the field ofgeotechnical engineering. Recurring evaluation and maintenance related to earth structurescan often lead to faulty decisions due to errors in analysis. A prominent such concern isrelated to compacted soils in earth structures which are unsaturated in nature and subjectedto stress variations in field. Under the effect of stress state; the key parameters to assess thestrength and deformation behavior of unsaturated soils might undergo various changes. Ingeneral; key parameters are obtained from soil water characteristic curve (SWCC). In thepresent study; an effort has been made to understand the influence of confining pressure onthe SWCC of compacted soil through experimental and analytical studies. The SWCC ofcompacted soil at zero net confinement was obtained using tensiometers (HYPROP) and …,Indian Geotechnical Journal,*,*
EFFECT OF WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS ON BEARING CAPACITY OF FOOTINGS IN UNSATURATED SOILS,Suman Roy; S Rajesh,ABSTRACT: Footings are often subjected to water table fluctuations in engineering practicedue to varying climatic changes throughout a year. A common engineering practice toincorporate the effect of water table is to use the water table correction factor in the ultimatebearing capacity formula. The varying water table causes a variation in the ultimate bearingcapacity of the footing throughout a year. Hence; the bearing capacity of soils may be underpredicted or may be overestimated from the bearing capacity formulations. In the presentstudy; the effect of fluctuating water table has been analyzed on a circular footing using acoupled finite element analysis program in ABAQUS. The variation in the ultimate bearingcapacity is evaluated for a sandy soil. From literature; soil water characteristic curve (SWCC)for the selected soil; dimensions and domain size for the footing were selected. The …,*,*,*

In particular; wepropose to model motivation as the balance between task diversity–ie; the difference in skillsamong the tasks to complete; and task payment–ie; the difference between how much achosen task offers to pay and how much other available tasks pay. We propose to testdifferent task assignment strategies:(1) relevance; a strategy that assigns matching tasks; ie;those that fit a worker's profile;(2) diversity; a strategy that chooses matching and diversetasks; and (3) div-pay; a strategy that selects matching tasks that offer the best compromisebetween diversity and payment.

Machine Learning Models for Surgical Site Infection Prediction,Prathyusha Mandagani; Shaun Coleman; Anam Zahid; Annie Pugel Ehlers; Senjuti Basu Roy; Martine De Cock,Abstract Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are estimated to represent 17% of all hospital-acquired infections. Their impact on morbidity; mortality; and cost of care calls for techniquesto risk stratify patients ahead of surgery. In this paper we train and evaluate machinelearning models (logistic regression; decision trees; and boosted decision trees) that canflag–ahead of surgery–those patients who are likely to develop a SSI. In addition to thegender and the age of the patient at the time of surgery; our models rely only on availableresults from blood tests done prior to the surgery. We obtain the best results with boosteddecision trees (AdaBoost); ie an AUC-score of 86% on a benchmark patient dataset of theUniversity Hospital of North Norway. The outcomes of Glukose and CRP tests stand out inparticular as indicative features for predicting a future SSI.,*,*,*

Simulation of Flux Density in a Hybrid Coil SMES Using COMSOL Multiphysics,S Roy; G Konar,Abstract Energy storage is an essential component for hybrid power system using non-conventional energy resources. Batteries; compressed air energy storage; pumped hydroplants etc. have been developed for storage. However; these have demerits like lossesinvolved in energy conversion and time delay. Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage(SMES) can be a good alternative as it stores electrical energy in the form of magneticenergy involving no loss during supplying the same. Solenoidal or toroidal low temperaturesuperconducting coils (LTS) are in use for SMES [1]. First and second generation hightemperature superconducting (HTS) coils are in operation either independently or with LTScoils in hybrid mode [2; 3].
