TAG allows users to express simple; declarative queriesand have them distributed and executed efficiently in networks of low-power; wirelesssensors. We discuss various generic properties of aggregates; and show how thoseproperties affect the performance of our in network approach.

Automatic subspace clustering of high dimensional data for data mining applications,Rakesh Agrawal; Johannes Gehrke; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Prabhakar Raghavan,Abstract Data mining applications place special requirements on clustering algorithmsincluding: the ability to find clusters embedded in subspaces of high dimensional data;scalability; end-user comprehensibility of the results; non-presumption of any canonical datadistribution; and insensitivity to the order of input records. We present CLIQUE; a clusteringalgorithm that satisfies each of these requirements. CLIQUE identifies dense clusters insubspaces of maximum dimensionality. It generates cluster descriptions in the form of DNFexpressions that are minimized for ease of comprehension. It produces identical resultsirrespective of the order in which input records are presented and does not presume anyspecific mathematical form for data distribution. Through experiments; we show that CLIQUEefficiently finds accurate cluster in large high dimensional datasets.,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,3209

l-diversity: Privacy beyond k-anonymity,Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke; Daniel Kifer; Muthuramakrishnan Venkitasubramaniam,Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is animportant problem. In recent years; a new definition of privacy called\kappa-anonymity hasgained popularity. In a\kappa-anonymized dataset; each record is indistinguishable from atleast k—1 other records with respect to certain" identifying" attributes. In this paper we showwith two simple attacks that a\kappa-anonymized dataset has some subtle; but severeprivacy problems. First; we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitiveattributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second; attackers oftenhave background knowledge; and we show that\kappa-anonymity does not guaranteeprivacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of thesetwo attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called\ell-diversity. In …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

L-diversity: Privacy beyond k-anonymity,Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Daniel Kifer; Johannes Gehrke; Muthuramakrishnan Venkitasubramaniam,In this article; we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has somesubtle but severe privacy problems. First; an attacker can discover the values of sensitiveattributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem.Second; attackers often have background knowledge; and we show that k-anonymity doesnot guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailedanalysis of these two attacks; and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called l-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for l-diversity; we show in an experimental evaluation that l-diversity is practical and can beimplemented efficiently.,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2007,1929
The cougar approach to in-network query processing in sensor networks,Yong Yao; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract The widespread distribution and availability of small-scale sensors; actuators; andembedded processors is transforming the physical world into a computing platform. Onesuch example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes thatcombine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature; light; or seismic sensors withnetworking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control;warehouse inventory; and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networksassume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where thedata is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has twomajor drawbacks. First; the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly.Second; conservation of battery power is a major design factor; but a central system …,ACM Sigmod record,2002,1650
Gossip-based computation of aggregate information,David Kempe; Alin Dobra; Johannes Gehrke,Over the last decade; we have seen a revolution in connectivity between computers; and aresulting paradigm shift from centralized to highly distributed systems. With massive scalealso comes massive instability; as node and link failures become the norm rather than theexception. For such highly volatile systems; decentralized gossip-based protocols areemerging as an approach to maintaining simplicity and scalability while achieving fault-tolerant information dissemination. In this paper; we study the problem of computingaggregates with gossip-style protocols. Our first contribution is an analysis of simple gossip-based protocols for the computation of sums; averages; random samples; quantiles; andother aggregate functions; and we show that our protocols converge exponentially fast to thetrue answer when using uniform gossip. Our second contribution is the definition of a …,Foundations of Computer Science; 2003. Proceedings. 44th Annual IEEE Symposium on,2003,1267
Privacy preserving mining of association rules,Alexandre Evfimievski; Ramakrishnan Srikant; Rakesh Agrawal; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract We present a framework for mining association rules from transactions consisting ofcategorical items where the data has been randomized to preserve privacy of individualtransactions. While it is feasible to recover association rules and preserve privacy using astraightforward “uniform” randomization; the discovered rules can unfortunately be exploitedto find privacy breaches. We analyze the nature of privacy breaches and propose a class ofrandomization operators that are much more effective than uniform randomization in limitingthe breaches. We derive formulae for an unbiased support estimator and its variance; whichallow us to recover itemset supports from randomized datasets; and show how toincorporate these formulae into mining algorithms. Finally; we present experimental resultsthat validate the algorithm by applying it on real datasets.,Information Systems,2004,1129
Sequential pattern mining using a bitmap representation,Jay Ayres; Jason Flannick; Johannes Gehrke; Tomi Yiu,Abstract We introduce a new algorithm for mining sequential patterns. Our algorithm isespecially efficient when the sequential patterns in the database are very long. We introducea novel depth-first search strategy that integrates a depth-first traversal of the search spacewith effective pruning mechanisms. Our implementation of the search strategy combines avertical bitmap representation of the database with efficient support counting. A salientfeature of our algorithm is that it incrementally outputs new frequent itemsets in an onlinefashion. In a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm on standard benchmark datafrom the literature; our algorithm outperforms previous work up to an order of magnitude.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,1094
Towards sensor database systems,Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,Abstract Sensor networks are being widely deployed for measurement; detection andsurveillance applications. In these new applications; users issue long-running queries overa combination of stored data and sensor data. Most existing applications rely on acentralized system for collecting sensor data. These systems lack flexibility because data isextracted in a predefined way; also; they do not scale to a large number of devices becauselarge volumes of raw data are transferred regardless of the queries that are submitted. In ournew concept of sensor database system; queries dictate which data is extracted from thesensors. In this paper; we define the concept of sensor databases mixing stored datarepresented as relations and sensor data represented as time series.

Query Processing in Sensor Networks.,Yong Yao; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Hardware for sensor nodes that combine physical sensors; actuators; embeddedprocessors; and communication components has advanced significantly over the lastdecade; and made the large-scale deployment of such sensors a reality. Applications rangefrom monitoring applications such as inventory maintenance over health care to militaryapplications. In this paper; we evaluate the design of a query layer for sensor networks. Thequery layer accepts queries in a declarative language that are then optimized to generateefficient query execution plans with in-network processing which can significantly reduceresource requirements. We examine the main architectural components of such a querylayer; concentrating on in-network aggregation; interaction of in-network aggregation withthe wireless routing protocol; and distributed query processing.

Limiting privacy breaches in privacy preserving data mining,Alexandre Evfimievski; Johannes Gehrke; Ramakrishnan Srikant,Abstract There has been increasing interest in the problem of building accurate data miningmodels over aggregate data; while protecting privacy at the level of individual records. Oneapproach for this problem is to randomize the values in individual records; and only disclosethe randomized values. The model is then built over the randomized data; after firstcompensating for the randomization (at the aggregate level). This approach is potentiallyvulnerable to privacy breaches: based on the distribution of the data; one may be able tolearn with high confidence that some of the randomized records satisfy a specified property;even though privacy is preserved on average. In this paper; we present a new formulation ofprivacy breaches; together with a methodology;" amplification"; for limiting them. Unlikeearlier approaches; amplification makes it is possible to guarantee limits on privacy …,Proceedings of the twenty-second ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2003,766
Detecting change in data streams,Daniel Kifer; Shai Ben-David; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Detecting changes in a data stream is an important area of research with manyapplications. In this paper; we present a novel method for the detection and estimation ofchange. In addition to providing statistical guarantees on the reliability of detected changes;our method also provides meaningful descriptions and quantification of these changes. Ourapproach assumes that the points in the stream are independently generated; but otherwisemakes no assumptions on the nature of the generating distribution. Thus our techniqueswork for both continuous and discrete data. In an experimental study we demonstrate thepower of our techniques.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,676
Querying the physical world,Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,In the next decade; millions of sensors and small-scale mobile devices will integrateprocessors; memory; and communication capabilities. Networks of devices will be widelydeployed for monitoring applications. In these new applications; users need to query verylarge collections of devices in an ad hoc manner. Most existing systems rely on a centralizedsystem for collecting device data. These systems lack flexibility because data is extracted ina predefined way. Also; they do not scale to a large number of devices because largevolumes of raw data are transferred. In our new concept of a device database system;distributed query execution techniques are applied to leverage the computing capabilities ofdevices; and to reduce communication. We define an abstraction that allows us to representa device network as a database and we describe how distributed query processing …,IEEE personal Communications,2000,650
CACTUS—clustering categorical data using summaries,Venkatesh Ganti; Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract Clustering is an important data mining problem. Most of the earlier work onclustering focussed on numeric attributes which have a natural ordering on their attributevalues. Recently; clustering data with categorical attributes; whose attribute values do nothave a natural ordering; has received some attention. However; previous algorithms do notgive a formal description of the clusters they discover and some of them assume that theuser post-processes the output of the algorithm to identify the final clusters. In this paper; weintroduce a novel formalization of a cluster for categorical attributes by generalizing adefinition of a cluster for numerical attributes. We then describe a very fastsummarizationbased algorithm called CACTUS that discovers exactly such clusters in thedata. CACTUS has two important characteristics. First; the algorithm requires only two …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,619

A proportional share resource allocation algorithm for real-time; time-shared systems,Ion Stoica; Hussein Abdel-Wahab; Kevin Jeffay; Sanjoy K Baruah; Johannes E Gehrke; C Greg Plaxton,We propose and analyze a proportional share resource allocation algorithm for realizingreal-time performance in time-shared operating systems. Processes are assigned a weightwhich determines a share (percentage) of the resource they are to receive. The resource isthen allocated in discrete-sized time quanta in such a manner that each process makesprogress at a precise; uniform rate. Proportional share allocation algorithms are of interestbecause: they provide a natural means of seamlessly integrating real and non-real-timeprocessing; they are easy to implement; they provide a simple and effective means ofprecisely controlling the real-time performance of a process; and they provide a naturalmeans of policing so that processes that use more of a resource than they request have noill-effect on well-behaved processes.

Big data and its technical challenges,HV Jagadish; Johannes Gehrke; Alexandros Labrinidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Jignesh M Patel; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Cyrus Shahabi,The growth rate of the output of current NGS methods in terms of the raw sequence data producedby a single NGS machine is shown in Figure 1; along with the performance increase for the SPECintCPU benchmark. Clearly; the NGS sequence data growth far outstrips the performance gainsoffered by Moore's Law for single-threaded applications (here; SPECint). Note the sequencedata size in Figure 1 is the output of analyzing the raw images that are actually produced by theNGS instruments. The size of these raw image datasets themselves is so large (many TBs perlab per day) that it is impractical today to even consider storing them. Rather; these images areanalyzed on the fly to produce sequence data; which is then retained … Big Data has the potentialto revolutionize much more than just research.

Processing complex aggregate queries over data streams,Alin Dobra; Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in designing algorithms forquerying and analyzing streaming data (ie; data that is seen only once in a fixed order) withonly limited memory. Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to queries over suchcontinuous data streams is a crucial requirement for many application environments;examples include large telecom and IP network installations where performance data fromdifferent parts of the network needs to be continuously collected and analyzed. In this paper;we consider the problem of approximately answering general aggregate SQL queries overcontinuous data streams with limited memory. Our method relies on randomizing techniquesthat compute small" sketch" summaries of the streams that can then be used to provideapproximate answers to aggregate queries with provable guarantees on the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,396
On computing correlated aggregates over continual data streams,Johannes Gehrke; Flip Korn; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In many applications from telephone fraud detection to network management; dataarrives in a stream; and there is a need to maintain a variety of statistical summaryinformation about a large number of customers in an online fashion. At present; suchapplications maintain basic aggregates such as running extrema values (MIN; MAX);averages; standard deviations; etc.; that can be computed over data streams with limitedspace in a straightforward way. However; many applications require knowledge of morecomplex aggregates relating different attributes; so-called correlated aggregates. As anexample; one might be interested in computing the percentage of international phone callsthat are longer than the average duration of a domestic phone call. Exact computation of thisaggregate requires multiple passes over the data stream; which is infeasible. We propose …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,387
Expression of fatty acid sensing G-protein coupled receptors in peripartal Holstein cows,Alea Agrawal; Abdulrahman Alharthi; Mario Vailati-Riboni; Zheng Zhou; Juan J Loor,G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR); also referred as Free Fatty Acid Receptors (FFAR); arewidely studied within human medicine as drug targets for metabolic disorders. To combatmetabolic disorders prevalent in dairy cows during the transition period; which co-occur withnegative energy balance and changes to lipid and glucose metabolism; it may be helpful toidentify locations and roles of FFAR and other members of the GPCR family in bovinetissues. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) of subcutaneous adipose; liver; and PMNL samplesduring the transition period (-10;+ 7; and+ 20 or+ 30 d) were used for expression profiling ofmedium-(MCFA) and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) receptors GPR120 and GPR40; MCFAreceptor GPR84; and niacin receptor HCAR2/3.

BOAT—optimistic decision tree construction,Johannes Gehrke; Venkatesh Ganti; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Wei-Yin Loh,Abstract Classification is an important data mining problem. Given a training database ofrecords; each tagged with a class label; the goal of classification is to build a concise modelthat can be used to predict the class label of future; unlabeled records. A very popular classof classifiers are decision trees. All current algorithms to construct decision trees; includingall main-memory algorithms; make one scan over the training database per level of the tree.We introduce a new algorithm (BOAT) for decision tree construction that improves uponearlier algorithms in both performance and functionality. BOAT constructs several levels ofthe tree in only two scans over the training database; resulting in an average performancegain of 300% over previous work. The key to this performance improvement is a noveloptimistic approach to tree construction in which we construct an initial tree using a small …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,380
Privacy: Theory meets practice on the map,Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Daniel Kifer; John Abowd; Johannes Gehrke; Lars Vilhuber,Abstract In this paper; we propose the first formal privacy analysis of a data anonymizationprocess known as the synthetic data generation; a technique becoming popular in thestatistics community. The target application for this work is a mapping program that showsthe commuting patterns of the population of the United States. The source data for thisapplication were collected by the US Census Bureau; but due to privacy constraints; theycannot be used directly by the mapping program. Instead; we generate synthetic data thatstatistically mimic the original data while providing privacy guarantees. We use thesesynthetic data as a surrogate for the original data. We find that while some existingdefinitions of privacy are inapplicable to our target application; others are too conservativeand render the synthetic data useless since they guard against privacy breaches that are …,Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering,2008,365
Approximate join processing over data streams,Abhinandan Das; Johannes Gehrke; Mirek Riedewald,Abstract We consider the problem of approximating sliding window joins over data streamsin a data stream processing system with limited resources. In our model; we deal withresource constraints by shedding load in the form of dropping tuples from the data streams.We first discuss alternate architectural models for data stream join processing; and wesurvey suitable measures for the quality of an approximation of a set-valued query result. Wethen consider the number of generated result tuples as the quality measure; and we giveoptimal offline and fast online algorithms for it. In a thorough experimental study withsynthetic and real data we show the efficacy of our solutions. For applications with demandfor exact results we introduce a new Archive-metric which captures the amount of workneeded to complete the join in case the streams are archived for later processing.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,350
Rainforest-a framework for fast decision tree construction of large datasets,Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Venkatesh Ganti,Abstract Classification of large datasets is an important data mining problem. Manyclassification algorithms have been proposed in the literature; but studies have shown thatso far no algorithm uniformly outperforms all other algorithms in terms of quality. In thispaper; we present a unifying framework for decision tree classifiers that separates thescalability aspects of algorithms for constructing a decision tree from the central features thatdetermine the quality of the tree. This generic algorithm is easy to instantiate with specificalgorithms from the literature (including C4. 5; CART; CHAID; FACT; ID3 and extensions;SLIQ; Sprint and QUEST). In addition to its generality; in that it yields scalable versions of awide range of classification algorithms; our approach also offers performance improvementsof over a factor of five over the Sprint algorithm; the fastest scalable classification …,VLDB,1998,334
Differential privacy via wavelet transforms,Xiaokui Xiao; Guozhang Wang; Johannes Gehrke,Privacy-preserving data publishing has attracted considerable research interest in recentyears. Among the existing solutions;∈-differential privacy provides the strongest privacyguarantee. Existing data publishing methods that achieve∈-differential privacy; however;offer little data utility. In particular; if the output data set is used to answer count queries; thenoise in the query answers can be proportional to the number of tuples in the data; whichrenders the results useless. In this paper; we develop a data publishing technique thatensures∈-differential privacy while providing accurate answers for range-count queries; ie;count queries where the predicate on each attribute is a range. The core of our solution is aframework that applies wavelet transforms on the data before adding noise to it.

Injecting utility into anonymized datasets,Daniel Kifer; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Limiting disclosure in data publishing requires a careful balance between privacyand utility. Information about individuals must not be revealed; but a dataset should still beuseful for studying the characteristics of a population. Privacy requirements such as k-anonymity and l-diversity are designed to thwart attacks that attempt to identify individuals inthe data and to discover their sensitive information. On the other hand; the utility of such datahas not been well-studied. In this paper we will discuss the shortcomings of current heuristicapproaches to measuring utility and we will introduce a formal approach to measuring utility.Armed with this utility metric; we will show how to inject additional information into k-anonymous and l-diverse tables. This information has an intuitive semantic meaning; itincreases the utility beyond what is possible in the original k-anonymity and l-diversity …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,325
Querying and mining data streams: you only get one look a tutorial,Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Traditional Database Management Systems (DBMS) software is built on the concept ofpersistent data sets; that are stored reliably in stable storage and queried/updated severaltimes throughout their lifetime. For several emerging application domains; however; dataarrives and needs to be processed on a continuous (24 x 7) basis; without the benefit ofseveral passes over a static; persistent data image. Such continuous data streams arisenaturally; for example; in the network installations of large Telecom and Internet serviceproviders where detailed usage information (Call-Detail-Records (CDRs); SNMP/RMONpacket-flow data; etc.) from different parts of the underlying network needs to becontinuously collected and analyzed for interesting trends.

Worst-case background knowledge for privacy-preserving data publishing,David J Martin; Daniel Kifer; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke; Joseph Y Halpern,Recent work has shown the necessity of considering an attacker's background knowledgewhen reasoning about privacy in data publishing. However; in practice; the data publisherdoes not know what background knowledge the attacker possesses. Thus; it is important toconsider the worst-case. In this paper; we initiate a formal study of worst-case backgroundknowledge. We propose a language that can express any background knowledge about thedata. We provide a polynomial time algorithm to measure the amount of disclosure ofsensitive information in the worst case; given that the attacker has at most k pieces ofinformation in this language. We also provide a method to efficiently sanitize the data so thatthe amount of disclosure in the worst case is less than a specified threshold.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Towards expressive publish/subscribe systems,Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Mingsheng Hong; Mirek Riedewald; Walker White,Abstract Traditional content based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems allow users toexpress stateless subscriptions evaluated on individual events. However; many applicationssuch as monitoring RSS streams; stock tickers; or management of RFID data streams requirethe ability to handle stateful subscriptions. In this paper; we introduce Cayuga; a statefulpub/sub system based on nondeterministic finite state automata (NFA). Cayuga allows usersto express subscriptions that span multiple events; and it supports powerful languagefeatures such as parameterization and aggregation; which significantly extend theexpressive power of standard pub/sub systems. Based on a set of formally defined languageoperators; the subscription language of Cayuga provides non-ambiguous subscriptionsemantics as well as unique opportunities for optimizations.

MAFIA: A maximal frequent itemset algorithm,Douglas Burdick; Manuel Calimlim; Jason Flannick; Johannes Gehrke; Tomi Yiu,We present a new algorithm for mining maximal frequent itemsets from a transactionaldatabase. The search strategy of the algorithm integrates a depth-first traversal of the itemsetlattice with effective pruning mechanisms that significantly improve mining performance. Ourimplementation for support counting combines a vertical bitmap representation of the datawith an efficient bitmap compression scheme. In a thorough experimental analysis; weisolate the effects of individual components of MAFIA including search space pruningtechniques and adaptive compression. We also compare our performance with previouswork by running tests on very different types of data sets.

Mining very large databases,Venkatesh Ganti; Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Established companies have had decades to accumulate masses of data about theircustomers; suppliers; products and services; and employees. Data mining; also known asknowledge discovery in databases; gives organizations the tools to sift through these vastdata stores to find the trends; patterns; and correlations that can guide strategic decisionmaking. Traditionally; algorithms for data analysis assume that the input data containsrelatively few records. Current databases however; are much too large to be held in mainmemory. To be efficient; the data mining techniques applied to very large databases must behighly scalable. An algorithm is said to be scalable if (given a fixed amount of main memory);its runtime increases linearly with the number of records in the input database. Recent workhas focused on scaling data mining algorithms to very large data sets. The authors …,Computer,1999,227
Mining and monitoring evolving data,Venkatesh Ganti; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract Data mining algorithms have been the focus of much recent research. The initialspurt of research on data mining algorithms typically considered static datasets. In practice;the input data to a data mining process resides in a large data warehouse whose data iskept up-to-date through periodic or occasional insertion and deletion of sets of tuples.Consequently; several issues that arise in a dynamically evolving database have recentlybegun to receive widespread attention. In this article; we survey research on two importantissues:(1) exploiting the systematic data evolution for efficiently maintaining data miningmodels; and (2) monitoring changes in data characteristics. We classify research addressingthese two problems based on a few distinguishing characteristics; and then briefly discussall techniques captured by this classification.,*,2002,212
Dualminer: A dual-pruning algorithm for itemsets with constraints,Cristian Bucilă; Johannes Gehrke; Daniel Kifer; Walker White,Abstract Recently; constraint-based mining of itemsets for questions like “find all frequentitemsets whose total price is at least $50” has attracted much attention. Two classes ofconstraints; monotone and antimonotone; have been very useful in this area. There existalgorithms that efficiently take advantage of either one of these two classes; but no previousalgorithms can efficiently handle both types of constraints simultaneously. In this paper; wepresent DualMiner; the first algorithm that efficiently prunes its search space using bothmonotone and antimonotone constraints.

We use the data models from Oracle and StreamBase as ourexamples. Oracle uses a time-based execution model while StreamBase uses a tuple-basedexecution model. Time-based execution provides a way to model simultaneity while tuple-based execution provides a way to react to primitive events as soon as they are seen by thesystem. The result is a new model that gives the user control over the granularity at whichone can express simultaneity. Of course; it is possible to ignore simultaneity altogether. Theproposed model captures ordering and simultaneity through partial orders on batches oftuples. The batching and the ordering are encapsulated in and can be modified by means ofa powerful new operator that we call SPREAD.

Querying peer-to-peer networks using p-trees,Adina Crainiceanu; Prakash Linga; Johannes Gehrke; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,1. INTRODUCTION Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are emerging as a new paradigm for structuringlarge-scale distributed systems. The key ad- vantages of P2P networks are their scalability; theirfault- tolerance; and their robustness; due to symmetrical nature of peers and self-organizationin the face of failures. The above advantages made P2P networks suitable for content distributionand service discovery applications [1; 7; 8; 9]. However; many existing systems only supportlocation of data items based on a key value (ie equality lookups). In this paper; we argue for aricher query semantics for P2P networks. We envision a future where users will use their localservers to offer data or services described by semantically-rich XML documents. Users can thenquery this “P2P data warehouse” or ”P2P service directory” as if all the data were stored in onehuge centralized database. As a first step towards this goal we propose the P-tree; a new …,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on the Web and Databases: colocated with ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2004,2004,200
Clustering large datasets in arbitrary metric spaces,Venkatesh Ganti; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Johannes Gehrke; Allison Powell; James French,Clustering partitions a collection of objects into groups called clusters; such that similarobjects fall into the same group. Similarity between objects is defined by a distance functionsatisfying the triangle inequality; this distance function along with the collection of objectsdescribes a distance space. In a distance space; the only operation possible on data objectsis the computation of distance between them. All scalable algorithms in the literature assumea special type of distance space; namely a k-dimensional vector space; which allows vectoroperations on objects. We present two scalable algorithms designed for clustering very largedatasets in distance spaces. Our first algorithm BUBBLE is; to our knowledge; the firstscalable clustering algorithm for data in a distance space. Our second algorithm BUBBLE-FM improves upon BUBBLE by reducing the number of calls to the distance function …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference On,1999,200

Mining data streams under block evolution,Venkatesh Ganti; Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract In this paper we survey recent work on incremental data mining model maintenanceand change detection under block evolution. In block evolution; a dataset is updatedperiodically through insertions and deletions of blocks of records at a time. We describe twotechniques:(1) We describe a generic algorithm for model maintenance that takes anytraditional incremental data mining model maintenance algorithm and transforms it into analgorithm that allows restrictions on a temporal subset of the database.(2) We also describea generic framework for change detection; that quantifies the difference between twodatasets in terms of the data mining models they induce.,Acm Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2002,194
RainForest—a framework for fast decision tree construction of large datasets,Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Venkatesh Ganti,Abstract Classification of large datasets is an important data mining problem. Manyclassification algorithms have been proposed in the literature; but studies have shown thatso far no algorithm uniformly outperforms all other algorithms in terms of quality. In thispaper; we present a unifying framework called Rain Forest for classification tree constructionthat separates the scalability aspects of algorithms for constructing a tree from the centralfeatures that determine the quality of the tree. The generic algorithm is easy to instantiatewith specific split selection methods from the literature (including C4. 5; CART; CHAID;FACT; ID3 and extensions; SLIQ; SPRINT and QUEST). In addition to its generality; in that ityields scalable versions of a wide range of classification algorithms; our approach alsooffers performance improvements of over a factor of three over the SPRINT algorithm; the …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2000,193
Making Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible; Consistent when Necessary.,Cheng Li; Daniel Porto; Allen Clement; Johannes Gehrke; Nuno M Preguiça; Rodrigo Rodrigues,Abstract: Online services distribute and replicate state across geographically diverse datacenters and direct user requests to the closest or least loaded site. While effectively ensuringlow latency responses; this approach is at odds with maintaining cross-site consistency. Wemake three contributions to address this tension. First; we propose RedBlue consistency;which enables blue operations to be fast (and eventually consistent) while the remaining redoperations are strongly consistent (and slow). Second; to make use of fast operationwhenever possible and only resort to strong consistency when needed; we identifyconditions delineating when operations can be blue and must be red. Third; we introduce amethod that increases the space of potential blue operations by breaking them into separategenerator and shadow phases. We built a coordination infrastructure called Gemini that …,OSDI,2012,191
Multi-query optimization for sensor networks,Niki Trigoni; Yong Yao; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Rajmohan Rajaraman,Abstract The widespread dissemination of small-scale sensor nodes has sparked interest ina powerful new database abstraction for sensor networks: Clients “program” the sensorsthrough queries in a high-level declarative language permitting the system to perform thelow-level optimizations necessary for energy-efficient query processing. In this paper weconsider multi-query optimization for aggregate queries on sensor networks. We develop aset of distributed algorithms for processing multiple queries that incur minimumcommunication while observing the computational limitations of the sensor nodes. Ouralgorithms support incremental changes to the set of active queries and allow for localrepairs to routes in response to node failures. A thorough experimental analysis shows thatour approach results in significant energy savings; compared to previous work.,International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,2005,182

Query optimization in compressed database systems,Zhiyuan Chen; Johannes Gehrke; Flip Korn,Abstract Over the last decades; improvements in CPU speed have outpaced improvementsin main memory and disk access rates by orders of magnitude; enabling the use of datacompression techniques to improve the performance of database systems. Previous workdescribes the benefits of compression for numerical attributes; where data is stored incompressed format on disk. Despite the abundance of string-valued attributes in relationalschemas there is little work on compression for string attributes in a database context.Moreover; none of the previous work suitably addresses the role of the query optimizer:During query execution; data is either eagerly decompressed when it is read into mainmemory; or data lazily stays compressed in main memory and is decompressed on demandonly In this paper; we present an effective approach for database compression based on …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,163
A framework for measuring changes in data characteristics,Venkatesh Ganti; Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract A data mining algorithm builds a model that captures interesting aspects of theunderlying data. We develop a framework for quantifying the difference; called the deviation;between two datasets in terms of the models they induce. Our framework covers a widevariety of models including frequent itemsets; decision tree classifiers; and clusters; andcaptures standard measures of deviation such as the misclassiJication rate and the chi-squared metric as special cases. We also show how statistical techniques can be applied tothe deviation measure to assess whether the difference between two models is meaningful(ie; whether the underlying datasets have statistically significant differences in theircharacteristics); and discuss several practical applications.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,162

Inthis paper; we give an overview of our activities on energy-efficient data dissemination andquery processing.

Since we believethat no one should face a revolution without appropriate armaments; this paper presentsBUCKY; a new benchmark for object-relational database systems. BUCKY is a query-oriented benchmark that tests many of the key features offered by object-relational systems;including row types and inheritance; references and path expressions; sets of atomic valuesand of references; methods and late binding; and user-defined abstract data types and theirmethods. To test the maturity of object-relational technology relative to relational technology;we provide both an object-relational version of BUCKY and a relational equivalent thereof(ie; a relational BUCKY simulation).

Online scheduling to minimize average stretch,S Muthukrishnan; Rajmohan Rajaraman; Anthony Shaheen; Johannes E Gehrke,We consider the classical problem of online job scheduling on uniprocessor andmultiprocessor machines. For a given job; we measure the quality of service provided by analgorithm by the stretch of the job; which is defined as the ratio of the amount of time that thejob spends in the system to the processing time of the job. For a given sequence of jobs; wemeasure the performance of an algorithm by the average stretch achieved by the algorithmover all the jobs in the sequence. The average stretch metric has been used to evaluate theperformance of scheduling algorithms in many applications arising in databases; networksand systems; however no formal analysis of scheduling algorithms is known for the averagestretch metric. The main contribution of the paper is to show that the shortest remainingprocessing time algorithm (SRPT) is O (l)-competitive with respect to average stretch for …,Foundations of Computer Science; 1999. 40th Annual Symposium on,1999,118
Asynchronous Large-Scale Graph Processing Made Easy.,Guozhang Wang; Wenlei Xie; Alan J Demers; Johannes Gehrke,ABSTRACT Scaling large iterative graph processing applications through parallelcomputing is a very important problem. Several graph processing frameworks have beenproposed that insulate developers from low-level details of parallel programming. Most ofthese frameworks are based on the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model in order tosimplify application development. However; in the BSP model; vertices are processed infixed rounds; which often leads to slow convergence. Asynchronous executions cansignificantly accelerate convergence by intelligently ordering vertex updates andincorporating the most recent updates. Unfortunately; asynchronous models do not providethe programming simplicity and scalability advantages of the BSP model. In this paper; wecombine the easy programmability of the BSP model with the high performance of …,CIDR,2013,113
SECRET: a scalable linear regression tree algorithm,Alin Dobra; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Developing regression models for large datasets that are both accurate and easy tointerpret is a very important data mining problem. Regression trees with linear models in theleaves satisfy both these requirements; but thus far; no truly scalable regression treealgorithm is known. This paper proposes a novel regression tree construction algorithm(SECRET) that produces trees of high quality and scales to very large datasets. At everynode; SECRET uses the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures to find two clusters in the dataand to locally transform the regression problem into a classification problem based oncloseness to these clusters. Goodness of split measures; like the gini gain; can then be usedto determine the split variable and the split point much like in classification tree construction.Scalability of the algorithm can be achieved by employing scalable versions of the EM …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,108

iReduct: Differential privacy with reduced relative errors,Xiaokui Xiao; Gabriel Bender; Michael Hay; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Prior work in differential privacy has produced techniques for answering aggregatequeries over sensitive data in a privacy-preserving way. These techniques achieve privacyby adding noise to the query answers. Their objective is typically to minimize absolute errorswhile satisfying differential privacy. Thus; query answers are injected with noise whose scaleis independent of whether the answers are large or small. The noisy results for querieswhose true answers are small therefore tend to be dominated by noise; which leads toinferior data utility. This paper introduces iReduct; a differentially private algorithm forcomputing answers with reduced relative error. The basic idea of iReduct is to inject differentamounts of noise to different query results; so that smaller (larger) values are more likely tobe injected with less (more) noise. The algorithm is based on a novel resampling …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,106
GADT: A probability space ADT for representing and querying the physical world,Anton Faradjian; Johannes Gehrke; P Bonnett,Large sensor networks are being widely deployed for measurement; detection andmonitoring applications. Many of these applications involve database systems to store andprocess data from the physical world. This data has inherent measurement uncertainties thatare properly represented by continuous probability distribution functions (PDFs). Weintroduce a new object-relational abstract data type (ADT)-the Gaussian ADT (GADT)-thatmodels physical data as Gaussian PDFs; and we show that existing index structures can beused as fast access methods for GADT data. We also present a measurement-theoreticmodel of probabilistic data and evaluate GADT in its light.,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,103

In this paper; we propose P-Ring; a new P2P index structure thatsupports both equality and range queries. P-Ring is fault-tolerant; provides logarithmicsearch performance even for highly skewed data distributions and efficiently supports largesets of data items per peer.

Towards Statistical Queries over Distributed Private User Data.,Ruichuan Chen; Alexey Reznichenko; Paul Francis; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract To maintain the privacy of individual users' personal data; a growing number ofresearchers propose storing user data in client computers or personal data stores in thecloud; and allowing users to tightly control the release of that data. While this allows specificapplications to use certain approved user data; it precludes broad statistical analysis of userdata. Distributed differential privacy is one approach to enabling this analysis; but previousproposals are not practical in that they scale poorly; or that they require trusted clients. Thispaper proposes a design that overcomes these limitations. It places tight bounds on theextent to which malicious clients can distort answers; scales well; and tolerates churn amongclients. This paper presents a detailed design and analysis; and gives performance resultsof a complete implementation based on the deployment of over 600 clients.,NSDI,2012,95
Intelligible models for healthcare: Predicting pneumonia risk and hospital 30-day readmission,Rich Caruana; Yin Lou; Johannes Gehrke; Paul Koch; Marc Sturm; Noemie Elhadad,Abstract In machine learning often a tradeoff must be made between accuracy andintelligibility. More accurate models such as boosted trees; random forests; and neural netsusually are not intelligible; but more intelligible models such as logistic regression; naive-Bayes; and single decision trees often have significantly worse accuracy. This tradeoffsometimes limits the accuracy of models that can be applied in mission-critical applicationssuch as healthcare where being able to understand; validate; edit; and trust a learned modelis important. We present two case studies where high-performance generalized additivemodels with pairwise interactions (GA2Ms) are applied to real healthcare problems yieldingintelligible models with state-of-the-art accuracy. In the pneumonia risk prediction casestudy; the intelligible model uncovers surprising patterns in the data that previously had …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,94
Guest editors' introduction: sensor-network applications,Johannes Gehrke; Ling Liu,Moore's law indicates that the num- ber of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every 18months. In a 1997 interview; Gordon Moore illus- trated this law with a real-world compar-ison: EO Wilson; an expert on ants; estimated that the global ant population is roughly 1017 —approximately the same as the number of transistors produced in that year alone (seewww.intel.com/press room/archive/speeches/gem93097.htm). This analogy demonstrates thegrowing pervasiveness of small-scale computing devices throughout the physical world; andthe wireless sensor network commu- nity is a driving force behind this.

Cougar: the network is the database,Wai Fu Fung; David Sun; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract The widespread distribution and availability of small-scale sensors; actuators; andembedded processors is transforming the physical world into a computing platform. Onesuch example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes thatcombine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature; light; or seismic sensors withnetworking and computation capabilities [1]. Applications range from environmental control;warehouse inventory; health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assumethat the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data isaggregated and stored for offfsline querying and analysis.

Towards privacy for social networks: A zero-knowledge based definition of privacy,Johannes Gehrke; Edward Lui; Rafael Pass,Abstract We put forward a zero-knowledge based definition of privacy. Our notion is strictlystronger than the notion of differential privacy and is particularly attractive when modelingprivacy in social networks. We furthermore demonstrate that it can be meaningfully achievedfor tasks such as computing averages; fractions; histograms; and a variety of graphparameters and properties; such as average degree and distance to connectivity. Our resultsare obtained by establishing a connection between zero-knowledge privacy and samplecomplexity; and by leveraging recent sublinear time algorithms.,Theory of Cryptography Conference,2011,80
Scaling games to epic proportions,Walker White; Alan Demers; Christoph Koch; Johannes Gehrke; Rajmohan Rajagopalan,Abstract We introduce scalability for computer games as the next frontier for techniques fromdata management. A very important aspect of computer games is the artificial intelligence(AI) of non-player characters. To create interesting AI in games today; developers or playershave to create complex; dynamic behavior for a very small number of characters; but neitherthe game engines nor the style of AI programming enables intelligent behavior that scales toa very large number of non-player characters. In this paper we make a first step towards trulyscalable AI in computer games by modeling game AI as a data management problem. Wepresent a highly expressive scripting language SGL that provides game designers andplayers with a data-driven AI scheme for customizing behavior for individual non-playercharacters.

Wavescheduling: Energy-efficient data dissemination for sensor networks,Niki Trigoni; Yong Yao; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Rajmohan Rajaraman,Abstract Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for diverse monitoringapplications. Event data are collected at various sensors and sent to selected storage nodesfor further in-network processing. Since sensor nodes have strong constraints on theirenergy usage; this data transfer needs to be energy-efficient to maximize network lifetime. Inthis paper; we propose a novel methodology for trading energy versus latency in sensordatabase systems. We propose a new protocol that carefully schedules messagetransmissions so as to avoid collisions at the MAC layer. Since all nodes adhere to theschedule; their radios can be off most of the time and they only wake up during well-definedtime intervals. We show how routing protocols can be optimized to interact symbiotically withthe scheduling decisions; resulting in significant energy savings at the cost of higher …,Proceeedings of the 1st international workshop on Data management for sensor networks: in conjunction with VLDB 2004,2004,77
Maskit: Privately releasing user context streams for personalized mobile applications,Michaela Götz; Suman Nath; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract The rise of smartphones equipped with various sensors has enabledpersonalization of various applications based on user contexts extracted from sensorreadings. At the same time it has raised serious concerns about the privacy of user contexts.In this paper; we present MASKIT; a technique to filter a user context stream that provablypreserves privacy. The filtered context stream can be released to applications or be used toanswer their queries. Privacy is defined with respect to a set of sensitive contexts specifiedby the user. MASKIT limits what adversaries can learn from the filtered stream about the userbeing in a sensitive context-even if the adversaries are powerful and have knowledge aboutthe filtering system and temporal correlations in the context stream.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,76

Publishing search logs—a comparative study of privacy guarantees,Michaela Gotz; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Guozhang Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Johannes Gehrke,Search engine companies collect the “database of intentions;” the histories of their users'search queries. These search logs are a gold mine for researchers. Search enginecompanies; however; are wary of publishing search logs in order not to disclose sensitiveinformation. In this paper; we analyze algorithms for publishing frequent keywords; queries;and clicks of a search log. We first show how methods that achieve variants of k-anonymityare vulnerable to active attacks. We then demonstrate that the stronger guarantee ensuredby ε-differential privacy unfortunately does not provide any utility for this problem. We thenpropose an algorithm ZEALOUS and show how to set its parameters to achieve (ε; δ)-probabilistic privacy. We also contrast our analysis of ZEALOUS with an analysis byKorolova et al.[17] that achieves (ε'; δ')-indistinguishability.

Behavioral simulations in mapreduce,Guozhang Wang; Marcos Vaz Salles; Benjamin Sowell; Xun Wang; Tuan Cao; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Walker White,Abstract In many scientific domains; researchers are turning to large-scale behavioralsimulations to better understand real-world phenomena. While there has been a great dealof work on simulation tools from the high-performance computing community; behavioralsimulations remain challenging to program and automatically scale in parallel environments.In this paper we present BRACE (Big Red Agent-based Computation Engine); whichextends the MapReduce framework to process these simulations efficiently across a cluster.We can leverage spatial locality to treat behavioral simulations as iterated spatial joins andgreatly reduce the communication between nodes. In our experiments we achieve nearlylinear scale-up on several realistic simulations. Though processing behavioral simulationsin parallel as iterated spatial joins can be very efficient; it can be much simpler for the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,68
On the efficiency of checking perfect privacy,Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Privacy-preserving query-answering systems answer queries while provablyguaranteeing that sensitive information is kept secret. One very attractive notion of privacy isperfect privacy—a secret is expressed through a query QS; and a query QV is answeredonly if it discloses no information about the secret query Q S. However; if QS and QV arearbitrary conjunctive queries; the problem of checking whether QV discloses any informationabout QS is known to be Π p 2-complete. In this paper; we show that for large interestingsubclasses of conjunctive queries enforcing perfect privacy is tractable. Instead of givingdifferent arguments for query classes of varying complexity; we make a connection betweenperfect privacy and the problem of checking query containment. We then use this connectionto relate the complexity of enforcing perfect privacy to the complexity of query containment.,Proceedings of the twenty-fifth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2006,67
Distributed event stream processing with non-deterministic finite automata,Lars Brenna; Johannes Gehrke; Mingsheng Hong; Dag Johansen,Abstract Efficient matching of incoming events to persistent queries is fundamental to eventpattern matching; complex event processing; and publish/subscribe systems. Recentprocessing engines based on non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) have demonstratedscalability in the number of queries that can be efficiently executed on a single machine.However; existing NFA based systems are limited to processing events on a single machine.Consequently; their event processing capacity cannot be increased by adding moremachines. In this paper; we present an experimental evaluation of different methods fordistributing an event processing system that is based on NFAs across multiple machines in acluster. Our results show that careful input stream partitioning gives close to linearperformance scaleup for CPU bound workloads.,Proceedings of the Third ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2009,66

Crowd-blending privacy,Johannes Gehrke; Michael Hay; Edward Lui; Rafael Pass,Abstract We introduce a new definition of privacy called crowd-blending privacy that strictlyrelaxes the notion of differential privacy. Roughly speaking; k-crowd blending privatesanitization of a database requires that each individual i in the database “blends” with kother individuals j in the database; in the sense that the output of the sanitizer is“indistinguishable” if i's data is replaced by j's. We demonstrate crowd-blending privatemechanisms for histograms and for releasing synthetic data points; achieving strictly betterutility than what is possible using differentially private mechanisms. Additionally; wedemonstrate that if a crowd-blending private mechanism is combined with a “pre-sampling”step; where the individuals in the database are randomly drawn from some underlyingpopulation (as is often the case during data collection); then the combined mechanism …,*,2012,64

Query semantics and implementationefficiency are inherently determined by the underlying temporal model: how events aresequenced (what is the" next" event); and how the time stamp of an event is represented.Many competing temporal models for event systems have been proposed; with noconsensus on which approach is best. We take a foundational approach to this problem. Wecreate a formal framework and present event system design choices as axioms. The axiomsare grouped into standard axioms and desirable axioms. Standard axioms are common to …,Proceedings of the twenty-sixth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2007,64
Scaling mining algorithms to large databases,Paul Bradley; Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Ramakrishnan Srikant,Data mining is increasingly recognized as a key to analyzing; digesting; and understanding theflood of digital data collected by business; government; and scientific applications. Achievingthis goal requires the scaling of mining algorithms to very large databases. Many classic miningalgorithms require multiple database scans and/or random access to database records. Researchtoday focuses on overcoming limitations imposed when it is costly or impossible to scan largedatabases multiple times or access records at random; while developing innovative algorithmsand data structures to speed computation … Predictive modeling is often a high-level goal ofdata mining in practice [5]. After outlining the predictive modeling problem; we focus on two classesof algorithm: decision tree methods and support vector machines.

Identifying temporal patterns and key players in document collections,Benyah Shaparenko; Rich Caruana; Johannes Gehrke; Thorsten Joachims,Abstract This paper considers the problem of analyzing the development of a documentcollection over time without requiring meaningful citation data. Given a collection oftimestamped documents; we formulate and explore the following two questions. First; whatare the main topics and how do these topics develop over time? Second; to gain insight intothe dynamics driving this development; what are the documents and who are the authorsthat are most influential in this process? Unlike prior work in citation analysis; we proposemethods addressing these questions without requiring the availability of citation data. Themethods use only the text of the documents as input. Consequentially; they are applicable toa much wider range of document collections (email; blogs; etc.); most of which lackmeaningful citation data. We evaluate our methods on the proceedings of the Neural …,Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Temporal Data Mining: Algorithms; Theory and Applications (TDM-05),2005,60
A unified platform for data driven web applications with automatic client-server partitioning,Fan Yang; Nitin Gupta; Nicholas Gerner; Xin Qi; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Abstract Data-driven web applications are usually structured in three tiers with differentprogramming models at each tier. This division forces developers to manually partitionapplication functionality across the tiers; resulting in complex logic; suboptimal partitioning;and expensive re-partitioning of applications. In this paper; we introduce a unified platformfor automatic partitioning of data-driven web applications. Our approach is based on Hilda[41; 46]; a high-level declarative programming language with a unified data andprogramming model for all the layers of the application. Based on run-time properties of theapplication; Hilda's run time system automatically partitions the application between the tiersto improve response time while adhering to memory and/or processing constraints at theclients. We evaluate our methodology with traces from a real application and with TPC-W …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,59

Massively multi-query join processing in publish/subscribe systems,Mingsheng Hong; Alan J Demers; Johannes E Gehrke; Christoph Koch; Mirek Riedewald; Walker M White,Abstract There has been much recent interest in XML publish/subscribe systems. Somesystems scale to thousands of concurrent queries; but support a limited query language(usually a fragment of XPath 1.0). Other systems support more expressive languages; but donot scale well with the number of concurrent queries. In this paper; we propose a set of novelquery processing techniques; referred to as Massively Multi-Query Join Processingtechniques; for processing a large number of XML stream queries involving value joins overmultiple XML streams and documents. These techniques enable the sharing ofrepresentations of inputs to multiple joins; and the sharing of join computation. Ourtechniques are also applicable to relational event processing systems and publish/subscribesystems that support join queries. We present experimental results to demonstrate the …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,57
Sketch-based multi-query processing over data streams,Alin Dobra; Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in designing algorithms forquerying and analyzing streaming data (ie; data that is seen only once in a fixed order) withonly limited memory. Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to queries over suchcontinuous data streams is a crucial requirement for many application environments;examples include large telecom and IP network installations where performance data fromdifferent parts of the network needs to be continuously collected and analyzed. Randomizedtechniques; based on computing small “sketch” synopses for each stream; have recentlybeen shown to be a very effective tool for approximating the result of a single SQL queryover streaming data tuples. In this paper; we investigate the problems arising when data-stream sketches are used to process multiple such queries concurrently.

Index structures for matching XML twigs using relational query processors,Zhiyuan Chen; Johannes Gehrke; Flip Korn; Nick Koudas; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Various index structures have been proposed to speed up the evaluation of XMLpath expressions. However; existing XML path indices suffer from at least one of threelimitations: they focus only on indexing the structure (relying on a separate index for nodecontent); they are useful only for simple path expressions such as root-to-leaf paths; or theycannot be tightly integrated with a relational query processor. Moreover; there is no unifiedframework to compare these index structures. In this paper; we present a framework defininga family of index structures that includes most existing XML path indices. We also proposetwo novel index structures in this family; with different space–time tradeoffs; that are effectivefor the evaluation of XML branching path expressions (ie; twigs) with value conditions. Wealso show how this family of index structures can be implemented using the access …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,56

INTRODUCTION Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are emerging asa new paradigm for structuring large-scale distributed systems. The key ad- vantages of P2Psystems are their scalability; due to resource- sharing among peers; their fault-tolerance; dueto the sym- metrical nature of peers; and their robustness; due to self- organization in the faceof peer and network failures. Due to the above advantages; P2P systems have made inroadsfor content distribution and service discovery applications [10; 8; 9; 1].

Least expected cost query optimization: what can we expect?,Francis Chu; Joseph Halpern; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract A standard assumption in the database query optimization literature is that itsuffices to optimize for the" typical" case---that is; the case in which various parameters (eg;the amount of available memory; the selectivities of predicates; etc.) take on their" typical"values. It was claimed in [CHS99] that we could do better by choosing plans based on theirexpected cost. Here we investigate this issue more thoroughly. We show that in manycircumstances of interest; a" typical" value of the parameter often does give acceptableanswers; provided that it is chosen carefully and we are interested only in minimizingexpected running time. However; by minimizing the expected running time; we areeffectively assuming that if plan p 1 runs three times as long as plan p 2; then p 1 is exactlythree times as bad as p 2. An assumption like this is not always appropriate. We show that …,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,55
Fast checkpoint recovery algorithms for frequently consistent applications,Tuan Cao; Marcos Vaz Salles; Benjamin Sowell; Yao Yue; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Walker White,Abstract Advances in hardware have enabled many long-running applications to executeentirely in main memory. As a result; these applications have increasingly turned todatabase techniques to ensure durability in the event of a crash. However; many of theseapplications; such as massively multiplayer online games and main-memory OLTP systems;must sustain extremely high update rates-often hundreds of thousands of updates persecond. Providing durability for these applications without introducing excessive overheador latency spikes remains a challenge for application developers. In this paper; we takeadvantage of frequent points of consistency in many of these applications to develop novelcheckpoint recovery algorithms that trade additional space in main memory for significantlylower overhead and latency. Compared to previous work; our new algorithms do not …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,54
Data publishing against realistic adversaries,Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke; Michaela Götz,Abstract Privacy in data publishing has received much attention recently. The key to definingprivacy is to model knowledge of the attacker--if the attacker is assumed to know too little;the published data can be easily attacked; if the attacker is assumed to know too much; thepublished data has little utility. Previous work considered either quite ignorant adversaries ornearly omniscient adversaries. In this paper; we introduce a new class of adversaries thatwe call realistic adversaries who live in the unexplored space in between. Realisticadversaries have knowledge from external sources with an associated stubbornnessindicating the strength of their knowledge. We then introduce a novel privacy frameworkcalled epsilon-privacy that allows us to guard against realistic adversaries. We also showthat prior privacy definitions are instantiations of our framework. In a thorough …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,54
Fast iterative graph computation with block updates,Wenlei Xie; Guozhang Wang; David Bindel; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Scaling iterative graph processing applications to large graphs is an importantproblem. Performance is critical; as data scientists need to execute graph programs manytimes with varying parameters. The need for a high-level; high-performance programmingmodel has inspired much research on graph programming frameworks. In this paper; weshow that the important class of computationally light graph applications-applications thatperform little computation per vertex-has severe scalability problems across multiple coresas these applications hit an early" memory wall" that limits their speedup. We propose anovel block-oriented computation model; in which computation is iterated locally over blocksof highly connected nodes; significantly improving the amount of computation per cachemiss.

A framework for measuring differences in data characteristics,Venkatesh Ganti; Johannes Gehrke; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Wei-Yin Loh,Abstract A data mining algorithm builds a model that captures interesting aspects of theunderlying data. We develop a framework for quantifying the difference; called the deviation;between two datasets in terms of the models they induce. In addition to being a quantitative;intuitively interpretable measure of difference; the deviation between two datasets can alsobe computed very fast. Our framework covers a wide variety of models including frequentitemsets; decision tree classifiers; and clusters; and captures standard measures ofdeviation such as the misclassification rate and the chi-squared metric as special cases. Wealso show how statistical techniques can be applied to the deviation measure to assesswhether the difference between two models is significant (ie; whether the underlyingdatasets have statistically significant differences in their characteristics); and discuss …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2002,52

Method for matching XML twigs using index structures and relational query processors,*,A framework defining a family of index structures useful in evaluating XML path expressions(ie; twigs) in XML database is disclosed. Within this framework; two particular indexstructures with different space-time tradeoffs are presented that prove effective for theevaluation of twigs with value conditions. These index structures can be realized usingaccess methods of an underlying relational database system. Experimental results show thatthe indices disclosed achieve significant improvement in performance for evaluating twigqueries as compared with previously proposed XML path indices.,*,2006,48

This reportsummarizes the discussion and conclusions of the eighth such meeting; held October 14-15;2013 in Irvine; California. It observes that Big Data has now become a defining challenge ofour time; and that the database research community is uniquely positioned to address it; withenormous opportunities to make transformative impact. To do so; the report recommendssignificantly more attention to five research areas: scalable big/fast data infrastructures;coping with diversity in the data management landscape; end-to-end processing andunderstanding of data; cloud services; and managing the diverse roles of people in the datalife cycle.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2014,47
Non-tracking web analytics,Istemi Ekin Akkus; Ruichuan Chen; Michaela Hardt; Paul Francis; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Today; websites commonly use third party web analytics services t obtainaggregate information about users that visit their sites. This information includesdemographics and visits to other sites as well as user behavior within their own sites.Unfortunately; to obtain this aggregate information; web analytics services track individualuser browsing behavior across the web. This violation of user privacy has been stronglycriticized; resulting in tools that block such tracking as well as anti-tracking legislation andstandards such as Do-Not-Track. These efforts; while improving user privacy; degrade thequality of web analytics. This paper presents the first design of a system that provides webanalytics without tracking.

Intelligible models for classification and regression,Yin Lou; Rich Caruana; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Complex models for regression and classification have high accuracy; but areunfortunately no longer interpretable by users. We study the performance of generalizedadditive models (GAMs); which combine single-feature models called shape functionsthrough a linear function. Since the shape functions can be arbitrarily complex; GAMs aremore accurate than simple linear models. But since they do not contain any interactionsbetween features; they can be easily interpreted by users. We present the first large-scaleempirical comparison of existing methods for learning GAMs. Our study includes existingspline and tree-based methods for shape functions and penalized least squares; gradientboosting; and backfitting for learning GAMs. We also present a new method based on treeensembles with an adaptive number of leaves that consistently outperforms previous …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,47

Scalability for virtual worlds,Nitin Gupta; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Philipp Unterbrunner; Walker White,Networked virtual environments (net-VEs) are the next wave of digital entertainment; withMassively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs) a very popular instance. Current MMOarchitectures are server-centric in that all game logic is executed at the servers of thecompany hosting the game. This architecture has lead to severe scalability problems; inparticular since MMOs require realistic graphics and game physics–computationallyexpensive tasks that are currently computed centrally. We propose a distributed actionbased protocol for net-VEs that pushes most computation to the computers of the playersand thereby achieves massive scalability. The key feature of our proposal is a noveldistributed consistency model that allows us to explore the tradeoff between scalability;computational complexity at the server; and consistency.

A theoretical framework for learning from a pool of disparate data sources,Shai Ben-David; Johannes Gehrke; Reba Schuller,Abstract Many enterprises incorporate information gathered from a variety of data sourcesinto an integrated input for some learning task. For example; aiming towards the design ofan automated diagnostic tool for some disease; one may wish to integrate data gathered inmany different hospitals. A major obstacle to such endeavors is that different data sourcesmay vary considerably in the way they choose to represent related data. In practice; theproblem is usually solved by a manual construction of semantic mappings and translationsbetween the different sources. Recently there have been attempts to introduce automatedalgorithms based on machine learning tools for the construction of such translations. In thiswork we propose a theoretical framework for making classification predictions from acollection of different data sources; without creating explicit translations between them …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,40
An experimental analysis of iterated spatial joins in main memory,Benjamin Sowell; Marcos Vaz Salles; Tuan Cao; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Many modern applications rely on high-performance processing of spatial data.Examples include location-based services; games; virtual worlds; and scientific simulationssuch as molecular dynamics and behavioral simulations. These applications deal with largenumbers of moving objects that continuously sense their environment; and their data accesscan often be abstracted as a repeated spatial join. Updates to object positions areinterspersed with these join operations; and batched for performance. Even for the mostdemanding scenarios; the data involved in these joins fits comfortably in the main memory ofa cluster of machines; and most applications run completely in main memory forperformance reasons. Choosing appropriate spatial join algorithms is challenging due to thelarge number of techniques in the literature. In this paper; we perform an extensive …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,39
Accurate intelligible models with pairwise interactions,Yin Lou; Rich Caruana; Johannes Gehrke; Giles Hooker,Abstract Standard generalized additive models (GAMs) usually model the dependentvariable as a sum of univariate models. Although previous studies have shown that standardGAMs can be interpreted by users; their accuracy is significantly less than more complexmodels that permit interactions. In this paper; we suggest adding selected terms ofinteracting pairs of features to standard GAMs. The resulting models; which we call GA 2 {M}$-models; for Generalized Additive Models plus Interactions; consist of univariate terms anda small number of pairwise interaction terms. Since these models only include one-and two-dimensional components; the components of GA 2 M-models can be visualized andinterpreted by users.

Rule-based multi-query optimization,Mingsheng Hong; Mirek Riedewald; Christoph Koch; Johannes Gehrke; Alan Demers,Abstract Data stream management systems usually have to process many long-runningqueries that are active at the same time. Multiple queries can be evaluated more efficientlytogether than independently; because it is often possible to share state and computation.Motivated by this observation; various Multi-Query Optimization (MQO) techniques havebeen proposed. However; these approaches suffer from two limitations. First; they focus onvery specialized workloads. Second; integrating MQO techniques for CQL-style streamengines and those for event pattern detection engines is even harder; as the processingmodels of these two types of stream engines are radically different. In this paper; we proposea rule-based MQO framework.

Approximation techniques for spatial data,Abhinandan Das; Johannes Gehrke; Mirek Riedewald,Abstract Spatial Database Management Systems (SDBMS); eg; Geographical InformationSystems; that manage spatial objects such as points; lines; and hyper-rectangles; often havevery high query processing costs. Accurate selectivity estimation during query optimizationtherefore is crucially important for finding good query plans; especially when spatial joinsare involved. Selectivity estimation has been studied for relational database systems; but todate has only received little attention in SDBMS. In this paper; we introduce novel methodsthat permit high-quality selectivity estimation for spatial joins and range queries. Ourtechniques can be constructed in a single scan over the input; handle inserts and deletes tothe database incrementally; and hence they can also be used for processing of streamingspatial data.

Efficient approximation of correlated sums on data streams,Rohit Ananthakrishna; Abhinandan Das; Johannes Gehrke; Flip Korn; S Muthukrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,In many applications such as IP network management; data arrives in streams and queriesover those streams need to be processed online using limited storage. Correlated-sum (CS)aggregates are a natural class of queries formed by composing basic aggregates on (x; y)pairs and are of the form SUM {g (y): x/spl les/f (AGG (x))}; where AGG (x) can be any basicaggregate and f (); g () are user-specified functions. CS-aggregates cannot be computedexactly in one pass through a data stream using limited storage; hence; we study theproblem of computing approximate CS-aggregates. We guarantee a priori error boundswhen AGG (x) can be computed in limited space (eg; MIN; MAX; AVG); using two variants ofGreenwald and Khanna's summary structure for the approximate computation of quantiles.Using real data sets; we experimentally demonstrate that an adaptation of the quantile …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,35
Better scripts; better games,Walker White; Christoph Koch; Johannes Gehrke; Alan Demers,The video game industry earned $8.85 billion in revenue in 2007; almost as much as moviesmade at the box office.

Matchminer: Efficient spanning structure mining in large image collections,Yin Lou; Noah Snavely; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Many new computer vision applications are utilizing large-scale data-sets of placesderived from the many billions of photos on the Web. Such applications often requireknowledge of the visual connectivity structure of these image collections—describing whichimages overlap or are otherwise related—and an important step in understanding thisstructure is to identify connected components of this underlying image graph. As thestructure of this graph is often initially unknown; this problem can be posed as one ofexploring the connectivity between images as quickly as possible; by intelligently selecting asubset of image pairs for feature matching and geometric verification; without having to testall O (n 2) possible pairs. We propose a novel; scalable algorithm called MatchMiner thatefficiently explores visual relations between images; incorporating ideas from relevance …,*,2012,33
How to quickly find a witness,Daniel Kifer; Johannes Gehrke; Cristian Bucila; Walker White,Abstract The subfield of itemset mining is essentially a collection of algorithms. Whenever anew type of constraint is discovered; a specialized algorithm is proposed to handle it. All ofthese algorithms are highly tuned to take advantage of the unique properties of theirassociated constraints; and so they are not very compatible with other constraints. Wepresent a more unified view of mining constrained itemsets such that most existingalgorithms can be easily extended to handle constraints for which they were not designed a-priori. We apply this technique to mining itemsets with restrictions on their variance—aproblem that has been open for several years in the data mining community.,*,2006,32
The homeostasis protocol: Avoiding transaction coordination through program analysis,Sudip Roy; Lucja Kot; Gabriel Bender; Bailu Ding; Hossein Hojjat; Christoph Koch; Nate Foster; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Datastores today rely on distribution and replication to achieve improvedperformance and fault-tolerance. But correctness of many applications depends on strongconsistency properties--something that can impose substantial overheads; since it requirescoordinating the behavior of multiple nodes. This paper describes a new approach toachieving strong consistency in distributed systems while minimizing communicationbetween nodes. The key insight is to allow the state of the system to be inconsistent duringexecution; as long as this inconsistency is bounded and does not affect transactioncorrectness. In contrast to previous work; our approach uses program analysis to extractsemantic information about permissible levels of inconsistency and is fully automated.

Guaranteeing correctness and availability in p2p range indices,Prakash Linga; Adina Crainiceanu; Johannes Gehrke; Jayavel Shanmugasudaram,Abstract New and emerging P2P applications require sophisticated range query capabilityand also have strict requirements on query correctness; system availability and itemavailability. While there has been recent work on developing new P2P range indices; noneof these indices guarantee correctness and availability. In this paper; we develop newtechniques that can provably guarantee the correctness and availability of P2P rangeindices. We develop our techniques in the context of a general P2P indexing framework thatcan be instantiated with most P2P index structures from the literature.

Query processing in a device database system,Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Tobias Mayr; Praveen Seshadri,In the next decade; networks of devices will be widely deployed for measurement; detectionand surveillance applications. Millions of sensors and small-scale mobile devices willintegrate processors; memory and communication capabilities. Large collections of devicesneed to be controlled and accessed in an ad-hoc manner. This paper shows that databasetechnology can be adapted to meet the challenges of this new computing environment. Inour new concept of a device database system; individual devices are modeled as databaseobjects; which allows us to access collections of devices with declarative queries. Wepresent a semantics for queries over device database systems and novel query processingtechniques for evaluating such queries. We describe our implementation of thesetechniques in the Cornell COUGAR system and present a experimental evaluation that …,*,1999,31
ATLAS: a probabilistic algorithm for high dimensional similarity search,Jiaqi Zhai; Yin Lou; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Given a set of high dimensional binary vectors and a similarity function (such asJaccard and Cosine); we study the problem of finding all pairs of vectors whose similarityexceeds a given threshold. The solution to this problem is a key component in manyapplications with feature-rich objects; such as text; images; music; videos; or socialnetworks. In particular; there are many important emerging applications that require the useof relatively low similarity thresholds. We propose ATLAS; a probabilistic similarity searchalgorithm that in expectation finds a 1-δ fraction of all similar vector pairs. ATLAS uses trulyrandom permutations both to filter candidate pairs of vectors and to estimate the similaritybetween vectors. At a 97.5% recall rate; ATLAS consistently outperforms all state-of-the-artapproaches and achieves a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude over both exact …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,29
Method and system for efficient and expressive advertising auctions,*,A system and method for allowing advertisers to express bids as bidding programs that takeas input; for example; a search query and various statistics about auction history andperformance; for outputting bids on output characteristics such as; for example; clicks;purchases; and slot positions; and for providing an efficient; scalable; and parallelizablealgorithm to solve winner determination given the bids output by the bidding programs.,*,2010,28
Online scheduling to minimize average stretch,S Muthukrishnan; Rajmohan Rajaraman; Anthony Shaheen; Johannes E Gehrke,We consider the classical problem of online job scheduling on uniprocessor andmultiprocessor machines. For a given job; we measure the quality of service provided by analgorithm by the stretch of the job; which is defined as the ratio of the amount of time that thejob spends in the system to the processing time of the job. For a given sequence of jobs; wemeasure the performance of an algorithm by the average stretch achieved by the algorithmover all the jobs in the sequence. The average stretch metric has been used to evaluate theperformance of scheduling algorithms in many applications arising in databases; networks;and systems. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the shortest remainingprocessing time (SRPT) algorithm is O (1)-competitive with respect to average stretch forboth uniprocessors and multiprocessors. For uniprocessors; we prove that SRPT is 2 …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2005,28
Privacy in search logs,Michaela Götz; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Guozhang Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract: Search engine companies collect the" database of intentions"; the histories of theirusers' search queries. These search logs are a gold mine for researchers. Search enginecompanies; however; are wary of publishing search logs in order not to disclose sensitiveinformation. In this paper we analyze algorithms for publishing frequent keywords; queriesand clicks of a search log. We first show how methods that achieve variants of $ k $-anonymity are vulnerable to active attacks. We then demonstrate that the stronger guaranteeensured by $\epsilon $-differential privacy unfortunately does not provide any utility for thisproblem. We then propose an algorithm ZEALOUS and show how to set its parameters toachieve $(\epsilon;\delta) $-probabilistic privacy. We also contrast our analysis of ZEALOUSwith an analysis by Korolova et al.[17] that achieves $(\epsilon';\delta') …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0904.0682,2009,27
Semantic approximation of data stream joins,Abhinandan Das; Johannes Gehrke; Mirek Riedewald,We consider the problem of approximating sliding window joins over data streams in a datastream processing system with limited resources. In our model; we deal with resourceconstraints by shedding load in the form of dropping tuples from the data streams. We maketwo main contributions. First; we define the problem space by discussing architecturalmodels for data stream join processing and surveying suitable measures for the quality of anapproximation of a set-valued query result. Second; we examine in detail a large part of thisproblem space. More precisely; we consider the number of generated result tuples as thequality measure and we propose optimal offline and fast online algorithms for it. In athorough experimental study with synthetic and real data; we show the efficacy of oursolutions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,27
P-ring: An index structure for peer-to-peer systems,Adina Crainiceanu; Prakash Linga; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Current peer-to-peer (P2P) index structures only support a subset of the desired functionalityfor P2P database systems. For instance; some P2P index structures support equality queriesbut not range queries; while others support range queries; but do not support multiple dataitems per peer or provide guaranteed search performance. In this paper; we devise a novelindex structure called P-Ring that supports both equality and range queries; is fault-tolerant;provides guaranteed search performance; and efficiently supports large sets of data itemsper peer. We are not aware of any other existing index structure that supports all of theabove functionality in a dynamic P2P environment. In a thorough experimental study weevaluate the performance of P-Ring and quantify the performance trade-offs of the differentsystem components. We also compare P-Ring with two other P2P index structures; Skip …,*,2004,27
ClouDiA: a deployment advisor for public clouds,Tao Zou; Ronan Le Bras; Marcos Vaz Salles; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract An increasing number of distributed data-driven applications are moving intoshared public clouds. By sharing resources and operating at scale; public clouds promisehigher utilization and lower costs than private clusters. To achieve high utilization; however;cloud providers inevitably allocate virtual machine instances noncontiguously; ie; instancesof a given application may end up in physically distant machines in the cloud. This allocationstrategy can lead to large differences in average latency between instances. For a largeclass of applications; this difference can result in significant performance degradation;unless care is taken in how application components are mapped to instances. In this paper;we propose ClouDiA; a general deployment advisor that selects application nodedeployments minimizing either (i) the largest latency between application nodes; or (ii) …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,25

Making time-stepped applications tick in the cloud,Tao Zou; Guozhang Wang; Marcos Vaz Salles; David Bindel; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Walker White,Abstract Scientists are currently evaluating the cloud as a new platform. Many importantscientific applications; however; perform poorly in the cloud. These applications proceed inhighly parallel discrete time-steps or" ticks;" using logical synchronization barriers at tickboundaries. We observe that network jitter in the cloud can severely increase the timerequired for communication in these applications; significantly increasing overall runningtime. In this paper; we propose a general parallel framework to process time-steppedapplications in the cloud. Our framework exposes a high-level; data-centric programmingmodel which represents application state as tables and dependencies between states asqueries over these tables. We design a jitter-tolerant runtime that uses these datadependencies to absorb latency spikes by (1) carefully scheduling computation and (2) …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2011,24
Wave scheduling and routing in sensor networks,Niki Trigoni; Yong Yao; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Rajmohan Rajaraman,Abstract Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for diverse monitoringapplications. Event data are collected at various sensors and sent to selected storage nodesfor further in-network processing. Since sensor nodes have strong constraints on theirenergy usage; this data transfer needs to be energy-efficient to maximize network lifetime. Inthis article; we propose a novel methodology for trading energy versus latency in sensordatabase systems. We propose a new protocol that carefully schedules messagetransmissions so as to avoid collisions at the MAC layer. Since all nodes adhere to theschedule; their radios can be off most of the time and only wake up during well-defined timeintervals. We show how routing protocols can be optimized to interact symbiotically withscheduling decisions; resulting in significant energy savings at the cost of higher latency …,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN),2007,23

A general algebra and implementation for monitoring event streams,Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Mingsheng Hong; Mirek Riedewald; Walker White,Recently there has been considerable research on Data Stream Management Systems(DSMS) to support analysis of data that arrives rapidly in high-speed streams. Most of thesesystems have very expressive query languages in order to address a wide range ofapplications. In this paper; we take a different approach. Instead of starting with a verypowerful data stream query language; we begin with a well-known class of languages--event languages. Through the addition of several simple; but powerful language constructs(namely parameterization and aggregates); we add pieces that extend their expressivenesstowards full-fledged languages for processing data streams. Our resulting contributions area novel algebra for expressing data stream queries; and a corresponding transformation ofalgebra expressions into finite state automata that can be implemented very efficiently …,*,2005,22

An evaluation of checkpoint recovery for massively multiplayer online games,Marcos Vaz Salles; Tuan Cao; Benjamin Sowell; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Christoph Koch; Walker White,Abstract Massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) have emerged as an exciting newclass of applications for database technology. MMOs simulate long-lived; interactive virtualworlds; which proceed by applying updates in frames or ticks; typically at 30 or 60 Hz. Inorder to sustain the resulting high update rates of such games; game state is kept entirely inmain memory by the game servers. Nevertheless; durability in MMOs is usually achieved bya standard DBMS implementing ARIES-style recovery. This architecture limits scalability;forcing MMO developers to either invest in high-end hardware or to over-partition their virtualworlds. In this paper; we evaluate the applicability of existing checkpoint recoverytechniques developed for main-memory DBMS to MMO workloads.

Entangled queries: enabling declarative data-driven coordination,Nitin Gupta; Lucja Kot; Sudip Roy; Gabriel Bender; Johannes Gehrke; Christoph Koch,Abstract Many data-driven social and Web applications involve collaboration andcoordination. The vision of Declarative Data-Driven Coordination (D3C); proposed in Kot etal.[2010]; is to support coordination in the spirit of data management: to make it data-centricand to specify it using convenient declarative languages. This article introduces entangledqueries; a language that extends SQL by constraints that allow for the coordinated choice ofresult tuples across queries originating from different users or applications. It is nontrivial todefine a declarative coordination formalism without arriving at the general (NP-complete)Constraint Satisfaction Problem from AI. In this article; we propose an efficiently enforceablesyntactic safety condition that we argue is at the sweet spot where interesting declarativepower meets applicability in large-scale data management systems and applications.

Explainable security for relational databases,Gabriel Bender; Lucja Kot; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Companies and organizations collect and use vast troves of sensitive user datawhose release must be carefully controlled. In practice; the access policies that govern thisdata are often fine-grained; complex; poorly documented; and difficult to reason about. As aresult; principals frequently request and are granted access to data they never use. Toencourage developers and administrators to use security mechanisms more effectively; wepropose a novel security model in which all security decisions are formally explainable.Whether a query is accepted or denied; the system returns a concise yet formal explanationwhich can allow the issuer to reformulate a rejected query or adjust his/her securitycredentials. Our approach has a strong formal foundation based on previously unexploredconnections between disclosure lattices and policy algebras.

We can study census data to learnwhere to allocate public resources; medical records from hospitals to fight diseases; or dataabout students and teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to learningand teaching. In all of these scenarios; we need to limit statistical disclosure: we want torelease accurate statistics about the data while preserving the privacy of the individuals whocontributed it.

Declarative processing for computer games,Walker White; Benjamin Sowell; Johannes Gehrke; Alan Demers,Abstract Most game developers think of databases as nothing more than a persistencesolution. However; database research is concerned with the wider problem of declarativeprocessing. In this paper we demonstrate how declarative processing can be applied tocomputer games. We introduce the state-effect pattern; a design pattern that allows gamedevelopers to design parts of their game declaratively. We present SGL; a special scriptinglanguage which supports this design pattern and which can be compiled to a declarativelanguage like SQL. We show how database techniques can process this design pattern in away that improves performance by an order of magnitude or more. Finally; we discuss somedesign decisions that developers must make in order to adopt this pattern effectively.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGGRAPH symposium on Video games,2008,16
An indexing framework for peer-to-peer systems,Adina Crainiceanu; Prakash Linga; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Current peer-to-peer (P2P) indices are monolithic pieces of software that address only asubset of the desired functionality for P2P databases. For instance; Chord [6] providesreliability and scalability; but only supports equality queries. Skip Graphs [1] support equalityand range queries; but only for one data item per peer. PePeR [4] supports equality andrange queries over multiple data items per peer; but does not provide any search orreliability guarantees in face of multiple failures. Galanis et al.[5] describe an index structurefor locating XML documents; but this index does not provide any provable guarantees onsize and performance. In a P2P database system; all of the above functionality is required;but none of the existing systems supports it.

Toward expressive and scalable sponsored search auctions,David J Martin; Johannes Gehrke; Joseph Y Halpern,Internet search results are a growing and highly profitable advertising platform. Searchproviders auction advertising slots to advertisers on their search result pages. Due to thehigh volume of searches and the users' low tolerance for search result latency; it isimperative to resolve these auctions fast. Current approaches restrict the expressiveness ofbids in order to achieve fast winner determination; which is the problem of allocating slots toadvertisers so as to maximize the expected revenue given the advertisers' bids. The goal ofour work is to permit more expressive bidding; thus allowing advertisers to achieve complexadvertising goals; while still providing fast and scalable techniques for winner determination.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Beyond isolation: Research opportunities in declarative data-driven coordination,Lucja Kot; Nitin Gupta; Sudip Roy; Johannes Gehrke; Christoph Koch,Abstract There are many database applications that require users to coordinate andcommunicate. Friends want to coordinate travel plans; students want to jointly enroll in thesame set of courses; and busy professionals want to coordinate their schedules. These tasksare difficult to program using existing abstractions provided by database systems because inaddition to the traditional ACID properties provided by the system they all require some typeof coordination between users. This is fundamentally incompatible with isolation in theclassical ACID properties. In this position paper; we argue that it is time for the databasecommunity to look beyond isolation towards principled and elegant abstractions that allowfor communication and coordination between some notion of (suitably generalized)transactions.

Search in social networks with access control,Truls A Bjørklund; Michaela Götz; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract More and more important data is accumulated inside social networks. Limiting theflow of private information across a social network is very important; and most socialnetworks provide sophisticated privacy settings to control this flow. Creating such extensiveaccess control knobs makes the search for content a hard problem since each user sees aunique subset of all the data. In this work; we take a first step at integrating access controlbased on a social network in a search system. We describe a set of solutions to the problem;including what indexes to construct and how to filter out inaccessible results. Anexperimental analysis illustrates the tradeoffs of the various strategies; and we point out aset of interesting future research directions in this area.,Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Keyword Search on Structured Data,2010,13

Sparse partially linear additive models,Yin Lou; Jacob Bien; Rich Caruana; Johannes Gehrke,The generalized partially linear additive model (GPLAM) is a flexible and interpretableapproach to building predictive models. It combines features in an additive manner; allowingeach to have either a linear or nonlinear effect on the response. However; the choice ofwhich features to treat as linear or nonlinear is typically assumed known. Thus; to make aGPLAM a viable approach in situations in which little is known a priori about the features;one must overcome two primary model selection challenges: deciding which features toinclude in the model and determining which of these features to treat nonlinearly. Weintroduce the sparse partially linear additive model (SPLAM); which combines model fittingand both of these model selection challenges into a single convex optimization problem.SPLAM provides a bridge between the lasso and sparse additive models.

To personalize PageRank; one adjusts node weights oredge weights that determine teleport probabilities and transition probabilities in a randomsurfer model. There are many fast methods to approximate PageRank when the nodeweights are personalized; however; personalization based on edge weights has been anopen problem since the dawn of personalized PageRank over a decade ago. In this paper;we describe the first fast algorithm for computing PageRank on general graphs when theedge weights are personalized.

Nevertheless; up to this point very little attention has been paid toproperly evaluating such index structures; with most previous work relying solely onrandomly selected data series to use as queries (with/without adding noise).

Better scripts; better games,Walker White; Christoph Koch; Johannes Gehrke; Alan Demers,Abstract The video game industry earned $8.85 billion in revenue in 2007; almost as muchas movies made at the box office. Much of this revenue was generated by blockbuster titlescreated by large groups of people. Though large development teams are not unheard of inthe software industry; game studios tend to have unique collections of developers. Softwareengineers make up a relatively small portion of the game development team; while themajority of the team consists of content creators such as artists; musicians; and designers.,Queue,2008,10
Rapid convergence of a local load balancing algorithm for asynchronous rings,Johannes E Gehrke; C Greg Plaxton; Rajmohan Rajaraman,Abstract We consider the problem of load balancing in a ring network. We present ananalysis of the following local algorithm. In each step; each node of the ring examines thenumber of tokens at its clockwise neighbor and sends a token to the neighbour if theneighbour has fewer tokens. We show that in a synchronous model; for any initial tokendistribution b on an n-node ring; the algorithm converges to a completely balanceddistribution within 4OPT (b)+ n steps; where OPT (b) is the time taken by the optimalcentralized algorithm to balance b completely. Our main result is an analysis of the algorithmin an asynchronous model in which local computations and messages may be arbitrarilydelayed; subject to the constraint that each message is eventually delivered and eachcomputation is eventually performed. By generalizing our analysis for the synchronous …,Theoretical Computer Science,1999,9

Sketch-based multi-query processing over data streams,*,A method of efficiently providing estimated answers to workloads of aggregate; multi-joinSQL-like queries over a number of input data-streams. The method only examines each dataelements once and uses a limited amount of computer memory. The method uses joingraphs and atomic sketches that are essentially pseudo-random summaries formed usingrandom binary variables. The estimated answer is the product of all the atomic sketches forall the vertices in the query join graph. A query workload is processed efficiently byidentifying and sharing atomic sketches common to distinct queries; while ensuring that thejoin graphs remain well formed. The method may automatically minimize either the averagequery error or the maximum query error over the workload.,*,2008,8

Guardat: Enforcing data policies at the storage layer,Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner; Eslam Elnikety; Aastha Mehta; Deepak Garg; Peter Druschel; Rodrigo Rodrigues; Johannes Gehrke; Ansley Post,Abstract In today's data processing systems; both the policies protecting stored data and themechanisms for their enforcement are spread over many software components andconfiguration files; increasing the risk of policy violation due to bugs; vulnerabilities andmisconfigurations. Guardat addresses this problem. Users; developers and administratorsspecify file protection policies declaratively; concisely and separate from code; and Guardatenforces these policies by mediating I/O in the storage layer. Policy enforcement relies onlyon the integrity of the Guardat controller and any external policy dependencies. Thesemantic gap between the storage layer enforcement and per-file policies is bridged usingcryptographic attestations from Guardat.

Writes that fall in the forest and make no sound: Semantics-based adaptive data consistency,Sudip Roy; Lucja Kot; Nate Foster; Johannes Gehrke; Hossein Hojjat; Christoph Koch,ABSTRACT Datastores today rely on distribution and replication to achieve improvedperformance and fault-tolerance. But the correctness of many applications depends onstrong consistency properties—something that can impose substantial overheads; since itrequires coordinating the behavior of multiple nodes. This paper describes a new approachto achieving strong consistency in distributed systems while minimizing communicationbetween nodes. The key insight is to allow the state of the system to be inconsistent duringexecution; as long as this inconsistency is bounded and does not affect transactioncorrectness. In contrast to previous work; our approach uses program analysis to extractsemantic information about permissible levels of inconsistency and is fully automated. Wethen employ a novel homeostasis protocol to allow sites to operate independently …,CoRR; abs/1403.2307,2014,7
Beyond myopic inference in big data pipelines,Karthik Raman; Adith Swaminathan; Johannes Gehrke; Thorsten Joachims,Abstract Big Data Pipelines decompose complex analyses of large data sets into a series ofsimpler tasks; with independently tuned components for each task. This modular setupallows re-use of components across several different pipelines. However; the interaction ofindependently tuned pipeline components yields poor end-to-end performance as errorsintroduced by one component cascade through the whole pipeline; affecting overallaccuracy. We propose a novel model for reasoning across components of Big DataPipelines in a probabilistically well-founded manner. Our key idea is to view the interactionof components as dependencies on an underlying graphical model. Different messagepassing schemes on this graphical model provide various inference algorithms to trade-offend-to-end performance and computational cost.

In this paper; we investigate the problemsarising when data-stream sketches are used to process multiple such queries concurrently.We demonstrate that; in the presence of multiple query expressions; intelligently sharingsketches among concurrent query evaluations can result in substantial improvements in theutilization of the available sketching space and the quality of the resulting approximationerror guarantees.

Classification and Regression Trees.,Johannes Gehrke,It is the goal of classification and regression to build a data mining model that can be usedfor prediction. To construct such a model; we are given a set of training records; each havingseveral attributes. These attributes can either be numerical (for example; age or salary) orcategorical (for example; profession or gender). There is one distinguished attribute; thedependent attribute; the other attributes are called predictor attributes. If the dependentattribute is categorical; the problem is a classification problem. If the dependent attribute isnumerical; the problem is a regression problem. It is the goal of classification and regressionto construct a data mining model that predicts the (unknown) value for a record where thevalue of the dependent attribute is unknown.(We call such a record an unlabeled record.)Classification and regression have a wide range of applications; including scientific …,*,2009,7

Indexing for function approximation,Biswanath Panda; Mirek Riedewald; Stephen B Pope; Johannes Gehrke; L Paul Chew,Abstract Simulation is one of the most powerful tools that scientists have at their disposal forstudying and understanding real-world physical phenomena. In order to be realistic; themathematical models which drive simulations are often very complex and run for a verylarge number of simulation steps. The required computational resources often make itinfeasible to evaluate simulation models exactly at each step; and thus scientists tradeaccuracy for reduced simulation cost. In this paper; we explore function approximation for acombustion simulation. In particular; we model high-dimensional function approximation(HFA) as a storage and retrieval problem; and we show that HFA defines a novel class ofapplications for high dimensional index structures. The interesting property of HFA is that itimposes a mixed query/update workload on the index which leads to novel tradeoffs …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,7

Consequently; the application developer is forced to partition theapplication code between the server and client at the time of writing the application.However; the partitioning of the code between the client and server may have to be changedduring the evolution of the application for performance reasons (it may be better to pushmore functionality to the client); for correctness reasons (data that conflicts with multipleclients cannot always be pushed to clients); and for supporting clients with differentcomputing power (browsers on desktops vs. PDAs).

Leveraging non-uniform resources for parallel query processing,Tobias Mayr; Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,Modular clusters are now composed of nonuniform nodes with different CPUs; disks ornetwork cards so that customers can adapt the cluster configuration to the changingtechnologies and to their changing needs. This challenges dataflow parallelism as theprimary load balancing technique of existing parallel database systems. We show in thispaper that dataflow parallelism alone is ill suited for modular clusters because running thesame operation on different subsets of the data can not fully utilize non-uniform hardwareresources. We propose and evaluate new load balancing techniques that blend pipelineparallelism with data parallelism. We consider relational operators as pipelines of fine-grained operations that can be located on different cluster nodes and executed in parallel ondifferent data subsets to best exploit non-uniform resources.

Fine-grained disclosure control for app ecosystems,Gabriel M Bender; Lucja Kot; Johannes Gehrke; Christoph Koch,Abstract The modern computing landscape contains an increasing number of appecosystems; where users store personal data on platforms such as Facebook orsmartphones. APIs enable third-party applications (apps) to utilize that data. A key concernassociated with app ecosystems is the confidentiality of user data. In this paper; we developa new model of disclosure in app ecosystems. In contrast with previous solutions; our modelis data-derived and semantically meaningful. Information disclosure is modeled in terms of aset of distinguished security views. Each query is labeled with the precise set of securityviews that is needed to answer it; and these labels drive policy decisions.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,6

Geo-replication: Fast if possible; consistent if necessary,Valter Balegas; Cheng Li; Mahsa Najafzadeh; Daniel Porto; Allen Clement; Sérgio Duarte; Carla Ferreira; Johannes Gehrke; Joao Leitao; Nuno Preguiça; Rodrigo Rodrigues; Marc Shapiro; Viktor Vafeiadis,Geo-replicated storage systems are at the core of current Internet services. Unfortunately;there exists a fundamental tension between consistency and performance for offeringscalable geo-replication. Weakening consistency semantics leads to less coordination andconsequently a good user experience; but it may introduce anomalies such as statedivergence and invariant violation. In contrast; maintaining stronger consistency precludesanomalies but requires more coordination. This paper discusses two main contributions toaddress this tension. First; RedBlue Consistency enables blue operations to be fast (andweakly consistent) while the remaining red operations are strongly consistent (and slow).We identify sufficient conditions for determining when operations can be blue or must be red.Second; Explicit Consistency further increases the space of operations that can be fast by …,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2016,5

ClouDiA: a deployment advisor for public clouds,Tao Zou; Ronan Le Bras; Marcos Vaz Salles; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract An increasing number of distributed data-driven applications are moving intoshared public clouds. By sharing resources and operating at scale; public clouds promisehigher utilization and lower costs than private clusters. To achieve high utilization; however;cloud providers inevitably allocate virtual machine instances non-contiguously; ie; instancesof a given application may end-up in physically distant machines in the cloud. This allocationstrategy can lead to large differences in average latency between instances. For a largeclass of applications; this difference can result in significant performance degradation;unless care is taken in how application components are mapped to instances.

Scheduling to Minimize Average Stretch,J Gehrke; S Muthukrishnan; Rajmohan Rajaraman; Anthony Shaheen,ABSTRACT We consider the classical problem of online preemptive job scheduling onuniprocessor and multiprocessor machines. For a given job; we measure the quality ofservice provided by an algorithm by the stretch of the job; which is defined as the ratio of theamount of time that the job spends in the system to the processing time of the job. For agiven sequence of jobs; we measure the performance of an algorithm by the average stretchachieved by the algorithm over all the jobs in the sequence. We first prove that no on-linealgorithm can achieve a competitive ratio that is smaller than 1: 03. The main contribution ofthis paper is to show that the shortest remaining processing time algorithm (SRPT) is O (1)-competitive with respect to average stretch for both uniprocessors as well asmultiprocessors. For uniprocessors; we prove that SRPT is 2-competitive. We also …,*,1999,4
Intelligible models for classification and regression,Rich Caruana; Yin Lou; Johannes Gehrke,The most accurate supervised learning methods for many problems are complex modelssuch as boosted trees; SVMs with RBF kernels; or deep neural nets. In many applications;however; what is learned is just as important as model accuracy. Unfortunately; the highaccuracy of complex models usually comes at the expense of interpretability. The goal of thiswork is to construct models that are as accurate as possible while retaining interpretability.Interpretability is not easy to define. Here we mean that users can understand thecontribution of individual features in the model. This desiderata permits arbitrary complexrelationships between individual features and the target; but excludes models with complexinteractions between features. Thus we are interested in generalized additive models [3; 4]of the form: g (y)= f1 (x1)+...+ fn (xn);(1) The function g (·) is called the link function and fis …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Coordination through querying in the Youtopia system,Nitin Gupta; Lucja Kot; Gabriel Bender; Sudip Roy; Johannes Gehrke; Christoph Koch,Abstract In a previous paper; we laid out the vision of declarative data-driven coordination(D3C) where users are provided with novel abstractions that enable them to communicateand coordinate through declarative specifications [3]. In this demo; we will show Youtopia; anovel database system which is our first attempt at implementing this vision. Youtopiaprovides coordination abstractions within the DBMS. Users submit queries that come withexplicit coordination constraints to be met by other queries in the system. Such queries areevaluated together; the system ensures that their joint execution results in the satisfaction ofall coordination constraints. That is; the queries coordinate their answers in the mannerspecified by the users.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,3

What's" Next"?,Walker White; Mirek Riedewald; Johannes Gehrke; Alan Demers,Event processing systems have wide applications ranging from monitoring RSS feeds tomanaging events from RFID readers; and there exists much work on them in the literature.Many competing temporal models for event systems have been proposed; with noconsensus on which approach is best. In this paper we determine the important propertiesfor such temporal models. Our approach is to define a very general temporal model capableof representing time in all of the major event systems. We introduce axioms motivated by thetime stamp ordering relation and the semantics of the successor operator; which is presentin all event systems. Only two of our axioms are controversial; the remaining axioms aresatisfied by all event systems. We consider the temporal models obtained using our full setof axioms; and the models that result when one or the other of our controversial axioms is …,*,2006,3

Query processing with heterogeneous resources,Tobias Mayr; Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke; Praveen Seshadri,In emerging systems; CPUs and memory are integrated into active disks; controllers; andnetwork interconnects. Query processing on these new multiprocessor systems mustconsider the heterogeneity of resources among the components. This leads to the moregeneral problem of how to deal with performance heterogeneity in parallel databasesystems. We study database query processing techniques that increase the leverage ofheterogeneous resources. We show that the traditional algorithms used in shared-nothingparallel databases fail to utilize non-uniform resources. Uniform resource usage across non-uniform components leads to resource bottlenecks. We describe a class of new executiontechniques that balance the usage of system resources using non-uniform intra-operatorparallelism. We show that these techniques improve performance on heterogeneous …,*,2000,3
Tutorial 3: Data Mining with Decision Trees,Johannes Gehrke,In this tutorial; we survey recent developments in learning tree-based models forclassification and regression called predictor trees. The tutorial has three parts:(1) A generaloverview of tree-based classification and regression.(2) A survey of methods to constructpredictor trees.(3) An overview of scalable data access methods to construct predictor treesfrom very large training databases. In the first part; we motivate predictor trees and their usein a data mining environment. We show results from real-life studies that illustrate howpredictor trees give understandable models where traditional models are hard or counter-intuitive to interpret; and compare related methods for classification and regression.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING,2000,3

Blotter: Low Latency Transactions for Geo-Replicated Storage,Henrique Moniz; João Leitão; Ricardo J Dias; Johannes Gehrke; Nuno Preguiça; Rodrigo Rodrigues,Abstract Most geo-replicated storage systems use weak consistency to avoid theperformance penalty of coordinating replicas in different data centers. This departure fromstrong semantics poses problems to application programmers; who need to address theanomalies enabled by weak consistency. In this paper we use a recently proposed isolationlevel; called Non-Monotonic Snapshot Isolation; to achieve ACID transactions with lowlatency. To this end; we present Blotter; a geo-replicated system that leverages thesesemantics in the design of a new concurrency control protocol that leaves a small amount oflocal state during reads to make commits more efficient; which is combined with aconfiguration of Paxos that is tailored for good performance in wide area settings.

Data Stream Management: A Brave New World,Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Traditional data-management systems software is built on the concept of persistentdata sets that are stored reliably in stable storage and queried/updated several timesthroughout their lifetime. For several emerging application domains; however; data arrivesand needs to be processed on a continuous basis; without the benefit of several passes overa static; persistent data image. Such continuous data streams arise naturally; for instancetelecom and IP network monitoring. This volume focuses on the theory and practice of datastream management; and the difficult; novel challenges this emerging domain introduces fordata-management systems. The collection of chapters (contributed by authorities in the field)offers a comprehensive introduction to both the algorithmic/theoretical foundations of datastreams and the streaming systems/applications built in different domains.

Technical perspective Data stream processing: when you only get one look,Johannes Gehrke,The database and systems communities have made great progress in developing databasesystems that allow us to store and query huge amounts of data. My first computer cost about$1;000; it was a Commodore 64 with a 170KB floppy disk drive. Today (September 2009); Ican configure a 1.7 TB file server for the same price. Companies are responding to thisexplosion in storage availability by building bigger and bigger data warehouses; whereevery digital trail we leave is stored for later analysis. Data arrives 24/7; and real-time" on-the-fly" analysis—where answers are always available—is becoming mandatory. Here iswhere data stream processing comes to the rescue.In data stream processing scenarios;data arrives at high speeds and must be analyzed in the order it is received using a limitedamount of memory.

Scalable decision tree construction,Johannes Gehrke,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,2

An indexing framework for structured p2p systems,Adina Crainiceanu; Prakash Linga; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Johannes Gehrke; Carl Lagoze; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram,Abstract Different collaborative applications in a peer-topeer (P2P) environment imposedifferent requirements on the underlying P2P system. In this paper; we present amodularized indexing framework that cleanly separates the functional components of astructured P2P index; thereby allowing an application to tailor an index to its needs; whilereusing components developed in previous systems. Our main contribution is a systematicway of handling query correctness; concurrency; and failures in the context of our indexingframework. Our techniques provide provable correctness and availability guarantees in adynamic P2P system. In a simulation study; we use our indexing framework to compare theperformance of three different P2P indices proposed in the literature. 1,*,2004,2

Multimodal Indexable Encryption for Mobile Cloud-based Applications,Bernardo Ferreira; João Leitão; Henrique Domingos,In this paper we propose MIE; a Multimodal Indexable Encryption framework that for the firsttime allows mobile applications to securely outsource the storage and search of theirmultimodal data (ie data containing multiple media formats) to public clouds with privacyguarantees. MIE is designed as a distributed framework architecture; leveraging on sharedcloud repositories that can be accessed simultaneously by multiple users. At its core MIErelies on Distance Preserving Encodings (DPE); a novel family of encoding algorithms withcryptographic properties that we also propose. By applying DPE to multimodal data features;MIE enables high-cost clustering and indexing operations to be handled by cloud servers ina privacy-preserving way.

In this paperwe show how to combine two emerging technologies---Software-Defined Flash (SDF) andprecise synchronized clocks---to improve performance and reduce complexity fortransactional storage within the data center. We present a distributed transactional system(called MILANA) as a layer above a durable multi-version key-value store (called SEMEL)for read-heavy workloads within a data center. SEMEL exploits write behavior of SSDs tomaintain a time-ordered sequence of versions for each key efficiently and durably.

Sketch-Based Multi-Query Processing over Data Streams,Alin Dobra; Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract We consider the problem of approximately answering multiple general aggregateSQL queries over continuous data streams with limited memory. Our method extends therandomizing techniques of Alon et al. that compute small “sketch” summaries of the streamsthat can then be used to provide approximate answers to aggregate queries with provableguarantees on the approximation error. By intelligently sharing the sketches among multiplequeries; the memory required can be reduced. We provide necessary and sufficientconditions for the sketch sharing to result in correct estimation and address optimizationproblems that arise. We also demonstrate how existing statistical information on the basedata (eg; histograms) can be used in the proposed framework to improve the quality of theapproximation provided by our algorithms. The key idea is to intelligently partition the …,*,2016,1

Pricing queries approximately optimally,Vasilis Syrgkanis; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract: Data as a commodity has always been purchased and sold. Recently; webservices that are data marketplaces have emerged that match data buyers with data sellers.So far there are no guidelines how to price queries against a database. We consider therecently proposed query-based pricing framework of Koutris et al and ask the question ofcomputing optimal input prices in this framework by formulating a buyer utility model. Weestablish the interesting and deep equivalence between arbitrage-freeness in the query-pricing framework and envy-freeness in pricing theory for appropriately chosen buyervaluations. Given the approximation hardness results from envy-free pricing we thendevelop logarithmic approximation pricing algorithms exploiting the max flow interpretationof the arbitrage-free pricing for the restricted query language proposed by Koutris et al …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05347,2015,1

Mostof the work trying to integrate the two fields is motivated by specific application scenarios. Inthis paper we approach this problem from another perspective. Instead of focusing on IR andDB as whole fields; we restrict the focus to search engines and column stores. We presentobservations of similarities in the two technologies; and aggregate information on paralleldevelopments in the two fields. We argue that these developments point towards aconfluence of column stores and search engines; and one may in fact argue that thisconfluence has already started. We evaluate the potential in developing an engine capableof handling the workloads traditionally supported by the different systems; namely decisionsupport and search workloads; by identifying potential opportunities and challenges.

Declarative; Domain-Specific Languages-Elegant Simplicity or a Hammer in Search of a Nail?,Samuel Madden; Johannes Gehrke,I. PANEL DESCRIPTION Recent years have seen a proliferation in proposals for database-inspired declarative languages for a number of nondatabase domains; including sensornetworks [1; 3; 6]; network protocol specification [2]; event monitoring [5]; program analysis[4]; computer games [7]; and the design of three-tier applications [8]. The typical argumentput forth in these proposals is that a declarative language is simple and hides many of theugly details that are inherent in whatever domain is being addressed. For example; insensor networks; a declarative language might allow users to specify what data they wantfrom a collection of sensors without worrying about low-level details like power managementor network organization. For network protocols; a set of declarative rules can be used tospecify how routing decisions should be made; allowing the protocol designer to avoid …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Typicalinformation sources range from news tickers; financial transaction logs and message logs tosatellite images and speech recordings. This wealth of data is continuously updated andarrives in high-speed data streams; it needs to be analyzed both in real-time (eg; to estimatethe importance of the information and to generate early threat alerts) and offline bysophisticated data mining tools. This work focuses on the real-time aspects of processingthese massive streams of intelligence data.

Directions in Multi-Query Optimization for Sensor Networks,Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Rajmohan Rajaraman; Niki Trigoni; Yong Yao,Abstract The widespread dissemination of small-scale sensor nodes has sparked interest ina powerful new database abstraction for sensor networks: Clients “program” the sensorsthrough queries in a high-level declarative language (such as a variant of SQL); and catalogmanagement and query processing techniques abstract the user from the physical details oftasking the sensors. We call the resulting system a sensor data management system(SDMS). Sensor networks have important constraints on communication; computation andpower consumption. Energy is the most valuable resource for unattended battery-powerednodes. Since radio communication consumes most of the available node power; our goal isto identify strategies that reduce network traffic.

Information responsive to the primary search is then used to browseone or more information sources for other information related to the result of the primarysearch. Navigational suggestions and navigational elements may be provided in a userinterface to allow the searching user to select the result of the primary search and/or tonavigate to other information items found for the primary search result from the one or moreinformation sources. Thus; a seamless transition between searching and browsing isenabled where searching and browsing may be accomplished in response to a singlesearching or browsing action.,*,2015,*
Balancing Isolation and Sharing of Data in Third-Party Extensible App Ecosystems,Florian Schröder; Raphael M Reischuk; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract In the landscape of application ecosystems; today's cloud users wish to personalizenot only their browsers with various extensions or their smartphones with variousapplications; but also the various extensions and applications themselves. The resultingpersonalization significantly raises the attractiveness for typical Web 2.0 users; but gives riseto various security risks and privacy concerns; such as unforeseen access to certain criticalcomponents; undesired information flow of personal information to untrusted applications; oremerging attack surfaces that were not possible before a personalization has taken place.We propose a novel extensibility mechanism to implement personalization of existing cloudapplications towards (possibly untrusted) components in a secure and privacy-friendlymanner.

Enhanced service environments with user-specific working sets,*,Systems; methods; and software are disclosed herein for implementing enhanced searchenvironments. In one implementation; an enhanced service environment includes a workingset service that receives event signals initiated by working set agents in various applicationservices. The working set agents communicate the event signals to nominate eventsoccurring in the application services for inclusion in a working set of information specific to auser. The nominations may be based at least in part on a working set model specific to theuser. In response to receiving the event signals; the working set service determines which ofthe events qualify for inclusion in the working set of information based at least in part on theworking set model. For each event that qualifies for inclusion; the working set is modified toinclude at least the event.,*,2015,*

Explainable Security for Relational Databases (Extended Experimental Evaluation),Gabriel Bender; Lucja Kot; Johannes Gehrke,This appendix contains an extended version of the experimental evaluation from Section 5of the paper Explainable Security for Relational Databases; which will appear in SIGMOD2014. In order to keep this document self-contained; we have duplicated material fromSection 5 of the paper in addition to including further experiments. The goal of ourexperimental evaluation was three-fold. First; we wanted to verify that SQL queriescontaining a wide range of commonly used features could be correctly handled by thecompiler discussed in Section 4. Second; we wanted to determine whether the language offilterproject queries described in Section 4.2 was powerful enough to represent a variety ofpractical security constraints.

A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Missing Value Imputation Algorithms,Vinod Nair; Rahul Kidambi; Sundararajan Sellamanickam; S Sathiya Keerthi; Johannes Gehrke; Vijay Narayanan,Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitatively evaluating missing value imputationalgorithms. Given a dataset with missing values and a choice of several imputationalgorithms to fill them in; there is currently no principled way to rank the algorithms using aquantitative metric. We develop a framework based on treating imputation evaluation as aproblem of comparing two distributions and show how it can be used to compute quantitativemetrics. We present an efficient procedure for applying this framework to practical datasets;demonstrate several metrics derived from the existing literature on comparing distributions;and propose a new metric called Neighborhood-based Dissimilarity Score which is fast tocompute and provides similar results. Results are shown on several datasets; metrics; andimputations algorithms.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.2276,2013,*

Declarative data-driven coordination,Johannes Gehrke,Abstract There are many applications that require users to coordinate and communicate.Friends want to coordinate travel plans; students want to jointly enroll in the same set ofcourses; and busy professionals want to coordinate their schedules. These tasks are difficultto program using existing abstractions provided by database systems because in addition tothe traditional ACID properties provided by the system they all require some type ofcoordination between users. This is fundamentally incompatible with isolation in theclassical ACID properties of transactions. In this talk; I argue that it is time for the databaseand event processing communities to look beyond isolation towards principled and elegantabstractions that allow for communication and coordination between some notion of(suitably generalized) transactions.

Playing games with databases,Johannes Gehrke,Scalability is a fundamental problem in the development of computer games and massivelymultiplayer online games (MMOs). Players always demand more-more polygons; morephysics particles; more interesting AI behavior; more monsters; more simultaneous playersand interactions; and larger virtual worlds. Scalability has long been a focus of the databaseresearch community. However; the games community has done little to exploit databaseresearch. Most game developers think of databases as persistence solutions; designed tostore and read game state. But the advantages of database systems go way beyondpersistence. Database research has dealt with the beautiful question of efficientlyprocessing declarative languages; and the resulting research questions have touched manyareas of computer science.

Scalable Winner Determination in Advertising Auctions,David Martin; Johannes Gehrke; Joseph Halpern,Internet search results are a growing and highly profitable advertising platform. Searchproviders auction advertising slots to advertisers on their search result pages. Due to thehigh volume of searches and the users' low tolerance for search result latency; it isimperative to resolve these auctions fast. Current approaches restrict the expressiveness ofbids in order to achieve fast winner determination; which is the problem of allocating slots toadvertisers so as to maximize the expected revenue given the advertisers' bids. The goal ofour work is to permit more expressive bidding; thus allowing advertisers to achieve complexadvertising goals; while still providing fast and scalable techniques for winner determination.We also discuss the application of our framework to advertising in massively multiplayeronline games.,*,2007,*

Flexible Decision Support in Device-Saturated Environments,Johannes Gehrke,Abstract: The widespread distribution of small-scale sensors; actuators; and embeddedprocessors is transforming the physical world into a computing platform. Sensor networkswith nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities with networking and computationcapabilities have become ubiquitous. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors arepreprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is processed. Thisapproach has two major drawbacks. First; the user cannot change the behavior of thesystem on the fly. Second; communication in today's networks is orders of magnitude moreexpensive than local computation; thus in-network processing can vastly reduce resourceusage. We investigated a database approach to unite the requirements of scalability andflexibility in monitoring the physical world. We built a new distributed data management …,*,2003,*

Privacy Preserving Mining of Association Rules,Johannes Gehrke,ABSTRACT We present a framework for mining association rules from transactionsconsisting of categorical items where the data has been randomized to preserve privacy ofindividual transactions. While it is feasible to recover association rules and preserve privacyusing a straightforward" uniform" randomization; the discovered rules can unfortunately beexploited to find privacy breaches. We analyze the nature of privacy breaches" and proposea class of randomization operators that are much more effective than uniform randomizationin limiting the breaches. We derive formulae for an unbiased support estimator and itsvariance; which allow us to recover itemset supports from randomized datasets; and showhow to incorporate these formulae into mining algorithms. Finally; we present experimentalresults that validate the algorithm by applying it on real datasets.,*,2002,*
Jaguar: Extending the Predator Database System with JAVA,Philippe Bonnet; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract: The Jaguar project is aimed at breaking down the traditional barriers that requireSQL query processing to reside on the database server. Indeed; database applications willsoon be accessed by large number of clients ranging from Web applications to small-scalepersonal devices and they will in turn access large collections of data sources ranging fromWeb servers to mobile sensor devices. In such applications; a large amount of computingresources lie outside the database server: they should be utilized for performance andsecurity reasons. The objective of the Jaguar project was to define portable query executionplans that could be executed either on the server; or on a client or on a remote data source(a web site; an active disk or a sensor device). Java was chosen as a platform for theexecution of these portable execution plans. New techniques supporting the execution of …,*,2001,*

The magazine archive includes every article published in Communications of the ACM for over the past 50 years.,Akhilesh Chandra; Thomas Calderon,Information systems (IS) are quickly emerging as critical resources to be leveraged fororganizational productivity in many business; social; and economic enterprises. Theexplosive growth in information technology (IT) can be broadly attributed to the emergingnovel linkages of IS/IT with several base disciplines; extending the reach of IS/IT toapplication domains never previously considered.In this article; we focus on certainimportant and promising IS/IT frontiers identified from the perspectives of academia; industry;and federal research funding agencies. Our objective is to focus the collective awareness ofthe IS community and those in related disciplines on some of the frontier developments inIS/IT with a vision of the road ahead and point to challenges and opportunities [1].,Communications of the ACM,2000,*

WWW PAGE,Johannes Gehrke; Philippe Bonnet,This project explores fundamental systems issues in query processing performance. Weinvestigate this problem from three different directions: client-server processing;heterogeneous environments; and database compression. First; we devised new queryprocessing strategies than push processing capabilities into the client; and we devisedquery execution plans that can span server and clients. This allows us to trade resourceusage between client; server and the interconnection network. We then extended this workto parallel query processing in heterogeneous environments; we are currently implementinga parallel dataflow engine that adapts naturally to resource imbalances at the hardwarecomponents. Last; we are investigating the use of compression in database systems. Wedevised a new framework for database compression and new query processing and …,*,1999,*
Scalable classification tree construction,Johannes Ernst Gehrke,Abstract Classification is an important data mining problem. We present algorithms forclassification tree construction that separate the scalability aspects from the central featuresthat determine the quality of the tree. Our work is easy to instantiate with specific splitselection methods from the literature (including C4. 5; CART; CHAID; FACT; ID3; GID3 andextensions; and QUEST). Our first contribution is a framework called RainForest for scalingup a broad class of split selection methods. In addition to its generality; in that it yieldsscalable versions of a wide range of split selection methods; RainForest also offersperformance improvements of over a factor of three over the SPRINT algorithm; the fastestscalable classification algorithm proposed previously.,*,1999,*

Data Management for Sensor Networks,Johannes Gehrke,One of the characteristics of the post-PC era is to push computation from desktops and datacenters out into the physical world. This is an exciting time for systems research; as systemsemerge with characteristics quite different from traditional environments. The area that wefind especially interesting is networked sensors. Already today networked sensored can beconstructed using commercial components using only a fraction of a watt in power on thescale of a few inches. Current prototypes measure already only 10cm3 [HSW+00]; andapplication of Moore's law tells us that we will soon see components that measure 1 cm3;and there is a plethora of research to scale down components to the 1 mm3 range (about thesize of a large piece of dust) integrated into the physical environment potentially powered byambient energy [KKP99]. Instead of deploying preprogrammed sensor networks only for …,*,*,*
Scalable Content in Virtual Worlds,Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Nitin Gupta; Benjamin Sowell; Walker White,Scalability is essential to creating rich and immersive virtual worlds. While one can definescalability as the ability to support a large number of concurrent users; we focus on scalingthe number of complex virtual objects that can interact in a virtual world. These include useravatars and models; but they also include additional items; characters; and behaviorscreated by both users and centralized service providers. This type of content is essential tocreate rich extensible worlds; and it may vastly outnumber individual users. We believe thatthere are three major requirements for the development of scalable content. Content must bedata-driven. The development of quality content requires different skills than thedevelopment of complex software systems. Data-driven development separates the scriptsfor object behavior from the underlying software of the world. This separation is crucial for …,*,*,*
A Proportional Share Resource Allocation Algorithm for Real-Time; Time-Shared Systems,Johannes E Gehrke; C Greg Plaxton,Abstract We propose and analyze a proportional share resource allocation algorithm forrealizing real-time performance in time-shared operating systems. In a proportional sharesystem; processes are assigned a weight which determines a share (percentage) of theresource they are to receive. The resource is then allocated in discrete-sized time quanta insuch a manner that each process makes progress at a precise; uniform rate. Proportionalshare allocation algorithms are of interest because (1) they provide a natural means ofseamlessly integrating real-and non-real-time processing requirements in a generalpurpose operating system;(2) they are easy to implement (and in particular; easier thanmore traditional forms of real-time support such as periodic tasks);(3) they provide a simpleand e ective means of precisely controlling the real-time performance of a process …,*,*,*
Three Case Studies of Large-Scale Data Flows,Johannes Gehrke; Lawrence Gibbons3 Christopher D Jones Valentin; Kuznetsov3 Dave Lifka4 Mirek Riedewald Dan; Riley3 Anders Ryd3 Gregory J Sharp,Abstract We survey three examples of large-scale scientific workflows that we are workingwith at Cornell: the Arecibo sky survey; the CLEO high-energy particle physics experiment;and the Web Lab project for enabling social science studies of the Internet. All three projectsface the same general challenges: massive amounts of raw data; expensive processingsteps; and the requirement to make raw data or data products available to users nation-orworld-wide. However; there are several differences that prevent a one-sizefits-all approachto handling their data flows. Instead; current implementations are heavily tuned by domainand data management experts. We describe the three projects; and we outline researchissues and opportunities to integrate Grid technology into these workflows.,*,*,*
Latency-Optimized Checkpoint Recovery Algorithms for Massively Multiplayer Online Games,Tuan Cao; Marcos Vaz Salles; Benjamin Sowell; Yao Yue; Alan Demers; Johannes Gehrke; Walker White,ABSTRACT Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs) are long-lived; interactive virtualworlds in which tens of thousands of people play together. In order to provide highlyimmersive experiences; MMO servers must support extremely high update rates–oftenhundreds of thousands of updates per second. A major concern for MMOs is to providedurability for the virtual world while limiting the overhead and perceived latency spikesintroduced in the game. Recent work has shown that existing checkpoint-recoveryalgorithms developed for main memory DBMSs can be applied to MMO workloads. In thispaper we propose two novel checkpointing algorithms that trade additional space in mainmemory for significantly lower latency. Compared to previous work; our new algorithms donot require any locking nor do they require bulk copies of the game state. Our …,*,*,*

SENSOR: Data-Driven Sensor Networks Final Report (September 2003 to August 2006): Activities and Findings,Johannes Gehrke; Rajmohan Rajaraman,In this project; we adopted a database approach to unite the seemingly conflictingrequirements of scalability and flexibility in monitoring the physical world. The objective ofthis research was to build a new distributed data management layer that scales with thegrowth of sensor interconnectivity and computational power on the sensors over the nextdecades. Our system is designed to create the abstraction of a single processing nodewithout centralizing data or computation. Since sensor networks are heavily resource-constrained; our research focused on cross-layer optimizations that are needed to exploitopportunities for the preservation of resources. Due to the regularity of query processingpatterns we designed query-layer specific routing algorithms that are optimized—not forgeneral point-to-point communication—but for the more regular types of communication …,*,*,*
