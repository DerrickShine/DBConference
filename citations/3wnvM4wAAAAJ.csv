Caffeic acid and its synthetic derivative CADPE suppress tumor angiogenesis by blocking STAT3-mediated VEGF expression in human renal carcinoma cells,Joo Eun Jung; Hong Sook Kim; Chang Seok Lee; Dae-Hun Park; Yong-Nyun Kim; Min-Jae Lee; Jung Weon Lee; Jong-Wan Park; Myung-Suk Kim; Sang Kyu Ye; Myung-Hee Chung,Abstract Tumor angiogenesis is required for tumor development and is stimulated byangiogenic inducers like VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Our previous studydemonstrated that STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) up-regulatesHIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor-1α) protein stability and enhances HIF-1-mediated VEGFexpression in hypoxic solid tumor cells; thus suggesting that the inhibition of STAT3signaling may have clinical applications. In this study; we examined in vitro and in vivo;whether caffeic acid (CA) or its derivative CADPE [3-(3; 4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-acrylic acid 2-(3; 4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-ethyl ester] exert anticancer activity by targeting STAT3. It was foundthat CA or CADPE significantly inhibit STAT3 activity; and that this in turn down-regulatesHIF-1α activity. Consequently; sequential blockade of STAT3 and HIF-1α resulted in the …,Carcinogenesis,2007,93
STAT3 inhibits the degradation of HIF-1α by pVHL-mediated ubiquitination,Joo Eun Jung; Hong Sook Kim; Chang Seok Lee; Yong-Jae Shin; Yong-Nyun Kim; Gyeong-Hoon Kang; Tae-You Kim; Yong-Sung Juhnn; Sung-Joon Kim; Jong-Wan Park; Sang-Kyu Ye; Myung-Hee Chung,Abstract Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under normoxic conditions. Ubiquitination of HIF-1α is mediated byinteraction with von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). In our previous report;we found that hypoxia-induced active signal transducer and activator of transcription3(STAT3) accelerated the accumulation of HIF-1α protein and prolonged its half-life in solidtumor cells. However; its specific mechanisms are not fully understood. Thus; we examinedthe role of STAT3 in the mechanism of pVHL-mediated HIF-1α stability. We found that STAT3interacts with C-terminal domain of HIF-1α and stabilizes HIF-1α by inhibition of pVHLbinding to HIF-1α. The binding between HIF-1α and pVHL; negative regulator of HIF-1αstability; was interfered dose-dependently by overexpressed constitutive active STAT3 …,Experimental & molecular medicine,2008,78
Room-temperature electronically-controlled ferromagnetism at the LaAlO 3/SrTiO 3 interface,Feng Bi; Mengchen Huang; Sangwoo Ryu; Hyungwoo Lee; Chung-Wung Bark; Chang-Beom Eom; Patrick Irvin; Jeremy Levy,Abstract Reports of emergent conductivity; superconductivity and magnetism have helped tofuel intense interest in the rich physics and technological potential of complex-oxideinterfaces. Here we employ magnetic force microscopy to search for room-temperaturemagnetism in the well-studied LaAlO 3/SrTiO 3 system. Using electrical top gating to controlthe electron density at the oxide interface; we directly observe the emergence of an in-planeferromagnetic phase as electrons are depleted from the interface. Itinerant electrons that arereintroduced into the interface align antiferromagnetically with the magnetization at firstscreening and then destabilizing it as the conductive regime is approached. Repeatedcycling of the gate voltage results in new; uncorrelated magnetic patterns. This newfoundcontrol over emergent magnetism at the interface between two non-magnetic oxides …,Nature communications,2014,74
Extending q-grams to estimate selectivity of string matching with low edit distance,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract There are many emerging database applications that require accurate selectivityestimation of approximate string matching queries. Edit distance is one of the mostcommonly used string similarity measures. In this paper; we study the problem of estimatingselectivity of string matching with low edit distance. Our framework is based on extending q-grams with wildcards. Based on the concepts of replacement semi-lattice; string hierarchyand a combinatorial analysis; we develop the formulas for selectivity estimation and providethe algorithm BasicEQ. We next develop the algorithm Opt EQ by enhancing BasicEQ withtwo novel improvements. Finally we show a comprehensive set of experiments using threebenchmarks comparing Opt EQ with the state-of-the-art method SEPIA. Our experimentalresults show that Opt EQ delivers more accurate selectivity estimations.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,63

Although high concentrations of S100A9 protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) arefound in patients with IBD; the expression mechanism of S100A9 in colonic epithelial cells(CECs) remains elusive. We investigated the role of IL-6 in S100A9 expression in CECsusing a colitis model. Methods IL-6 and S100A9 expression; signal transducer and activatorof transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation; and infiltration of immune cells were analyzed inmice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The effects of soluble gp130-Fcprotein (sgp130Fc) and S100A9 small interfering (si) RNA (si-S100A9) on DSS-inducedcolitis were evaluated.

STAT3-RANTES autocrine signaling is essential for tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancer cells,Eun Hee Yi; Chang Seok Lee; Jin-Ku Lee; Young Ju Lee; Min Kyung Shin; Chung-Hyun Cho; Keon Wook Kang; Jung Weon Lee; Wonshik Han; Dong-Young Noh; Yong-Nyun Kim; Ik-Hyun Cho; Sang-kyu Ye,The acquisition of tamoxifen resistance is a major therapeutic problem in breast cancer. Wedeveloped a tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (TRM-7) cell line to elucidate the molecularmechanisms and factors associated with acquisition of such resistance. We showed thatphosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 (Y705) and RANTES expression are increased inresponse to tamoxifen in human breast cancer cells. On the basis of these results; wehypothesize that upregulated STAT3 phosphorylation and RANTES may be correlated withthe development of drug resistance. Here; we showed that STAT3 and RANTES contributeto the maintenance of drug resistance. STAT3 phosphorylation is constitutively retained via aRANTES autocrine loop; which in turn upregulates anti-apoptotic signals in TRM-7 cells.STAT3–RANTES autocrine signaling affected expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family …,Molecular Cancer Research,2013,39

Moreover;overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 increased cyclin D1 transcriptional activity …,Anticancer research,2010,35
Similarity join size estimation using locality sensitive hashing,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Similarity joins are important operations with a broad range of applications. In thispaper; we study the problem of vector similarity join size estimation (VSJ). It is ageneralization of the previously studied set similarity join size estimation (SSJ) problem andcan handle more interesting cases such as TF-IDF vectors. One of the key challenges insimilarity join size estimation is that the join size can change dramatically depending on theinput similarity threshold. We propose a sampling based algorithm that uses Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH). The proposed algorithm LSH-SS uses an LSH index to enableeffective sampling even at high thresholds. We compare the proposed technique withrandom sampling and the state-of-the-art technique for SSJ (adapted to VSJ) anddemonstrate LSH-SS offers more accurate estimates throughout the similarity threshold …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,30
Power-law based estimation of set similarity join size,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We propose a novel technique for estimating the size of set similarity join. Theproposed technique relies on a succinct representation of sets using Min-Hash signatures.We exploit frequent patterns in the signatures for the Set Similarity Join (SSJoin) sizeestimation by counting their support. However; there are overlaps among the counts ofsignature patterns and we need to use the set Inclusion-Exclusion (IE) principle. We developa novel lattice-based counting method for efficiently evaluating the IE principle. Theproposed counting technique is linear in the lattice size. To make the mining process verylight-weight; we exploit a recently discovered Power-law relationship of pattern count andfrequency. Extensive experimental evaluations show the proposed technique is capable ofaccurate and efficient estimation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,29

Variance aware optimization of parameterized queries,Surajit Chaudhuri; Hongrae Lee; Vivek R Narasayya,Abstract Parameterized queries are commonly used in database applications. In aparameterized query; the same SQL statement is potentially executed multiple times withdifferent parameter values. In today's DBMSs the query optimizer typically chooses a singleexecution plan that is reused for multiple instances of the same query. A key problem is thateven if a plan with low average cost across instances is chosen; its variance can be high;which is undesirable in many production settings. In this paper; we describe techniques forselecting a plan that can better address the trade-off between the average and variance ofcost across instances of a parameterized query. We show how to efficiently compute theskyline in the average-variance cost space. We have implemented our techniques on top ofa commercial DBMS.

Performance evaluation and verification of communication protocol for railway signaling systems,Jae-Ho Lee; Jong-Gyu Hwang; Gwi-Tae Park,Abstract As long as railway signaling systems is digitalized; communication link is gettingmore important as a result of variety of communication links; such as links for interfacebetween each signaling are replaced by digital communication channels. However; thecommunication links for current railroad signaling have some problems in Korea. At first; themaintenance is difficult because protocols for interface are applied differently at the eachmanufacturer. Also; communication protocols; such as structure; byte format; and errorcorrection method; have a little non-logical part; which threatens safety. In order to solve thisproblem; the standard communication verified by using formal method is required. Afterdesigning new protocol for railway signaling; this paper analyzed the designed protocol'sstructure and performance through simulation.

Liver X receptor activation inhibits melanogenesis through the acceleration of ERK-mediated MITF degradation,Chang Seok Lee; Miyoung Park; Jiwon Han; Ji-hae Lee; Il-Hong Bae; Hyunjung Choi; Eui Dong Son; Young-Ho Park; Kyung-Min Lim,Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-activated transcriptionfactors regulating lipid metabolism and inflammation. In the skin; activation of LXRsstimulates differentiation of keratinocytes and augments lipid synthesis in sebocytes.However; the function of LXRs in melanocytes remains largely unknown. We investigatedwhether LXR activation would affect melanogenesis. In human primary melanocytes; MNT-1;and B16 melanoma cells; TO901317; a synthetic LXR ligand; inhibited melanogenesis.Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments revealed the dominant role of LXRβ inTO901317-mediated antimelanogenesis.

Approximate substring selectivity estimation,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We study the problem of estimating selectivity of approximate substring queries. Itsimportance in databases is ever increasing as more and more data are input by users andare integrated with many typographical errors and different spelling conventions. To beginwith; we consider edit distance for the similarity between a pair of strings. Based oninformation stored in an extended N-gram table; we propose two estimation algorithms; MOFand LBS for the task. The latter extends the former with ideas from set hashing signatures.The experimental results show that MOF is a light-weight algorithm that gives fairly accurateestimations. However; if more space is available; LBS can give better accuracy than MOFand other baseline methods. Next; we extend the proposed solution to other similaritypredicates; SQL LIKE operator and Jaccard similarity.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,16

An experimental study on injection molding of etched surface pattern,Chung Huang Jing,Abstract Molding properties of etched surface pattern are presented. Injection molding hasgiven attention on improving dimensional accuracy and productivity. However; the moldingof etched surface pattern on plastic parts is not researched relatively for its additional values;which can meet design function and customer's attraction. Specimens; whose surfacepatterns are made by print-type etching; are investigated. The molding properties of surfacepattern are estimated with roughness deviation of surface pattern on part and mold. Theetching properties are related to physical properties of plastic materials and surfaceroughness of etched pattern. Also; flow mark and gate location can give influence on surfacepattern molding. The experimental result can contribute to good molding of surface pattern ininjection molding.,Journal of the Korean Society for Precision Engineering,2003,1

Effect of amino acid residues on N-terminal extension of GLP-1/IgG-Fc fusion protein,C Lee; J Boyineni; HS Chung; SH Jang,Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone playing an important role in glucose-dependent insulin secretion and β-cell growth. However; GLP-1 is rapidly degraded bydipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) in vivo. Many attempts have been made to develop long-acting GLP-1 analogs with chemical modification; amino acid substitution; and fusion proteintechnology. We previously showed that the N-terminal Ala-or Gly-extended GLP-1 andhuman immunoglobulin gamma heavy chain (IgG-Fc) fusion protein is resistant to DPP-IV invitro and induces expression of insulin receptor substrate-2 in INS-1 cells (Bull. KoreanChem. Soc. 2009 30 2471–2474). In this study; we substituted a polar; aliphatic; charged; oraromatic amino acid (Ser; Leu; Lys; Asp; or Phe) for Ala or Gly; which was tethered on the N-terminus of GLP-1/IgG-Fc fusion protein; and compared the effects on the GLP-1 receptor …,*,2011,*

Swelling Behavior and Hydration Number of Langmuir-Blodgett Films of Metal-Palmitate Deposited on a Piezoelectric Quartz Crystal Plate,Chung Jong-Jae; Seo Byung-Il,Abstract Monolayers of calcium palmitate were deposited on a piezoelectric quartz crystalplate by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique; and it was found from frequency changes ofthe quartz crystal deposited LB films. The usual carbonyl absorbance at 1704 cm wasreplaced by the split band in the 1540~ 1590 cm. The two absorptions at 1580 cm and 1540cm were assigned to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the calcium carboxylate groupand the hydrated species due to the lowering carbonyl stretching frequency by hydrogenbonding respectively. Besides; it was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction analysis. Theswelling behaviour of LB films in water phase at 23 was observed from the frequencychange of the LB films deposited quartz crystal with time.

Combinatorial analysis is a ratherfragmentary subject: it has few general techniques and few unifying principles. From time totime; mathematicians (for example; MacMahon) have sought to bring some sort of order andstructure to the subject by writing textbooks. This is what Mr. Riordan; one of the world's leadingcombinatorialists; now sets out to do with combinatorial identities; and the present book is a companionto his earlier text An Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis (1958).

Ginsenoside F1 exerts the whitening effects through the reduced dendrite formation of melanocytes in human experimental systems,Chang-Seok Lee; Gi-Baeg Nam; Il-Hong Bae; Jun-Seong Park,Ginsenosides are the major active ingredients of ginseng; a constituent of variousbiomedical treatments; such as immunomodulation and anti-inflammation drugs. In skinphysiology; ginsenosides affect pigment regulation and exhibit anti-aging activity. Accordingto recent reports; ginsenoside Rg1 increases melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity inhuman melanocytes [1]. In contrast; ginsenoside F1 (GF1); a metabolite produced byhydrolysis of Rg1; is reported to inhibit visible pigmentation. A clinical study by Han et al.[2]demonstrated a skin whitening effect of GF1 on artificially tanned human skin caused byinterleukin 13 (IL-13) production from human epidermal γδ T cells. Kim and co-workersshowed that GF1 reduces melanin secretion through dendrite retraction with no effects onthe intracellular melanin content and tyrosinase expression in α-MSH-stimulated B16F10 …,*,*,*
