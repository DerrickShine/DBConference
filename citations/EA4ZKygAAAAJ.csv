Low rank matrix recovery for real-time cardiac MRI,Bo Zhao; Justin P Haldar; Cornelius Brinegar; Zhi-Pei Liang,Real-time cardiac MRI is a very challenging problem because of limitations on imagingspeed and resolution. To address this problem; the (k; t)-space MR signal is modeled asbeing partially separable along the spatial and temporal dimensions; which results in a rank-deficient data matrix. Image reconstruction is then formulated as a low-rank matrix recoveryproblem; which is solved using emerging low-rank matrix recovery techniques. In this paper;the Power Factorization algorithm is applied to efficiently recover the cardiac data matrix.Promising results are presented to demonstrate the performance of this novel approach.,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,2010,103

PSF model-based reconstruction with sparsity constraint: Algorithm and application to real-time cardiac MRI,Bo Zhao; Justin P Haldar; Zhi-Pei Liang,The partially separable function (PSF) model has been successfully used to reconstructcardiac MR images with high spatiotemporal resolution from sparsely sampled (k; t)-spacedata.

Regularized image reconstruction for PS model-based cardiovascular MRI,Anthony G Christodoulou; Bo Zhao; Zhi-Pei Liang,Real-time cardiovascular MRI is a useful and challenging dynamic imaging application. Thepartial separability (PS) model enables reconstruction of dynamic cardiac images fromhighly undersampled (k; t)-space data. However; the underlying PS model-basedreconstruction problem is ill-conditioned; so regularization is often necessary to stabilize itssolution. It has been shown that ℓ 1 regularization is useful for finding sparse solutions; andℓ 2 regularization is widely used to incorporate anatomical constraints.
