The global k-means clustering algorithm,Aristidis Likas; Nikos Vlassis; Jakob J Verbeek,Abstract We present the global k-means algorithm which is an incremental approach toclustering that dynamically adds one cluster center at a time through a deterministic globalsearch procedure consisting of N (with N being the size of the data set) executions of the k-means algorithm from suitable initial positions. We also propose modifications of the methodto reduce the computational load without significantly affecting solution quality. Theproposed clustering methods are tested on well-known data sets and they comparefavorably to the k-means algorithm with random restarts.,Pattern recognition,2003,1277
Image classification with the Fisher vector: Theory and practice,Jorge Sánchez; Florent Perronnin; Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract A standard approach to describe an image for classification and retrieval purposesis to extract a set of local patch descriptors; encode them into a high dimensional vector andpool them into an image-level signature. The most common patch encoding strategyconsists in quantizing the local descriptors into a finite set of prototypical elements. Thisleads to the popular Bag-of-Visual words representation. In this work; we propose to use theFisher Kernel framework as an alternative patch encoding strategy: we describe patches bytheir deviation from an “universal” generative Gaussian mixture model. This representation;which we call Fisher vector has many advantages: it is efficient to compute; it leads toexcellent results even with efficient linear classifiers; and it can be compressed with aminimal loss of accuracy using product quantization. We report experimental results on …,International journal of computer vision,2013,871
Is that you? Metric learning approaches for face identification,Matthieu Guillaumin; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Face identification is the problem of determining whether two face images depict the sameperson or not. This is difficult due to variations in scale; pose; lighting; background;expression; hairstyle; and glasses. In this paper we present two methods for learning robustdistance measures:(a) a logistic discriminant approach which learns the metric from a set oflabelled image pairs (LDML) and (b) a nearest neighbour approach which computes theprobability for two images to belong to the same class (MkNN). We evaluate our approacheson the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set; a large and very challenging data set of facesfrom Yahoo! News. The evaluation protocol for this data set defines a restricted setting;where a fixed set of positive and negative image pairs is given; as well as an unrestrictedone; where faces are labelled by their identity. We are the first to present results for the …,ICCV,2009,661
Tagprop: Discriminative metric learning in nearest neighbor models for image auto-annotation,Matthieu Guillaumin; Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Image auto-annotation is an important open problem in computer vision. For this task wepropose TagProp; a discriminatively trained nearest neighbor model. Tags of test imagesare predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images.Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration ofmetric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the trainingset. In this manner; we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics thatcover different aspects of image content; such as local shape descriptors; or global colorhistograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weightedneighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance ofdifferent variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental …,ICCV 2009,2009,566
Learning color names for real-world applications,Joost Van De Weijer; Cordelia Schmid; Jakob Verbeek; Diane Larlus,Color names are required in real-world applications such as image retrieval and imageannotation. Traditionally; they are learned from a collection of labeled color chips. Thesecolor chips are labeled with color names within a well-defined experimental setup by humantest subjects. However; naming colors in real-world images differs significantly from thisexperimental setting. In this paper; we investigate how color names learned from color chipscompare to color names learned from real-world images. To avoid hand labeling real-worldimages with color names; we use Google image to collect a data set. Due to the limitations ofGoogle image; this data set contains a substantial quantity of wrongly labeled data. Wepropose several variants of the PLSA model to learn color names from this noisy data.Experimental results show that color names learned from real-world images significantly …,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2009,391
Efficient greedy learning of Gaussian mixture models,JJ Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; B Kröse,This article concerns the greedy learning of gaussian mixtures. In the greedy approach;mixture components are inserted into the mixture one aftertheother. We propose a heuristicfor searching for the optimal component to insert. In a randomized manner; a set ofcandidate new components is generated. For each of these candidates; we find the locallyoptimal new component and insert it into the existing mixture. The resulting algorithmresolves the sensitivity to initialization of state-of-the-art methods; like expectationmaximization; and has running time linear in the number of data points and quadratic in the(final) number of mixture components. Due to its greedy nature; the algorithm can beparticularly useful when the optimal number of mixture components is unknown.Experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm to other methods on density …,Neural computation,2003,380
Multimodal semi-supervised learning for image classification,Matthieu Guillaumin; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,In image categorization the goal is to decide if an image belongs to a certain category or not.A binary classifier can be learned from manually labeled images; while using more labeledexamples improves performance; obtaining the image labels is a time consuming process.We are interested in how other sources of information can aid the learning process given afixed amount of labeled images. In particular; we consider a scenario where keywords areassociated with the training images; eg as found on photo sharing websites. The goal is tolearn a classifier for images alone; but we will use the keywords associated with labeled andunlabeled images to improve the classifier using semi-supervised learning. We first learn astrong Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) classifier using both the image content and keywords;and use it to score unlabeled images. We then learn classifiers on visual features only …,CVPR,2010,334
Action and event recognition with fisher vectors on a compact feature set,Dan Oneata; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract Action recognition in uncontrolled video is an important and challenging computervision problem. Recent progress in this area is due to new local features and models thatcapture spatio-temporal structure between local features; or human-object interactions.Instead of working towards more complex models; we focus on the low-level features andtheir encoding. We evaluate the use of Fisher vectors as an alternative to bag-of-wordhistograms to aggregate a small set of state-of-the-art low-level descriptors; in combinationwith linear classifiers. We present a large and varied set of evaluations; considering (i)classification of short actions in five datasets;(ii) localization of such actions in feature-lengthmovies; and (iii) large-scale recognition of complex events. We find that for basic actionrecognition and localization MBH features alone are enough for stateof-the-art …,Computer Vision (ICCV); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,291
Region classification with markov field aspect models,Jakob Verbeek; Bill Triggs,Considerable advances have been made in learning to recognize and localize visual objectclasses. Simple bag-of-feature approaches label each pixel or patch independently. Moreadvanced models attempt to improve the coherence of the labellings by introducing someform of inter-patch coupling: traditional spatial models such as MRF's provide crisper locallabellings by exploiting neighbourhood-level couplings; while aspect models such as PLSAand LDA use global relevance estimates (global mixing proportions for the classesappearing in the image) to shape the local choices. We point out that the two approachesare complementary; combining them to produce aspect-based spatial field models thatoutperform both approaches. We study two spatial models: one based on averaging overforests of minimal spanning trees linking neighboring image regions; the other on an …,CVPR 2007,2007,241
Accurate image search using the contextual dissimilarity measure,Herve Jegou; Cordelia Schmid; Hedi Harzallah; Jakob Verbeek,This paper introduces the contextual dissimilarity measure; which significantly improves theaccuracy of bag-of-features-based image search. Our measure takes into account the localdistribution of the vectors and iteratively estimates distance update terms in the spirit ofSinkhorn's scaling algorithm; thereby modifying the neighborhood structure. Experimentalresults show that our approach gives significantly better results than a standard distance andoutperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy on the Nisteacuter-Steweacutenius andLola data sets. This paper also evaluates the impact of a large number of parameters;including the number of descriptors; the clustering method; the visual vocabulary size; andthe distance measure. The optimal parameter choice is shown to be quite context-dependent. In particular; using a large number of descriptors is interesting only when …,Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence; IEEE Transactions on,2010,175
Modeling spatial layout with Fisher vectors for image categorization,Josip Krapac; Jakob Verbeek; Frédéric Jurie,We introduce an extension of bag-of-words image representations to encode spatial layout.Using the Fisher kernel framework we derive a representation that encodes the spatial meanand the variance of image regions associated with visual words. We extend thisrepresentation by using a Gaussian mixture model to encode spatial layout; and show thatthis model is related to a soft-assign version of the spatial pyramid representation. We alsocombine our representation of spatial layout with the use of Fisher kernels to encode theappearance of local features. Through an extensive experimental evaluation; we show thatour representation yields state-of-the-art image categorization results; while being morecompact than spatial pyramid representations. In particular; using Fisher kernels to encodeboth appearance and spatial layout results in an image representation that is …,ICCV,2011,172

Learning color names from real-world images,Joost Van De Weijer; Cordelia Schmid; Jakob Verbeek,Within a computer vision context color naming is the action of assigning linguistic colorlabels to image pixels. In general; research on color naming applies the following paradigm:a collection of color chips is labelled with color names within a well-defined experimentalsetup by multiple test subjects. The collected data set is subsequently used to label RGBvalues in real-world images with a color name. Apart from the fact that this collection processis time consuming; it is unclear to what extent color naming within a controlled setup isrepresentative for color naming in real-world images. Therefore we propose to learn colornames from real-world images. Furthermore; we avoid test subjects by using Google Imageto collect a data set. Due to limitations of Google Image this data set contains a substantialquantity of wrongly labelled data. The color names are learned using a PLSA model …,CVPR,2007,152
Metric learning for large scale image classification: Generalizing to new classes at near-zero cost,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Florent Perronnin; Gabriela Csurka,Abstract We are interested in large-scale image classification and especially in the settingwhere images corresponding to new or existing classes are continuously added to thetraining set. Our goal is to devise classifiers which can incorporate such images and classeson-the-fly at (near) zero cost. We cast this problem into one of learning a metric which isshared across all classes and explore k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean(NCM) classifiers. We learn metrics on the ImageNet 2010 challenge data set; whichcontains more than 1.2 M training images of 1K classes. Surprisingly; the NCM classifiercompares favorably to the more flexible k-NN classifier; and has comparable performance tolinear SVMs. We also study the generalization performance; among others by using thelearned metric on the ImageNet-10K dataset; and we obtain competitive performance …,*,2012,134
A k-segments algorithm for finding principal curves,JJ Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,Abstract We propose an incremental method to find principal curves. Line segments arefitted and connected to form polygonal lines (PLs). New segments are inserted until aperformance criterion is met. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the methodcompared to other existing approaches.,Pattern Recognition Letters,2002,126
A robust and efficient video representation for action recognition,Heng Wang; Dan Oneata; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract This paper introduces a state-of-the-art video representation and applies it toefficient action recognition and detection. We first propose to improve the popular densetrajectory features by explicit camera motion estimation. More specifically; we extract featurepoint matches between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow. The matchesare used to estimate a homography with RANSAC. To improve the robustness ofhomography estimation; a human detector is employed to remove outlier matches from thehuman body as human motion is not constrained by the camera. Trajectories consistent withthe homography are considered as due to camera motion; and thus removed. We also usethe homography to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This results in significantimprovement on motion-based HOF and MBH descriptors. We further explore the recent …,International Journal of Computer Vision,2016,124
Distance-Based Image Classification: Generalizing to New Classes at Near Zero Cost,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Florent Perronnin; Gabriela Csurka,We study large-scale image classification methods that can incorporate new classes andtraining images continuously over time at negligible cost. To this end; we consider twodistance-based classifiers; the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM)classifiers; and introduce a new metric learning approach for the latter. We also introduce anextension of the NCM classifier to allow for richer class representations. Experiments on theImageNet 2010 challenge dataset; which contains over 10 6 training images of 1;000classes; show that; surprisingly; the NCM classifier compares favorably to the more flexible k-NN classifier. Moreover; the NCM performance is comparable to that of linear SVMs whichobtain current state-of-the-art performance. Experimentally; we study the generalizationperformance to classes that were not used to learn the metrics. Using a metric learned on …,PAMI,2013,123
Improving web image search results using query-relative classifiers,Josip Krapac; Moray Allan; Jakob Verbeek; Frederic Juried,Web image search using text queries has received considerable attention. However; currentstate-of-the-art approaches require training models for every new query; and are thereforeunsuitable for real-world web search applications. The key contribution of this paper is tointroduce generic classifiers that are based on query-relative features which can be used fornew queries without additional training. They combine textual features; based on theoccurence of query terms in web pages and image meta-data; and visual histogramrepresentations of images. The second contribution of the paper is a new database for theevaluation of web image search algorithms. It includes 71478 images returned by a websearch engine for 353 different search queries; along with their meta-data and ground-truthannotations. Using this data set; we compared the image ranking performance of our …,CVPR,2010,121

Unsupervised Metric Learning for Face Identification in TV Video,Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,The goal of face identification is to decide whether two faces depict the same person or not.This paper addresses the identification problem for face-tracks that are automaticallycollected from uncontrolled TV video data. Face-track identification is an importantcomponent in systems that automatically label characters in TV series or movies based onsubtitles and/or scripts: it enables effective transfer of the sparse text-based supervision toother faces. We show that; without manually labeling any examples; metric learning can beeffectively used to address this problem. This is possible by using pairs of faces within atrack as positive examples; while negative training examples can be generated from pairs offace tracks of different people that appear together in a video frame. In this manner we canlearn a cast-specific metric; adapted to the people appearing in a particular video; without …,ICCV,2011,118
Spatio-temporal object detection proposals,Dan Oneata; Jérôme Revaud; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract Spatio-temporal detection of actions and events in video is a challenging problem.Besides the difficulties related to recognition; a major challenge for detection in video is thesize of the search space defined by spatio-temporal tubes formed by sequences of boundingboxes along the frames. Recently methods that generate unsupervised detection proposalshave proven to be very effective for object detection in still images. These methods open thepossibility to use strong but computationally expensive features since only a relatively smallnumber of detection hypotheses need to be assessed. In this paper we make twocontributions towards exploiting detection proposals for spatio-temporal detection problems.First; we extend a recent 2D object proposal method; to produce spatio-temporal proposalsby a randomized supervoxel merging process. We introduce spatial; temporal; and spatio …,European conference on computer vision,2014,116
Segmentation driven object detection with fisher vectors,Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,We present an object detection system based on the Fisher vector (FV) imagerepresentation computed over SIFT and color descriptors. For computational and storageefficiency; we use a recent segmentation-based method to generate class-independentobject detection hypotheses; in combination with data compression techniques. Our maincontribution is a method to produce tentative object segmentation masks to suppressbackground clutter in the features. Re-weighting the local image features based on thesemasks is shown to improve object detection significantly. We also exploit contextual featuresin the form of a full-image FV descriptor; and an inter-category rescoring mechanism. Ourexperiments on the VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets show that our detector improves over thecurrent state-of-the-art detection results.,Computer Vision (ICCV); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,115
Multiple instance metric learning from automatically labeled bags of faces,Matthieu Guillaumin; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract Metric learning aims at finding a distance that approximates a task-specific notion ofsemantic similarity. Typically; a Mahalanobis distance is learned from pairs of data labeledas being semantically similar or not. In this paper; we learn such metrics in a weaklysupervised setting where “bags” of instances are labeled with “bags” of labels. We formulatethe problem as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem over pairs of bags. If two bagsshare at least one label; we label the pair positive; and negative otherwise. We propose tolearn a metric using those labeled pairs of bags; leading to MildML; for multiple instancelogistic discriminant metric learning. MildML iterates between updates of the metric andselection of putative positive pairs of examples from positive pairs of bags. To evaluate ourapproach; we introduce a large and challenging data set; Labeled Yahoo! News; which …,ECCV,2010,112
Using high-level visual information for color constancy,Joost Van De Weijer; Cordelia Schmid; Jakob Verbeek,We propose to use high-level visual information to improve illuminant estimation. Severalilluminant estimation approaches are applied to compute a set of possible illuminants. Foreach of them an illuminant color corrected image is evaluated on the likelihood of itssemantic content: is the grass green; the road grey; and the sky blue; in correspondencewith our prior knowledge of the world. The illuminant resulting in the most likely semanticcomposition of the image is selected as the illuminant color. To evaluate the likelihood of thesemantic content; we apply probabilistic latent semantic analysis. The image is modelled asa mixture of semantic classes; such as sky; grass; road; and building. The class descriptionis based on texture; position and color information. Experiments show that the use of high-level information improves illuminant estimation over a purely bottom-up approach …,CVPR,2007,110
Automatic face naming with caption-based supervision,Matthieu Guillaumin; Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,We consider two scenarios of naming people in databases of news photos with captions:(i)finding faces of a single person; and (ii) assigning names to all faces. We combine an initialtext-based step; that restricts the name assigned to a face to the set of names appearing inthe caption; with a second step that analyzes visual features of faces. By searching forgroups of highly similar faces that can be associated with a name; the results of purely text-based search can be greatly ameliorated. We improve a recent graph-based approach; inwhich nodes correspond to faces and edges connect highly similar faces. We introduceconstraints when optimizing the objective function; and propose improvements in the low-level methods used to construct the graphs. Furthermore; we generalize the graph-basedapproach to face naming in the full data set. In this multi-person naming case the …,CVPR,2008,97
Image annotation with tagprop on the mirflickr set,Jakob Verbeek; Matthieu Guillaumin; Thomas Mensink; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract Image annotation is an important computer vision problem where the goal is todetermine the relevance of annotation terms for images. Image annotation has two mainapplications:(i) proposing a list of relevant terms to users that want to assign indexing termsto images; and (ii) supporting keyword based search for images without indexing terms;using the relevance estimates to rank images. In this paper we present TagProp; a weightednearest neighbour model that predicts the term relevance of images by taking a weightedsum of the annotations of the visually most similar images in an annotated training set.TagProp can use a collection of distance measures capturing different aspects of imagecontent; such as local shape descriptors; and global colour histograms. It automatically findsthe optimal combination of distances to define the visual neighbours of images that are …,Proceedings of the international conference on Multimedia information retrieval,2010,92
Weakly supervised object localization with multi-fold multiple instance learning,Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Object category localization is a challenging problem in computer vision. Standardsupervised training requires bounding box annotations of object instances. This time-consuming annotation process is sidestepped in weakly supervised learning. In this case;the supervised information is restricted to binary labels that indicate the absence/presenceof object instances in the image; without their locations. We follow a multiple-instancelearning approach that iteratively trains the detector and infers the object locations in thepositive training images. Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learningprocedure; which prevents training from prematurely locking onto erroneous objectlocations. This procedure is particularly important when using high-dimensionalrepresentations; such as Fisher vectors and convolutional neural network features.

Learning nonlinear image manifolds by global alignment of local linear models,Jakob Verbeek,Appearance-based methods; based on statistical models of the pixel values in an image(region) rather than geometrical object models; are increasingly popular in computer vision.In many applications; the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) in the image generatingprocess is much lower than the number of pixels in the image. If there is a smooth functionthat maps the DOF to the pixel values; then the images are confined to a low-dimensionalmanifold embedded in the image space. We propose a method based on probabilisticmixtures of factor analyzers to 1) model the density of images sampled from such manifoldsand 2) recover global parameterizations of the manifold. A globally nonlinear probabilistictwo-way mapping between coordinates on the manifold and images is obtained bycombining several; locally valid; linear mappings. We propose a parameter estimation …,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,2006,87
Face recognition from caption-based supervision,Matthieu Guillaumin; Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract In this paper; we present methods for face recognition using a collection of imageswith captions. We consider two tasks: retrieving all faces of a particular person in a data set;and establishing the correct association between the names in the captions and the faces inthe images. This is challenging because of the very large appearance variation in theimages; as well as the potential mismatch between images and their captions. For bothtasks; we compare generative and discriminative probabilistic models; as well as methodsthat maximize subgraph densities in similarity graphs. We extend them by consideringdifferent metric learning techniques to obtain appropriate face representations that reduceintra person variability and increase inter person separation. For the retrieval task; we alsostudy the benefit of query expansion. To evaluate performance; we use a new fully …,International Journal of Computer Vision,2012,75
Self-organizing mixture models,Jakob J Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben JA Kröse,Abstract We present an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that yields topologypreserving maps of data based on probabilistic mixture models. Our approach is applicableto any mixture model for which we have a normal EM algorithm. Compared to other mixturemodel approaches to self-organizing maps (SOMs); the function our algorithm maximizeshas a clear interpretation: it sums data log-likelihood and a penalty term that enforces self-organization. Our approach allows principled handling of missing data and learning ofmixtures of SOMs. We present example applications illustrating our approach for continuous;discrete; and mixed discrete and continuous data.,Neurocomputing,2005,74
Semi-supervised dimensionality reduction using pairwise equivalence constraints,Hakan Cevikalp; Jakob Verbeek; Frederic Jurie; Alexander Klaser,To deal with the problem of insufficient labeled data; usually side information--given in theform of pairwise equivalence constraints between points--is used to discover groups withindata. However; existing methods using side information typically fail in cases with high-dimensional spaces. In this paper; we address the problem of learning from side informationfor high-dimensional data. To this end; we propose a semi-supervised dimensionalityreduction scheme that incorporates pairwise equivalence constraints for finding a betterembedding space; which improves the performance of subsequent clustering andclassification phases. Our method builds on the assumption that points in a sufficiently smallneighborhood tend to have the same label. Equivalence constraints are employed to modifythe neighborhoods and to increase the separability of different classes.

Non-linear CCA and PCA by alignment of local models,Jakob J Verbeek; Sam T Roweis; Nikos Vlassis,Abstract We propose a non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method whichworks by coordinating or aligning mixtures of linear models. In the same way that CCAextends the idea of PCA; our work extends recent methods for non-linear dimensionalityreduction to the case where multiple embeddings of the same underlying low dimensionalcoordinates are observed; each lying on a different high dimensional manifold. We alsoshow that a special case of our method; when applied to only a single manifold; reduces tothe Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm. As with previous alignment schemes; once the mixturemodels have been estimated; all of the parameters of our model can be estimated in closedform without local optima in the learning. Experimental results illustrate the viability of theapproach as a non-linear extension of CCA.,NIPS,2004,67
Active appearance-based robot localization using stereo vision,JM Porta; JJ Verbeek; BJA Kröse,Abstract A vision-based robot localization system must be robust: able to keep track of theposition of the robot at any time even if illumination conditions change and; in the extremecase of a failure; able to efficiently recover the correct position of the robot. With thisobjective in mind; we enhance the existing appearance-based robot localization frameworkin two directions by exploiting the use of a stereo camera mounted on a pan-and-tilt device.First; we move from the classical passive appearance-based localization framework to anactive one where the robot sometimes executes actions with the only purpose of gaininginformation about its location in the environment. Along this line; we introduce an entropy-based criterion for action selection that can be efficiently evaluated in our probabilisticlocalization system. The execution of the actions selected using this criterion allows the …,Autonomous Robots,2005,66

In this paper we propose an adversarial training approach totrain semantic segmentation models. We train a convolutional semantic segmentationnetwork along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps comingeither from the ground truth or from the segmentation network. The motivation for ourapproach is that it can detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between ground truthsegmentation maps and the ones produced by the segmentation net.

Image categorization using Fisher kernels of non-iid image models,Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,The bag-of-words (BoW) model treats images as an unordered set of local regions andrepresents them by visual word histograms. Implicitly; regions are assumed to be identicallyand independently distributed (iid); which is a poor assumption from a modeling perspective.We introduce non-iid models by treating the parameters of BoW models as latent variableswhich are integrated out; rendering all local regions dependent. Using the Fisher kernel weencode an image by the gradient of the data log-likelihood wrt hyper-parameters that controlpriors on the model parameters. Our representation naturally involves discountingtransformations similar to taking square-roots; providing an explanation of why suchtransformations have proven successful.

Accelerated EM-based clustering of large data sets,Jakob J Verbeek; Jan RJ Nunnink; Nikos Vlassis,Abstract Motivated by the poor performance (linear complexity) of the EM algorithm inclustering large data sets; and inspired by the successful accelerated versions of relatedalgorithms like k-means; we derive an accelerated variant of the EM algorithm for Gaussianmixtures that:(1) offers speedups that are at least linear in the number of data points;(2)ensures convergence by strictly increasing a lower bound on the data log-likelihood in eachlearning step; and (3) allows ample freedom in the design of other accelerated variants. Wealso derive a similar accelerated algorithm for greedy mixture learning; where verysatisfactory results are obtained. The core idea is to define a lower bound on the data log-likelihood based on a grouping of data points. The bound is maximized by computing in turn(i) optimal assignments of groups of data points to the mixture components; and (ii) …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2006,58
Category level object segmentation by combining bag-of-words models with dirichlet processes and random fields,Diane Larlus; Jakob Verbeek; Frédéric Jurie,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of accurately segmenting instances of objectclasses in images without any human interaction. Our model combines a bag-of-wordsrecognition component with spatial regularization based on a random field and a Dirichletprocess mixture. Bag-of-words models successfully predict the presence of an object withinan image; however; they can not accurately locate object boundaries. Random Fields takeinto account the spatial layout of images and provide local spatial regularization. Yet; as theyuse local coupling between image labels; they fail to capture larger scale structures neededfor object recognition. These components are combined with a Dirichlet process mixture. Itmodels images as a composition of regions; each representing a single object instance.Gibbs sampling is used for parameter estimations and object segmentation.

Coordinating principal component analyzers,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Kröse,Abstract Mixtures of Principal Component Analyzers can be used to model high dimensionaldata that lie on or near a low dimensional manifold. By linearly mapping the PCA subspacesto one global low dimensional space; we obtain a 'global'low dimensional coordinate systemfor the data. As shown by Roweis et al.; ensuring consistent global low-dimensionalcoordinates for the data can be expressed as a penalized likelihood optimization problem.We show that a restricted form of the Mixtures of Probabilistic PCA model allows for a moreefficient algorithm. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the viability method.,International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks,2002,52
The LEAR submission at Thumos 2014,Dan Oneata; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,We describe the submission of the INRIA LEAR team to the THU-MOS workshop inconjunction with ECCV 2014. Our system is based on Fisher vector (FV) encoding of densetrajectory features (DTF); which we also used in our 2013 submission. This year'ssubmission additionally incorporates static-image features (SIFT; Color; and CNN) andaudio features (ASR and MFCC) for the classification task. For the detection task; wecombine scores from the clas-sification task with FV-DTF features extracted from videoslices. We found that these additional visual and audio feature significantly improve theclassification results. For localization we found that using the classification scores as acontex-tual feature besides local motion features leads to significant improvements.,*,2014,47
Efficient action localization with approximately normalized Fisher vectors,Dan Oneata; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract The Fisher vector (FV) representation is a highdimensional extension of the popularbag-of-word representation. Transformation of the FV by power and ℓ2 normalizations hasshown to significantly improve its performance; and led to state-of-the-art results for a rangeof image and video classification and retrieval tasks. These normalizations; however; renderthe representation non-additive over local descriptors. Combined with its highdimensionality; this makes the FV computationally expensive for the purpose of localizationtasks. In this paper we present approximations to both these normalizations; which yieldsignificant improvements in the memory and computational costs of the FV when used forlocalization. Second; we show how these approximations can be used to define upper-bounds on the score function that can be efficiently evaluated; which enables the use of …,Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition,2014,46

Learning structured prediction models for interactive image labeling,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Gabriela Csurka,We propose structured models for image labeling that take into account the dependenciesamong the image labels explicitly. These models are more expressive than independentlabel predictors; and lead to more accurate predictions. While the improvement is modest forfully-automatic image labeling; the gain is significant in an interactive scenario where a userprovides the value of some of the image labels. Such an interactive scenario offers aninteresting trade-off between accuracy and manual labeling effort. The structured models areused to decide which labels should be set by the user; and transfer the user input to moreaccurate predictions on other image labels. We also apply our models to attribute-basedimage classification; where attribute predictions of a test image are mapped to classprobabilities by means of a given attribute-class mapping.

Mixture models for clustering and dimension reduction,Jakob Verbeek,In Chapter 1 we give a general introduction and motivate the need for clustering anddimension reduction methods. We continue in Chapther 2 with a review of different types ofexisting clustering and dimension reduction methods. In Chapter 3 we introduce mixturedensities and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate their parameters.Although the EM algorithm has many attractive properties; it is not guaranteed to returnoptimal parameter estimates. We present greedy EM parameter estimation algorithms whichstart with a one-component mixture and then iteratively add a component to the mixture andre-estimate the parameters of the current mixture. Experimentally; we demonstrate that ouralgorithms avoid many of the sub-optimal estimates returned by the EM algorithm. Finally;we present an approach to accelerate mixture densities estimation from many data points …,*,2004,35
Gaussian fields for semi-supervised regression and correspondence learning,Jakob J Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis,Abstract Gaussian fields (GF) have recently received considerable attention for dimensionreduction and semi-supervised classification. In this paper we show how the GF frameworkcan be used for semi-supervised regression on high-dimensional data. We propose anactive learning strategy based on entropy minimization and a maximum likelihood modelselection method. Furthermore; we show how a recent generalization of the LLE algorithmfor correspondence learning can be cast into the GF framework; which obviates the need tochoose a representation dimensionality.,Pattern Recognition,2006,34

A soft k-segments algorithm for principal curves,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Kröse,Abstract We propose a new method to find principal curves for data sets. The methodrepeats three steps until a stopping criterion is met. In the first step; k (unconnected) linesegments are fitted on the data. The second step connects the segments to form a polygonalline; and evaluates the quality of the resulting polygonal line. The third step inserts a newline segment. We compare the performance of our new method with other existing methodsto find principal curves.,ICANN,2001,33
Tree-structured CRF models for interactive image labeling,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Gabriela Csurka,We propose structured prediction models for image labeling that explicitly take into accountdependencies among image labels. In our tree-structured models; image labels are nodes;and edges encode dependency relations. To allow for more complex dependencies; wecombine labels in a single node and use mixtures of trees. Our models are more expressivethan independent predictors; and lead to more accurate label predictions. The gainbecomes more significant in an interactive scenario where a user provides the value ofsome of the image labels at test time. Such an interactive scenario offers an interestingtradeoff between label accuracy and manual labeling effort. The structured models are usedto decide which labels should be set by the user; and transfer the user input to moreaccurate predictions on other image labels.

Convolutional Neural Fabrics,Shreyas Saxena; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract Despite the success of CNNs; selecting the optimal architecture for a given taskremains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture; wepropose a``fabric''that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabricconsists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers; scales; and channelswith a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabricare the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered aspaths; the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together; sharing theirweights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methodsbased on back-propagation; at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size.

LEAR and XRCE's participation to visual concept detection task-ImageCLEF 2010,Thomas Mensink; Gabriela Csurka; Florent Perronnin; Jorge Sánchez; Jakob Verbeek,In this paper we present the common effort of Lear and XRCE for the ImageCLEF VisualConcept Detection and Annotation Task. We first sought to combine our individual state-of-the-art approaches: the Fisher vector image representation; with the TagProp method forimage auto-annotation. Our second motivation was to investigate the annotationperformance by using extra information in the form of provided Flickr-tags. The results showthat using the Flickr-tags in combination with visual features improves the results of anymethod using only visual features. Our winning system; an early-fusion linear-SVM classifier;trained on visual and Flickr-tags features; obtains 45.5% in mean Average Precision (mAP);almost a 5% absolute improvement compared to the best visual-only system.

A variational EM algorithm for large-scale mixture modeling,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Jan Nunnink,Mixture densities constitute a rich family of models that can be used in several data miningand machine learning applications; for instance; clustering. Although practical algorithmsexist for learning such models from data; these algorithms typically do not scale very wellwith large datasets. Our approach; which builds on previous work by other authors; offers anacceleration of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures by precomputing and storingsufficient statistics of the data in the nodes of a kd-tree. Contrary to other works; we obtainalgorithms that strictly increase a lower bound on the data log-likelihood in every learningstep. Experimental results illustrate the validity of our approach.,Annual Conference of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging,2003,24
Transformation invariant component analysis for binary images,Zoran Zivkovic; Jakob Verbeek,There are various situations where image data is binary: character recognition; result ofimage segmentation etc. As a first contribution; we compare Gaussian based principalcomponent analysis (PCA); which is often used to model images; and" binary PCA" whichmodels the binary data more naturally using Bernoulli distributions. Furthermore; weaddress the problem of data alignment. Image data is often perturbed by some globaltransformations such as shifting; rotation; scaling etc. In such cases the data needs to betransformed to some canonical aligned form. As a second contribution; we extend the binaryPCA to the" transformation invariant mixture of binary PCAs" which simultaneously correctsthe data for a set of global transformations and learns the binary PCA model on the aligneddata.,CVPR,2006,21
Learning Tree-structured Descriptor Quantizers for Image Categorization,Josip Krapac; Jakob Verbeek; Frederic Jurie,Current state-of-the-art image categorization systems rely on bag-of-words representationsthat model image content as a histogram of quantization indices that code local imageappearance. In this context; randomized tree-structured quantizers have been shown to beboth computationally efficient and yielding discriminative visual words for a givencategorization task. This paper presents a new algorithm that builds tree-structuredquantizers not to optimize patch classification but to directly optimize the image classificationperformance. This approach is experimentally validated on several challenging data sets forwhich it outperforms other patch quantizers such as standard decision trees or k-means.,British Machine Vision Conference,2011,20
Heterogeneous face recognition with CNNs,Shreyas Saxena; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract Heterogeneous face recognition aims to recognize faces across different sensormodalities. Typically; gallery images are normal visible spectrum images; and probe imagesare infrared images or sketches. Recently significant improvements in visible spectrum facerecognition have been obtained by CNNs learned from very large training datasets. In thispaper; we are interested in the question to what extent the features from a CNN pre-trainedon visible spectrum face images can be used to perform heterogeneous face recognition.We explore different metric learning strategies to reduce the discrepancies between thedifferent modalities. Experimental results show that we can use CNNs trained on visiblespectrum images to obtain results that are on par or improve over the state-of-the-art forheterogeneous recognition with near-infrared images and sketches.,European Conference on Computer Vision,2016,18

Region-Based Image Classification with a Latent SVM Model,Oksana Yakhnenko; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Image classification is a challenging problem due to intra-class appearance variation;background clutter; occlusion; and photometric variability. Current state-of-the-art methodsdo not explicitly handle background clutter; but rely on global image representations; suchas bag-of-word (BoW) models. Multiple-instance learning has been used to explicitly dealwith clutter; classifying an image positively as soon as at least one image region is classifiedpositively. In this paper; we propose a more robust latent-SVM model that; unlike multiple-instance learning; does not rely on a single image region to trigger a positive imageclassification. Rather; our model scores an images using all regions; and associates witheach region a latent variable that indicates whether the region represents the object ofinterest or its background. Background and foreground regions are each scored by a …,*,2011,16
Fast nonlinear dimensionality reduction with topology preserving networks,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,We present a fast alternative for the Isomap algorithm. A set of quantizers is fit to the dataand a neighborhood structure based on the competitive Hebbian rule is imposed on it. Thisstructure is used to obtain low-dimensional description of the data by means of computinggeodesic distances and multi dimensional scaling. The quantization allows for fasterprocessing of the data. The speed-up as compared to Isomap is roughly quadratic in theratio between the number of quan-tizers and the number of data points. The quantizers andneighborhood structure are use to map the data to the low dimensional space.,Eurorean Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks,2002,15
Accelerated greedy mixture learning,Jan Nunnink; Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis,Mixture probability densities are popular models that are used in several data mining andmachine learning applications; eg; clustering. A standard algorithm for learning such modelsfrom data is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However; EM can be slow withlarge datasets; and therefore approximation techniques are needed. In this paper wepropose a variational approximation to the greedy EM algorithm which oers speedups thatare at least linear in the number of data points. Moreover; by strictly increasing a lowerbound on the data log-likelihood in every learning step; our algorithm guaranteesconvergence. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on a synthetic experiment wheresatisfactory results are obtained.,Annual Machine Learning Conference of Belgium and the Netherlands,2004,14
Approximate fisher kernels of non-iid image models for image categorization,Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,The bag-of-words (BoW) model treats images as sets of local descriptors and representsthem by visual word histograms. The Fisher vector (FV) representation extends BoW; byconsidering the first and second order statistics of local descriptors. In both representationslocal descriptors are assumed to be identically and independently distributed (iid); which is apoor assumption from a modeling perspective. It has been experimentally observed that theperformance of BoW and FV representations can be improved by employing discountingtransformations such as power normalization. In this paper; we introduce non-iid models bytreating the model parameters as latent variables which are integrated out; rendering alllocal regions dependent. Using the Fisher kernel principle we encode an image by thegradient of the data log-likelihood wrt the model hyper-parameters.

It is also of utmost importance in real-time systems; eg in robotics orautonomous driving; which depend on visual scene understanding for decision making.While prediction of the raw RGB pixel values in future video frames has been studied inprevious work; here we focus on predicting semantic segmentations of future frames. Moreprecisely; given a sequence of semantically segmented video frames; our goal is to predictsegmentation maps of not yet observed video frames that lie up to a second or further in thefuture.

Frankenstein: Learning deep face representations using small data,Guosheng Hu; Xiaojiang Peng; Yongxin Yang; Timothy Hospedales; Jakob Verbeek,Deep convolutional neural networks have recently proven extremely effective for difficultface recognition problems in uncontrolled settings. To train such networks; very largetraining sets are needed with millions of labeled images. For some applications; such asnear-infrared (NIR) face recognition; such large training data sets are not publicly availableand difficult to collect. In this paper; we propose a method to generate very large trainingdata sets of synthetic images by compositing real face images in a given data set. We showthat this method enables to learn models from as few as 10 000 training images; whichperform on par with models trained from 500 000 images. Using our approach; we alsoobtain state-of-the-art results on the CASIA NIR-VIS2. 0 heterogeneous face recognitiondata set.,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017,12
Ranking user-annotated images for multiple query terms,Moray Allan; Jakob Verbeek,We show how web image search can be improved by taking into account the users whoprovided different images; and that performance when searching for multiple terms can beincreased by learning a new combined model and taking account of images which partiallymatch the query. Search queries are answered by using a mixture of kernel densityestimators to rank the visual content of web images from the Flickr website whose noisy tagannotations match the given query terms. Experiments show that requiring agreementbetween images from different users allows a better model of the visual class to be learnt;and that precision can be increased by rejecting images from'untrustworthy'users. We focuson search queries for multiple terms; and demonstrate enhanced performance by learning asingle model for the overall query; treating images which only satisfy a subset of the …,British Machine Vision Conference,2009,12

Eachinput point has an associated covariance matrix that can be interpreted as the uncertainty bywhich this point was observed.

Circulant temporal encoding for video retrieval and temporal alignment,Matthijs Douze; Jérôme Revaud; Jakob Verbeek; Hervé Jégou; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract We address the problem of specific video event retrieval. Given a query video of aspecific event; eg; a concert of Madonna; the goal is to retrieve other videos of the sameevent that temporally overlap with the query. Our approach encodes the frame descriptors ofa video to jointly represent their appearance and temporal order. It exploits the properties ofcirculant matrices to efficiently compare the videos in the frequency domain. This offers asignificant gain in complexity and accurately localizes the matching parts of videos. Thedescriptors can be compressed in the frequency domain with a product quantizer adapted tocomplex numbers. In this case; video retrieval is performed without decompressing thedescriptors. We also consider the temporal alignment of a set of videos.

Ep for efficient stochastic control with obstacles,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Bert Kappen,We address the problem of continuous stochastic optimal control in the presence of hardobstacles. Due to the non-smooth character of the obstacles; the traditional approach usingdynamic programming in combination with function approximation tends to fail. We considera recently introduced special class of control problems for which the optimal controlcomputation is reformulated in terms of a path integral. The path integral is typicallyintractable; but amenable to techniques developed for approximate inference. We argue thatthe variational approach fails in this case due to the nonsmooth cost function. Samplingtechniques are simple to implement and converge to the exact results given enoughsamples. However; the infinite cost associated with hard obstacles renders the samplingprocedures inefficient in practice.

Coordinated local metric learning,Shreyas Saxena; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract Mahalanobis metric learning amounts to learning a linear data projection; afterwhich the ℓ2 metric is used to compute distances. To allow more flexible metrics; notrestricted to linear projections; local metric learning techniques have been developed. Mostof these methods partition the data space using clustering; and for each cluster a separatemetric is learned. Using local metrics; however; it is not clear how to measure distancesbetween data points assigned to different clusters. In this paper we propose to embed thelocal metrics in a global low-dimensional representation; in which the ℓ2 metric can be used.With each cluster we associate a linear mapping that projects the data to the globalrepresentation. This global representation directly allows computing distances betweenpoints regardless to which local cluster they belong. Moreover; it also enables data …,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops,2015,8

We present a method to select which words to cluster in word groups and howmany such word groups to use on the basis of a set of pre-classified texts. The methodinvolves agreedy'search through the space of possible word groups. The words are groupedaccording to theJensen-Shannon divergence'between the corresponding distributions overthe classes. The criterion to decide which number of word groups to use is based onRissanen's MDL Principle. We present empirical results that indicate that the proposedmethod performs well. Furthermore; the proposed method outperforms cross-validation inthe sense that far fewer word groups are selected while prediction accuracy is just slightlyworse.

Procrustes analysis to coordinate mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers can be used to model data that lieson or near a low dimensional manifold in a high dimensional observation space; in effecttiling the manifold with local linear (Gaussian) patches. In order to exploit the lowdimensional structure of the data manifold; the patches need to be localized and oriented ina low dimensional space; so that local coordinates on the patches can be mapped to globallow dimensional coordinates. As shown by [Roweis et al.; 2002]; this problem can beexpressed as a penalized likelihood optimization problem. We show that a restricted form ofthe Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers model allows for an efficient EM-style algorithm.

Compressed fisher vectors for large-scale image classification,Jorge Sanchez; Florent Perronnin; Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract: A standard approach to describe an image for image classification and imageretrieval; is to extract a set of local patch descriptors; encode them into a high dimensionalvector and pool them into an image-level signature. The most common patch encodingstrategy consists in quantizing the local descriptors into a finite set of prototypical elements.This leads to the popular Bag-of-Visual words (BoV) representation. In this work; we proposeto use the Fisher Kernel framework as an alternative patch encoding strategy: we describepatches by their deviation from an “universal” generative model. This representation; whichwe call Fisher Vector (FV) has many advantages: it is efficient to compute; it leads toexcellent results even with costless linear classifiers; and it can be compressed with aminimal loss of accuracy using product quantization.

Category level object segmentation by combining bag-of-words models and Markov Random Fields,Diane Larlus; Jakob Verbeek; Frédérick Jurie,This paper presents an approach to segment unseen objects of known categories. At theheart of the approach lies a probabilistic model of images which captures local appearanceof objects through a bag-of-words representation. Bag-of-words models have been verysuccessful for image categorization; however; as they model objects as loose collections ofsmall image patches; they can not accurately predict object boundaries. On the other hand;Markov Random Fields (MRFs); which are often used in many low-level application forgeneral purpose image segmentation; do incorporate the spatial layout of images. Yet; asthey are usually based on very local image evidence they fail to capture larger scalestructures needed to recognize object categories under large appearance variations.

Enhancing appearance-based robot localization using sparse disparity maps,Josep M Porta; Jakob J Verbeek; Ben Kröse,In this paper; we enhance appearance-based robot localization by using disparity maps.Disparity maps provide the same type of information as range based sensors (distance toobjects) and thus; they are likely to be less sensitive to changes of illumination than plainimages; that are the source of information generally used in appearance-based localization.The main drawback of disparity maps is that they can include very noisy depth values: pointsfor which the algorithms can not determine reliable depth information. These noisy valueshave to be discarded resulting in missing values. The presence of missing values makesprincipal component analysis (the standard method used to compress images in theappearance-based framework) unfeasible. We describe a novel expectation-maximizationalgorithm to determine the principal components of a data set including missing values …,In Proceedings of the International Conference on Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IROS); Las Vegas,2003,6
Efficient greedy learning of Gaussian mixtures,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,We present a deterministic greedy method to learn a mixture of Gaussians which runs in O(nk^ 2) time. The key element is that we build the mixture component-wise. By allocating anew component close to optimal in the existing (close to optimal) learned mixture; we hopeto be able to reach a solution close to optimal for the new mixture. Each component of themixture is characterized by a fixed number of parameters. Then; instead of solving directly aoptimization problem involving the parameters of all components; we replace the problem bya sequence of optimization problems involving only the parameters of the new component.We include experimental results obtained on image segmentation and reconstruction tasksas well as results of extensive tests on artificially generated data sets. In these experimentsthe learning method compares favorably to the standard EM with random initializations as …,*,2001,6

Areas of Attention for Image Captioning,Marco Pedersoli; Thomas Lucas; Cordelia Schmid; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract We propose “Areas of Attention”; a novel attentionbased model for automatic imagecaptioning. Our approach models the dependencies between image regions; caption words;and the state of an RNN language model; using three pairwise interactions. In contrast toprevious attentionbased approaches that associate image regions only to the RNN state; ourmethod allows a direct association between caption words and image regions. Duringtraining these associations are inferred from image-level captions; akin to weakly-supervised object detector training. These associations help to improve captioning bylocalizing the corresponding regions during testing. We also propose and compare differentways of generating attention areas: CNN activation grids; object proposals; and spatialtransformers nets applied in a convolutional fashion.

Large scale metric learning for distance-based image classification,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Florent Perronnin; Gabriela Csurka,This paper studies large-scale image classification; in a setting where new classes andtraining images could continuously be added at (near) zero cost. We cast this problem intoone of learning a low-rank metric; which is shared across all classes and explore k-nearestneighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM) classifiers. We also introduce an extensionof the NCM classifier to allow for richer image representations. Experiments on the ImageNet2010 challenge dataset---which contains more than 1M training images of 1K classes---shows; surprisingly; that the NCM classifier compares favorably to the more flexible k-NNclassifier. Moreover; the NCM performance suggests that 256 dimensional features iscomparable to that of linear SVMs; which were used to obtain the current state-of-the-artperformance.

Spatial Fisher Vectors for Image Categorization,Josip Krapac; Jakob Verbeek; Frédéric Jurie,We introduce an extension of bag-of-words image representations to encode spatial layout.Using the Fisher kernel framework we derive a representation that encodes the spatial meanand the variance of image regions associated with visual words. We extend thisrepresentation by using a Gaussian mixture model to encode spatial layout; and show thatthis model is related to a soft-assign version of the spatial pyramid representation.

Weighted Transmedia Relevance Feedback for Image Retrieval and Auto-annotation,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Gabriela Csurka,Currently large scale multimodal image databases have become widely available; forexample via photo sharing sites where images come along with textual descriptions andkeyword annotations. Most existing work on image retrieval and image auto-annotation hasconsidered uni-modal techniques; either focusing on query-by-example systems or query-by-text systems for image retrieval; and mono modal classification for image auto-annotation.However recent state-of-the-art multimodal image retrieval and image auto-annotationsystems combine different uni-modal models using late-fusion techniques. In addition;significant advances have been made by using pseudo-relevance feedback techniques; aswell as using transmedia relevance models that swap modalities in the query expansionstep of pseudo-relevance methods. While these techniques are promising it is not trivial to …,*,2011,4
Self-organization by optimizing free-energy,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,Abstract:[en] We present a variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to learnprobabilistic mixture models. The algorithm is similar to Kohonen's Self-Organizing Mapalgorithm and not limited to Gaussian mixtures. We maximize the variational free-energy thatsums data log-likelihood and Kullback-Leibler divergence between a normalizedneighborhood function and the posterior distribution on the components; given data. Weillustrate the algorithm with an application on word clustering.,European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks,2003,4
Locally linear generative topographic mapping,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,We propose a method for non-linear data pro-jection that combines Generative TopographicMapping and Coordinated PCA. We extend the Generative Topographic Mapping by usingmore complex nodes in the network: each node provides a linear map between the dataspace and the latent space. The location of a node in the data space is given by a smoothnon-linear function of its location in the latent space. Our model provides a piece-wise linearmapping between data and latent space; as opposed to the point-wise coupling of theGenerative Topographic Mapping. We provide experimental results comparing this modelwith GTM.,Benelearn: Annual Machine Learning Conference of Belgium and the Netherlands,2002,4
Predicting deeper into the future of semantic segmentation,Pauline Luc; Natalia Neverova; Camille Couprie; Jakob Verbeek; Yann LeCun,Abstract The ability to predict and therefore to anticipate the future is an important attribute ofintelligence. It is also of utmost importance in real-time systems; eg. in robotics orautonomous driving; which depend on visual scene understanding for decision making.While prediction of the raw RGB pixel values in future video frames has been studied inprevious work; here we introduce the novel task of predicting semantic segmentations offuture frames. Given a sequence of video frames; our goal is to predict segmentation mapsof not yet observed video frames that lie up to a second or further in the future. We developan autoregressive convolutional neural network that learns to iteratively generate multipleframes. Our results on the Cityscapes dataset show that directly predicting futuresegmentations is substantially better than predicting and then segmenting future RGB …,of: ICCV 2017-International Conference on Computer Vision,2017,3
Retrieval systems and methods employing probabilistic cross-media relevance feedback,*,In a retrieval application; a document relevance scoring function comprises a weightedcombination of scoring components including at least one of a pseudo-relevance scoringcomponent and a cross-media relevance scoring component. Weights of the documentrelevance scoring function are optimized to generate a trained document relevance scoringfunction. The optimizing is respective to a set of training documents including at least somemultimedia training documents and a set of training queries and corresponding trainingdocument relevance annotations. A retrieval operation is performed for an input queryrespective to a database using the trained document relevance scoring function to retrieveone or more documents from the database.,*,2013,3
Color Names,Robert Benavente; Maria Vanrell; Cordelia Schmid; Ramon Baldrich; Jakob Verbeek; Diane Larlus,Abstract Within a computer vision context color naming is the action of assigning linguisticcolor labels to pixels; regions or objects in images. Humans use color names routinely andseemingly without effort to describe the world around us. They have been primarily studiedin the fields of visual psychology; anthropology and linguistics [17]. Color names are forexample used in the context of image retrieval. A user might query an image search enginefor" red cars". The system recognizes the color name" red"; and orders the retrieved resultson" car" based on their resemblance to the human usage of" red'. Furthermore; knowledge ofvisual attributes can be used to assist object recognition methods. For example; for an imageannotated with the text" Orange stapler on table"; knowledge of the color name orangewould greatly simplify the task of discovering where (or what) the stapler is. Color names …,*,2012,3
Learning to Rank and Quadratic Assignment,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Tiberio Caetano,In this paper we show that the optimization of several ranking-based performance measures;such as precision-at-k and average-precision; is intimately related to the solution ofquadratic assignment problems. Both the task of test-time prediction of the best ranking andthe task of constraint generation in estimators based on structured support vector machinescan all be seen as special cases of quadratic assignment problems. Although suchproblems are in general NP-hard; we identify a polynomially-solvable subclass (for bothinference and learning) that still enables the modeling of a substantial number of pairwiserank interactions. We show preliminary results on a public benchmark image annotationdata set; which indicates that this model can deliver higher performance over rankingmodels without pairwise rank dependencies.,NIPS Workshop on Discrete Optimization in Machine Learning,2011,3
Patch-level spatial layout for classification and weakly supervised localization,Valentina Zadrija; Josip Krapac; Jakob Verbeek; Siniša Šegvić,Abstract We propose a discriminative patch-level model which combines appearance andspatial layout cues. We start from a block-sparse model of patch appearance based on thenormalized Fisher vector representation. The appearance model is responsible for (i)selecting a discriminative subset of visual words; and (ii) identifying distinctive patchesassigned to the selected subset. These patches are further filtered by a sparse spatial modeloperating on a novel representation of pairwise patch layout. We have evaluated theproposed pipeline in image classification and weakly supervised localization experimentson a public traffic sign dataset. The results show significant advantage of the combinedmodel over state of the art appearance models.,German Conference on Pattern Recognition,2015,2
Large scale metric learning for distance-based image classification on open ended data sets,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Florent Perronnin; Gabriela Csurka,Abstract Many real-life large-scale datasets are open-ended and dynamic: new images arecontinuously added to existing classes; new classes appear over time; and the semantics ofexisting classes might evolve too. Therefore; we study large-scale image classificationmethods that can incorporate new classes and training images continuously over time atnegligible cost. To this end; we consider two distance-based classifiers; the k-nearestneighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM) classifiers. Since the performance ofdistance-based classifiers heavily depends on the used distance function; we cast theproblem into one of learning a low-rank metric; which is shared across all classes. For theNCM classifier; we introduce a new metric learning approach; and we also introduce anextension to allow for richer class representations. Experiments on the ImageNet 2010 …,*,2013,2

Semi-supervised learning with Gaussian fields,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis,Gaussian fields (GF) have recently received considerable attention for dimension reductionand semi-supervised classification. This paper presents two contributions. First; we showhow the GF framework can be used for regression tasks on high-dimensional data. Weconsider an active learning strategy based on entropy minimization and a maximumlikelihood model selection method. Second; we show how a recent generalization of theLocally Linear Embedding algorithm for correspondence learning can also be cast into theGF framework; which obviates the need to choose a representation dimensionality.,*,2005,2
Dynamic filters in graph convolutional networks,Nitika Verma; Edmond Boyer; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have massively impacted visual recognitionin 2D images; and are now ubiquitous in state-of-the-art approaches. While CNNs naturallyextend to other domains; such as audio and video; where data is also organized inrectangular grids; they do not easily generalize to other types of data such as 3D shapemeshes; social network graphs or molecular graphs. To handle such data; we propose anovel graph-convolutional network architecture that builds on a generic formulation thatrelaxes the 1-to-1 correspondence between filter weights and data elements around thecenter of the convolution. The main novelty of our architecture is that the shape of the filter isa function of the features in the previous network layer; which is learned as an integral partof the neural network.

Weakly Supervised Object Localization with Multi-fold Multiple Instance Learning,Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis; Jakob Verbeek; Cordelia Schmid,Abstract Object category localization is a challenging problem in computer vision. Standardsupervised training requires bounding box annotations of object instances. This time-consuming annotation process is sidestepped in weakly supervised learning. In this case;the supervised information is restricted to binary labels that indicate the absence/presenceof object instances in the image; without their locations. We follow a multiple-instancelearning approach that iteratively trains the detector and infers the object locations in thepositive training images. Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learningprocedure; which prevents training from prematurely locking onto erroneous objectlocations. This procedure is particularly important when using high-dimensionalrepresentations; such as Fisher vectors and convolutional neural network features. We …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.00949,2015,1
Rodent behavior annotation from video,Jakob Verbeek,In this report we describe the models with which we experimented to predict rodent behaviorfrom video recordings. Automatic recognition of rodent behavior from video is a desirabletool in behavioral studies since it can significantly reduce the required human effort andsimultaneously reduce the dependence of results on particular human observers. In ourresearch we considered several variants of Hidden Markov Models and compared resultsagainst a simple logistic discriminant classifier that ignores the correlation of behaviorsbetween successive frames. For a selection of four behaviors a correct classification ratearound 75% is obtained.,*,2005,1
Non-linear feature extraction by the coordination of mixture models,Jakob Verbeek; Nikos Vlassis; Ben Krose,We present a method for non-linear data projection that offers non-linear versions ofPrincipal Component Analysis and Canonical Correlation Analysis. The data is accessedthrough a probabilistic mixture model only; therefore any mixture model for any type of datacan be plugged in. Gaussian mixtures are one example; but mixtures of Bernoulli's to modeldiscrete data might be used as well. The algorithm minimizes an objective function thatexhibits one global optimum that can be found by finding the eigenvectors of some matrix.Experimental results on toy data and real data are provided.,Annual Conference of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging,2003,1
Overfitting using the MDL principle,Jakob Verbeek,This thesis investigates the experimental results obtained in the paper" An experimental andtheoretical comparison of model selection methods" by Kearn; Mansour; Ng; and Ron;published in volume 27 of Machine Learning 1997 (referred to as [KMNR97]). These'modelselection methods' are used to find a'good'model for some observed data. The data consistsof pairs (x; y). Often the'x-data'is regarded as given and the model is a function that mapseach x-value to a y-value.

Auxiliary Guided Autoregressive Variational Autoencoders,Thomas Lucas; Jakob Verbeek,Abstract: Generative modeling of high-dimensional data is a key problem in machinelearning. Successful approaches include latent variable models and autoregressive models.The complementary strengths of these approaches; to model global and local imagestatistics respectively; suggest hybrid models combining the strengths of both models. Ourcontribution is to train such hybrid models using an auxiliary loss function that controls whichinformation is captured by the latent variables and what is left to the autoregressive decoder.In contrast; prior work on such hybrid models needed to limit the capacity of theautoregressive decoder to prevent degenerate models that ignore the latent variables andonly rely on autoregressive modeling.

Each multidimensional class representation is computed asa function of a set of multidimensional representations of labeled samples; each labeled withthe respective class.

Trans Media Relevance Feedback for Image Autoannotation,Thomas Mensink; Jakob Verbeek; Gabriela Csurka,Automatic image annotation is an important tool for keyword-based image retrieval;providing a textual index for non-annotated images. Many image auto annotation methodsare based on visual similarity between images to be annotated and images in a trainingcorpus. The annotations of the most similar training images are transferred to the image tobe annotated. In this paper we consider using also similarities among the training images;both visual and textual; to derive pseudo relevance models; as well as crossmediarelevance models. We extend a recent state-of-the-art image annotation model toincorporate this information. On two widely used datasets (COREL and IAPR) we showexperimentally that the pseudo-relevance models improve the annotation accuracy.,British Machine Vision Conference,2010,*
Improving People Search Using Query Expansions.,Thomas Mensink; Jakob J Verbeek,Abstract. In this paper we are interested in finding images of people on the web; and morespecifically within large databases of captioned news images. It has recently been shownthat visual analysis of the faces in images returned on a text-based query over captions cansignificantly improve search results. The underlying idea to improve the text-based results isthat although this initial result is imperfect; it will render the queried person to be relativelyfrequent as compared to other people; so we can search for a large group of highly similarfaces. The performance of such methods depends strongly on this assumption: for peoplewhose face appears in less than about 40% of the initial text-based result; the performancemay be very poor. The contribution of this paper is to improve search results by exploitingfaces of other people that co-occur frequently with the queried person. We refer to this …,ECCV (2),2008,*
